## High-level description
This code defines the main entry point for a GPTScript application. It imports necessary packages and calls the `cli.Main()` function to start the command-line interface.

## Code Structure
The main package imports the `cli` package and an anonymous import for VCS (Version Control System) loaders. The `main()` function serves as the entry point, invoking `cli.Main()`.

## Symbols

### `main`
#### Description
The `main` function is the entry point of the GPTScript application. It calls `cli.Main()` to start the command-line interface.

#### Internal Logic
1. The function is defined without any parameters.
2. It calls `cli.Main()` to initiate the command-line interface.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/cli | Provides the Main function for the command-line interface |
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/loader/vcs | Loads all VCS (Version Control System) related functionality |

## Notes
1. The `_ "github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/loader/vcs"` import is a blank import, which means the package is imported for its side effects (initialization) rather than for direct use of its exported identifiers.
2. The actual implementation of the command-line interface and the application's functionality is likely contained within the `cli` package, specifically in the `Main()` function.
3. The code structure suggests that this is a minimal main file, delegating most of the functionality to the imported packages.
