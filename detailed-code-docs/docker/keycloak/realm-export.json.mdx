## Dependencies
The configuration relies on the Keycloak server and its built-in components.

## Configuration
The file itself serves as a configuration for a Keycloak realm, defining various options and behaviors for authentication and authorization.

## Error Handling
Error handling is not explicitly defined in this configuration file but is managed by the Keycloak server based on these settings.

## Future Improvements
- Consider enabling additional security features like bruteForceProtected
- Review and possibly customize authentication flows for specific use cases
- Evaluate the need for additional identity providers
- Implement custom required actions if needed for specific business logic
