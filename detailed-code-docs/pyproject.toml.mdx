title: "pyproject.toml"
---

## High-level description

The `pyproject.toml` file is a configuration file for the Python project management tool, Poetry. It defines metadata about the project, such as its name, version, authors, and dependencies. This file is essential for managing the project's dependencies, build settings, and packaging instructions, ensuring that the project can be easily installed and maintained.

## Code Structure

The `pyproject.toml` file is structured into several sections, each serving a specific purpose:

1. `[tool.poetry]`: Contains metadata about the project, such as authors, classifiers, description, and version.
2. `[tool.poetry.dependencies]`: Lists the project's dependencies, specifying the required versions for each package.
3. `[tool.poetry.build]`: Contains build-related settings, such as whether to generate a setup file and the build script to use.
4. `[build-system]`: Specifies the build backend and any additional requirements needed for building the project.
5. `[tool.poetry.scripts]`: Defines command-line scripts that can be executed as part of the project.
6. `[tool.poetry.extras]`: Lists optional dependencies grouped by feature, allowing users to install additional packages for specific use cases.

## References

The `pyproject.toml` file references the `cassiopeia.preprocess.cassiopeia_preprocess:main` function as a script entry point, which is defined in the related code snippet provided.

## Error Handling

The `pyproject.toml` file itself does not contain error handling logic, as it is a configuration file. However, errors related to dependency resolution or build processes would be handled by the tools (like Poetry) that interpret this file.

## Logging

The `pyproject.toml` file does not implement logging, as it is a configuration file. Any logging would be handled by the scripts and tools that use this configuration.

## API/Interface Reference

The `pyproject.toml` file does not define an API or public interface directly. However, it specifies a script entry point `cassiopeia-preprocess` that can be executed, which is defined in the related code snippet.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the `pyproject.toml` file.
