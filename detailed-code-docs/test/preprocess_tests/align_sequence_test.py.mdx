## High-level description

The `align_sequence_test.py` file is a unit test suite designed to validate the functionality of sequence alignment operations within the Cassiopeia pipeline. It uses the `unittest` framework to ensure that the sequence alignment process, specifically the `align_sequences` function from the `cassiopeia.pp` module, behaves as expected under various conditions. The tests cover different scenarios, including checking the structure of the alignment output, handling of large gap penalties, and verifying the correctness of default and global alignment methods.

## Code Structure

The main class in this file is `TestAlignSequence`, which inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. This class contains several test methods that each test a specific aspect of the sequence alignment functionality. The `setUp` method initializes the test data, which is used across multiple test cases.

## Symbols

### `TestAlignSequence`
#### Description
The `TestAlignSequence` class is a test case class that contains methods to test the sequence alignment functionality. It uses the `unittest` framework to define and run tests.

#### Inputs
- None directly, but it uses a predefined DataFrame `self.queries` and a reference sequence `self.reference` set up in the `setUp` method.

#### Outputs
- None directly, but it asserts conditions on the output of the `align_sequences` function.

#### Internal Logic
- **setUp**: Initializes the test data, including a DataFrame `self.queries` with sequence data and a reference sequence `self.reference`.
- **test_alignment_dataframe_structure**: Tests if the output DataFrame from `align_sequences` has the correct structure and expected columns.
- **test_extremely_large_gap_open_penalty**: Tests if a large gap open penalty results in no gaps in the alignment.
- **test_default_alignment_works**: Verifies that the default alignment settings produce expected CIGAR strings and alignment scores.
- **test_global_alignment**: Checks if the global alignment method produces the expected results.

## References

- `cassiopeia.pp.align_sequences`: This function is the main subject of the tests. It is expected to perform sequence alignment and return a DataFrame with alignment results.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `unittest` | Provides the testing framework. |
| `numpy` | Used for numerical operations, though not directly in this file. |
| `pandas` | Used to create and manipulate DataFrames for test data. |
| `cassiopeia` | The main library being tested, specifically its preprocessing module. |

## Error Handling

The test methods use assertions to handle errors. If an assertion fails, it indicates that the function under test did not behave as expected, and the test will report a failure.

## Logging

No explicit logging is implemented in this test file. The `unittest` framework handles test output and reporting.

## TODOs

No TODOs or notes are present in the code.
