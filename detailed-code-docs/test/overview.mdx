## High-level description

The `test` directory is a comprehensive suite of unit tests designed to validate the functionality of various components within the Cassiopeia library. This library is focused on phylogenetic analysis, and the tests ensure that its core functionalities, such as tree construction, manipulation, analysis, and visualization, are working as expected. The directory is organized into several subdirectories, each targeting specific modules or functionalities within the library. These include tests for tree comparison, data handling, mixin utilities, plotting, preprocessing, simulation, solvers, and tools.

## What does it do?

The tests in the `test` directory are designed to verify that the Cassiopeia library's features work correctly across a wide range of scenarios and use cases. They simulate various workflows to ensure that the library can accurately perform tasks such as:

- **Tree Comparison**: Validating tree comparison methods, including triplet correctness and Robinson-Foulds distance, to ensure accurate phylogenetic analysis.
- **Data Handling**: Ensuring the correct construction and manipulation of phylogenetic trees, character matrices, and related data structures.
- **Utility Functions**: Testing utility functions for handling ambiguous states and identifying duplicate character states in matrices.
- **Plotting**: Verifying the correctness of plotting utilities for visualizing phylogenetic trees in 2D and 3D.
- **Preprocessing**: Validating preprocessing steps such as sequence alignment, allele calling, lineage grouping, and character matrix formation.
- **Simulation**: Ensuring the reliability of simulators for modeling biological processes and data generation scenarios.
- **Solvers**: Testing solvers for reconstructing phylogenetic trees from character matrices using various algorithms.
- **Tools**: Validating tools for phylogenetic analysis, including autocorrelation, branch length estimation, evolutionary coupling, and more.

By running these tests, developers can ensure that changes to the codebase do not introduce regressions or errors in the core functionality of the Cassiopeia library.
