## High-level description

The `mixin_utilities_test.py` file is a unit test suite designed to validate the functionality of utility functions defined in the `cassiopeia.mixins.utilities` module. It uses the `unittest` framework to test functions that handle ambiguous states and identify duplicate character states in a matrix. The tests ensure that these utility functions behave as expected when dealing with both ambiguous and non-ambiguous data.

## Code Structure

The main class in this file is `TestMixinUtilities`, which inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. This class contains several test methods, each of which tests a specific function from the `utilities` module. The test methods are:

- `test_is_ambiguous_state`: Tests the `is_ambiguous_state` function.
- `test_unravel_states`: Tests the `unravel_ambiguous_states` function.
- `test_find_duplicated_character_states`: Tests the `find_duplicate_groups` function.

## References

The test file references the following functions from the `cassiopeia.mixins.utilities` module:

- `is_ambiguous_state`
- `unravel_ambiguous_states`
- `find_duplicate_groups`

## Symbols

### `TestMixinUtilities`
#### Description
`TestMixinUtilities` is a test class that contains unit tests for the utility functions in the `cassiopeia.mixins.utilities` module. It extends `unittest.TestCase` to leverage the testing framework provided by Python's `unittest` module.

#### Methods

### `test_is_ambiguous_state`
#### Description
Tests the `is_ambiguous_state` function to verify if it correctly identifies ambiguous states, which are represented as tuples.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| state | Union[int, Tuple[int, ...]] | A single character state, which can be an integer or a tuple. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | bool | True if the state is a tuple (ambiguous), False otherwise. |

### `test_unravel_states`
#### Description
Tests the `unravel_ambiguous_states` function to ensure it correctly expands lists of states containing ambiguous states into a flat list of unique states.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| state_array | List[Union[int, Tuple[int, ...]]] | A list of states, potentially containing ambiguous states. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | List[int] | A flat list of unique states. |

#### Internal Logic
The test checks two scenarios: one where the input list contains ambiguous states and one where it does not. It verifies that the function correctly unravels the ambiguous states into individual elements.

### `test_find_duplicated_character_states`
#### Description
Tests the `find_duplicate_groups` function to ensure it correctly identifies and groups duplicated character states in a character matrix.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| character_matrix | pd.DataFrame | A DataFrame representing a character matrix with potential ambiguous states. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Dict[str, Tuple[str, ...]] | A mapping of sample names to groups of samples with identical character states. |

#### Internal Logic
The test constructs a character matrix with known duplicated states and verifies that the function correctly identifies and groups these duplicates.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `unittest` | Provides the testing framework for writing and running tests. |
| `pandas` | Used to create and manipulate the character matrix for testing. |
| `cassiopeia.mixins.utilities` | Contains the utility functions being tested. |

## Error Handling

The test suite uses assertions provided by the `unittest` framework to handle errors. If a test fails, an assertion error is raised, indicating that the function did not behave as expected.

## Logging

No explicit logging is implemented in this test suite. The `unittest` framework provides output regarding test results, including any failures or errors encountered during execution.
