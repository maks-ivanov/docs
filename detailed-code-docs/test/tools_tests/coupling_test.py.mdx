## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the coupling estimators implemented in `cassiopeia/tools/coupling.py`, specifically focusing on the `compute_evolutionary_coupling` function. These tests ensure the correctness of the evolutionary coupling calculations under various scenarios, including different input parameters and data configurations.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a single test class, `TestDataUtilities`, which houses multiple test methods. Each test method focuses on a specific aspect of the `compute_evolutionary_coupling` function, such as its basic functionality, handling of custom dissimilarity maps, minimum proportion thresholds, and potential error cases.

## Symbols
### `TestDataUtilities`
#### Description
This class contains unit tests for data utility functions, specifically focusing on the `compute_evolutionary_coupling` function.

#### Inputs
* **None**

#### Outputs
* **None**

#### Internal Logic
This class utilizes the `unittest` framework to define and execute test methods. Each test method sets up a specific scenario using a predefined tree structure and cell metadata, then calls the `compute_evolutionary_coupling` function with specific parameters. The expected output is then compared to the actual output to verify the correctness of the function.

##### `test_evolutionary_coupling_basic`
* **Description:** Tests the basic functionality of the `compute_evolutionary_coupling` function with default parameters.
* **Inputs:** None
* **Outputs:** None
* **Internal Logic:**
    1. Sets up a `CassiopeiaTree` with predefined tree topology and cell metadata.
    2. Calls `compute_evolutionary_coupling` with the tree, "CellType" as the meta variable, a fixed random state, minimum proportion of 0, and 10 shuffles.
    3. Computes the expected inter-cluster distances and evolutionary coupling matrix based on the predefined data and parameters.
    4. Asserts that the calculated evolutionary coupling matrix matches the expected matrix.
    5. Asserts that a `CassiopeiaError` is raised when attempting to compute evolutionary coupling with a numerical meta variable ("nUMI").

##### `test_evolutionary_coupling_custom_dissimilarity_map`
* **Description:** Tests the functionality of `compute_evolutionary_coupling` with a custom dissimilarity map.
* **Inputs:** None
* **Outputs:** None
* **Internal Logic:**
    1. Sets up a `CassiopeiaTree` and a custom weight matrix representing the dissimilarity map.
    2. Calls `compute_evolutionary_coupling` with the tree, "CellType" as the meta variable, a fixed random state, minimum proportion of 0, 10 shuffles, and the custom dissimilarity map.
    3. Computes the expected inter-cluster distances and evolutionary coupling matrix based on the predefined data, parameters, and custom dissimilarity map.
    4. Asserts that the calculated evolutionary coupling matrix matches the expected matrix.

##### `test_evolutionary_coupling_minimum_proportion`
* **Description:** Tests the functionality of `compute_evolutionary_coupling` with a minimum proportion threshold for categories.
* **Inputs:** None
* **Outputs:** None
* **Internal Logic:**
    1. Sets up a `CassiopeiaTree` and modifies the cell metadata to include a category ("TypeD") that falls below the minimum proportion threshold.
    2. Calls `compute_evolutionary_coupling` with the tree, "CellType" as the meta variable, a fixed random state, a minimum proportion of 1/6 (which excludes "TypeC" and "TypeD"), and 10 shuffles.
    3. Asserts that the resulting evolutionary coupling matrix does not include the excluded categories ("TypeC" and "TypeD").
    4. Computes the expected inter-cluster distances and evolutionary coupling matrix based on the remaining categories and asserts that the calculated matrix matches the expected matrix.
