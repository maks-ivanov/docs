## High-level description

The `test/simulator_tests` directory contains a comprehensive suite of unit tests for various simulator classes within the Cassiopeia library. These simulators are designed to model different biological processes and data generation scenarios, such as phylogenetic tree simulation, spatial data overlay, lineage tracing, and leaf subsampling. Each test file focuses on a specific simulator class, ensuring that it functions correctly under various conditions and configurations. The tests are implemented using the `unittest` framework and cover a wide range of scenarios, including error handling, parameter validation, and expected output verification.

## What does it do?

The test suite in this directory ensures the reliability and correctness of the Cassiopeia simulators by simulating different biological processes and data generation scenarios. Here's a breakdown of the workflows and processes tested:

1. **Phylogenetic Tree Simulation**: Tests validate the generation of phylogenetic trees using different models, such as birth-death processes, complete binary trees, and subclone evolution. These tests ensure that the trees have the correct structure, branch lengths, and node properties.

2. **Spatial Data Simulation**: Tests for spatial simulators verify the overlay of spatial data onto phylogenetic trees. This includes ensuring that spatial attributes are correctly assigned to tree nodes and that existing metadata is integrated properly.

3. **Lineage Tracing**: Tests for lineage tracing simulators check the generation of lineage tracing data, ensuring that character matrices are correctly populated and that the simulators handle different configurations, such as missing data and multiple edits.

4. **Leaf Subsampling**: Tests for leaf subsamplers validate the subsampling of leaves from phylogenetic trees based on spatial attributes or uniform distribution. These tests ensure that the subsampled trees maintain the correct structure and properties.

5. **Error Handling and Edge Cases**: Across all test files, there is a strong focus on verifying that simulators handle invalid inputs and edge cases gracefully, raising appropriate exceptions and warnings when necessary.

Overall, the test suite ensures that the Cassiopeia simulators are robust, reliable, and capable of accurately modeling the intended biological processes.
