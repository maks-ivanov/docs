## High-level description

The `maxcut_test.py` file is a unit test suite for the `MaxCutSolver` class, which is part of the Cassiopeia library. This test suite verifies the functionality of the `MaxCutSolver` by testing its ability to construct connectivity graphs, evaluate cuts, and solve phylogenetic trees using the max-cut approach. The tests ensure that the solver correctly partitions samples based on their mutation data and handles various scenarios, including base cases and the use of priors.

## Code Structure

The main components of the code are the `MaxCutSolverTest` class, which contains several test methods, and the `find_triplet_structure` function. The `MaxCutSolverTest` class uses the `unittest` framework to define test cases for different functionalities of the `MaxCutSolver`. The `find_triplet_structure` function is a utility used within the tests to determine the structure of triplets in a tree.

## References

- `MaxCutSolver`: The class being tested, which is responsible for solving the max-cut problem on connectivity graphs.
- `graph_utilities`: A module that provides utility functions for graph operations, such as checking cuts and constructing connectivity graphs.

## Symbols

### `find_triplet_structure`
#### Description
Determines the structure of a triplet (three nodes) in a given tree by comparing the common ancestors of the nodes.

#### Inputs
| Name   | Type         | Description                        |
|:-------|:-------------|:-----------------------------------|
| triplet| list         | A list of three nodes (a, b, c).   |
| T      | nx.DiGraph   | A directed graph representing a tree.|

#### Outputs
| Name     | Type   | Description                                      |
|:---------|:-------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| structure| str    | A string indicating the structure of the triplet.|

#### Internal Logic
- Computes the ancestors of each node in the triplet.
- Determines the number of common ancestors between each pair of nodes.
- Returns a string indicating which pair of nodes has the most common ancestors.

### `MaxCutSolverTest`
#### Description
A test class that uses the `unittest` framework to test the functionality of the `MaxCutSolver`.

#### Methods
- `setUp`: Initializes test data and instances of `CassiopeiaTree` and `MaxCutSolver`.
- `test_check_if_cut`: Tests the `check_if_cut` function from `graph_utilities`.
- `test_evaluate_cut`: Tests the `evaluate_cut` method of `MaxCutSolver`.
- `test_graph_construction`: Tests the construction of connectivity graphs.
- `test_graph_construction_weights`: Tests graph construction with specified weights.
- `test_hill_climb`: Tests the hill-climbing optimization of cuts.
- `test_polytomy_base_case`: Tests the solver's handling of unresolved samples (polytomy).
- `test_simple_base_case`: Tests a simple case of tree resolution.
- `test_simple_base_case_priors`: Tests tree resolution with priors.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose                                      |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------------|
| `unittest` | Provides the testing framework.              |
| `networkx` | Used for graph operations and tree structures.|
| `pandas`   | Used for handling character matrices.        |
| `cassiopeia`| Provides the `MaxCutSolver` and related classes.|

## Error Handling

The test suite uses assertions to verify expected outcomes. If an assertion fails, it indicates a discrepancy between the expected and actual behavior of the `MaxCutSolver`.

## Logging

No explicit logging is implemented in the test suite. The `unittest` framework handles test results and outputs.

## TODOs

- There is a TODO comment in the `construct_connectivity_graph` function in the related `graph_utilities.py` file suggesting optimization with `numba`. This is not directly related to the test file but indicates potential future improvements in the utility functions used by the solver.
