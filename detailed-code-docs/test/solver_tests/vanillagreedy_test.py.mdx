## High-level description

The `vanillagreedy_test.py` file is a unit test suite for the `VanillaGreedySolver` class, which is part of the Cassiopeia library. This test suite uses the `unittest` framework to verify the functionality of the `VanillaGreedySolver`, particularly its ability to compute mutation frequencies, handle missing data, and solve phylogenetic trees using a greedy algorithm. The tests cover various scenarios, including handling duplicate data, ambiguous data, and missing data, as well as testing the solver's behavior with different configurations and priors.

## Code Structure

The main components of the code are:

- **`find_triplet_structure` function**: A utility function to determine the structure of a triplet in a tree.
- **`VanillaGreedySolverTest` class**: A subclass of `unittest.TestCase` that contains multiple test methods to validate different aspects of the `VanillaGreedySolver`.

## References

- **`VanillaGreedySolver`**: The class being tested, which is responsible for solving phylogenetic trees using a greedy algorithm.
- **`missing_data_methods`**: A module that provides methods for handling missing data, referenced in the tests.
- **`solver_utilities`**: A module that provides utility functions for the solver, referenced in the tests.

## Symbols

### `find_triplet_structure`
#### Description
Determines the structure of a triplet (three nodes) in a given tree by comparing the number of common ancestors between pairs of nodes.

#### Inputs
| Name   | Type         | Description                        |
|:-------|:-------------|:-----------------------------------|
| triplet| list         | A list of three nodes (a, b, c).   |
| T      | nx.DiGraph   | A directed graph representing a tree.|

#### Outputs
| Name      | Type   | Description                                      |
|:----------|:-------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| structure | str    | The structure of the triplet, either "ab", "ac", "bc", or "-". |

#### Internal Logic
- Computes the ancestors for each node in the triplet.
- Determines the number of common ancestors between each pair of nodes.
- Returns the pair with the most common ancestors as the structure.

### `VanillaGreedySolverTest`
#### Description
A test suite for the `VanillaGreedySolver` class, containing various test cases to validate its functionality.

#### Test Methods
- **`test_basic_freq_dict`**: Tests the computation of mutation frequencies with a basic character matrix.
- **`test_duplicate_freq_dict`**: Tests the handling of duplicate rows in the character matrix.
- **`test_ambiguous_freq_dict`**: Tests the handling of ambiguous states in the character matrix.
- **`test_ambiguous_duplicate_freq_dict`**: Tests the handling of ambiguous and duplicate states.
- **`test_average_missing_data`**: Tests the assignment of missing data using the average method.
- **`test_average_missing_data_priors`**: Tests the assignment of missing data with priors.
- **`test_all_duplicates_base_case`**: Tests the solver with a character matrix where all rows are duplicates.
- **`test_case_1`**: Tests a specific case with a given character matrix.
- **`test_case_2`**: Tests another specific case with a different character matrix.
- **`test_weighted_case_trivial`**: Tests the solver with trivial weights.
- **`test_priors_case`**: Tests the solver with specific priors.
- **`test_ambiguous_no_missing`**: Tests the solver with ambiguous states but no missing data.
- **`test_ambiguous_with_missing`**: Tests the solver with ambiguous states and missing data.
- **`test_ambiguous_with_missing_and_duplicates`**: Tests the solver with ambiguous states, missing data, and duplicates.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `unittest` | Provides the testing framework. |
| `itertools` | Used for generating combinations of triplets. |
| `networkx` | Used for graph operations and tree representation. |
| `pandas` | Used for handling character matrices. |
| `cassiopeia` | The main library being tested, specifically the `VanillaGreedySolver` and related utilities. |

## Error Handling

The test suite does not explicitly handle errors but relies on assertions to validate expected outcomes. If an assertion fails, it indicates a potential issue in the `VanillaGreedySolver` implementation.

## Logging

No explicit logging is implemented in the test suite. The `unittest` framework provides output for test results, including any failures or errors.

## TODOs

- There is a TODO in the `VanillaGreedySolver` class to implement a "fuzzysolver," which is not directly related to the test suite but indicates future work in the solver's implementation.
