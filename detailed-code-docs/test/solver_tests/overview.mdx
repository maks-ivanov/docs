## High-level description

The `solver_tests` directory contains a comprehensive suite of unit tests for various solver classes within the Cassiopeia library. These solvers are designed to reconstruct phylogenetic trees from character matrices using different algorithms and methodologies. The tests ensure that each solver behaves as expected under various conditions, including handling of missing data, duplicate samples, and different configurations. The directory includes tests for solvers such as `NeighborJoiningSolver`, `UPGMASolver`, `HybridSolver`, `ILPSolver`, `MaxCutSolver`, `PercolationSolver`, `SharedMutationJoiningSolver`, `SpectralNeighborJoiningSolver`, `SpectralSolver`, and `VanillaGreedySolver`.

## What does it do?

The tests in this directory validate the functionality of phylogenetic tree solvers by simulating different scenarios and configurations. Each test suite is tailored to a specific solver, ensuring that it can accurately reconstruct tree topologies from input data. The tests cover a wide range of scenarios, including:

- **Basic Functionality**: Ensuring that solvers can construct trees from simple character matrices.
- **Handling Missing Data**: Verifying that solvers can manage and impute missing data correctly.
- **Duplicate and Ambiguous Data**: Testing solvers' ability to handle duplicate samples and ambiguous character states.
- **Weighted and Prior-based Solving**: Assessing solvers' performance with weighted dissimilarities and prior probabilities.
- **Error Handling**: Ensuring that solvers raise appropriate errors for invalid inputs or configurations.
- **Integration Tests**: Running solvers on larger datasets to validate their performance and correctness in more complex scenarios.

The tests use the `unittest` framework to automate the validation process, providing a robust mechanism for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the solvers in the Cassiopeia library.
