## High-level description

The directory is part of the Cassiopeia project, a comprehensive software library designed for lineage tracing and phylogenetic analysis. It provides tools and modules for reconstructing, analyzing, and visualizing phylogenetic trees, which represent evolutionary relationships among species or genetic samples. The directory includes various components such as configuration files, build scripts, documentation, and tests to support the development and maintenance of the Cassiopeia library.

## What does it do?

The directory automates several processes and configurations essential for the development and deployment of the Cassiopeia library:

1. **Continuous Integration and Testing**: The `.github` directory contains a GitHub Actions workflow that automates the process of installing dependencies, running tests, and performing linting across multiple Python versions. This ensures that the codebase remains stable and functional with each update.

2. **Documentation**: The `docs` directory, along with the `.readthedocs.yml` file, manages the generation and hosting of the project's documentation using Sphinx and Read the Docs. It includes custom styles, templates, and extensions to enhance the documentation's appearance and functionality.

3. **Build and Installation**: The `build.py` script automates the compilation of Cython extensions, which are crucial for the performance of the library. The `pyproject.toml` and `setup.py` files manage the project's dependencies and packaging, ensuring that the library can be easily installed and maintained.

4. **Code Coverage and Quality**: The `codecov.yml` file configures the Codecov service to manage and report code coverage metrics, helping maintain high code quality by ensuring adequate test coverage.

5. **Testing**: The `test` directory contains a suite of unit tests that validate the functionality of various components within the Cassiopeia library. These tests ensure that the library's core functionalities, such as tree construction, manipulation, analysis, and visualization, work as expected.

6. **Versioning**: The `version.py` file defines the version number of the software, which is crucial for tracking releases and iterations of the library.

Overall, the directory supports the development, testing, documentation, and deployment of the Cassiopeia library, ensuring that it remains a reliable and efficient tool for phylogenetic analysis.
