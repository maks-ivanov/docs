## High-level description
This directory contains the core components of the Cassiopeia project, a comprehensive framework for single-cell lineage tracing and phylogenetic analysis. The project includes tools for data preprocessing, tree reconstruction, simulation, visualization, and various analytical utilities.

## What does it do?
Cassiopeia provides an end-to-end pipeline for analyzing single-cell lineage tracing experiments:

1. Preprocessing: Converts raw sequencing data into formats suitable for phylogenetic analysis, including filtering, error correction, and allele calling.

2. Tree Reconstruction: Implements various algorithms (greedy, distance-based, spectral, and integer linear programming) to reconstruct phylogenetic trees from mutation data.

3. Simulation: Generates synthetic phylogenetic trees and associated data for testing and validating analysis methods.

4. Visualization: Offers both local and cloud-based options for visualizing phylogenetic trees and associated data.

5. Analysis Tools: Provides utilities for parameter estimation, fitness calculation, evolutionary coupling analysis, and various tree metrics.

6. Tree Comparison: Implements methods for comparing phylogenetic trees, such as Robinson-Foulds distance and triplets correct accuracy.

## Entry points
The main entry points for the Cassiopeia package are:

1. `cassiopeia/preprocess`: For preprocessing raw sequencing data.
2. `cassiopeia/solver`: For reconstructing phylogenetic trees from processed data.
3. `cassiopeia/simulator`: For generating synthetic phylogenetic data.
4. `cassiopeia/plotting`: For visualizing phylogenetic trees and associated data.
5. `cassiopeia/tools`: For various analytical tools and utilities.
6. `cassiopeia/critique`: For comparing and analyzing phylogenetic trees.

The `cassiopeia/__init__.py` file serves as the main interface, importing and exposing key functionalities from these submodules.

## Key Files
1. `cassiopeia/data/CassiopeiaTree.py`: Defines the core data structure for representing phylogenetic trees with associated mutation data.
2. `cassiopeia/solver/CassiopeiaSolver.py`: Provides the base class for tree reconstruction algorithms.
3. `cassiopeia/simulator/TreeSimulator.py`: Offers the base class for tree simulation models.
4. `cassiopeia/plotting/local.py` and `cassiopeia/plotting/itol_utilities.py`: Implement local and cloud-based tree visualization.
5. `cassiopeia/tools/parameter_estimators.py`: Contains functions for estimating key parameters from tree data.
6. `cassiopeia/critique/compare.py`: Implements tree comparison algorithms.
7. `build.py`: Handles the building and compilation of Cython extensions for performance-critical components.
8. `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and links to documentation and tutorials.

## Dependencies
Cassiopeia relies on several external libraries:

1. numpy and pandas: For data manipulation and numerical computations.
2. networkx: For graph operations and tree manipulations.
3. scipy: For various scientific computing tasks.
4. ete3: For phylogenetic tree manipulation and visualization.

6. pysam: For handling sequencing data formats.
7. cvxpy and gurobipy: For optimization problems in some solvers.
8. Cython: For compiling performance-critical components.

## Configuration
Cassiopeia uses various configuration methods:

1. Preprocessing pipeline: Configured using an INI-format file specifying parameters for each preprocessing step.
2. Solvers: Customizable through parameters passed during initialization.
3. Simulators: Configurable via parameters set during object creation.
4. Visualization: Customizable through function parameters for both local and cloud-based plotting.
5. `pyproject.toml`: Defines project metadata, dependencies, and build settings.
6. `.readthedocs.yml`: Configures the documentation build process on Read the Docs.
7. `codecov.yml`: Sets coverage requirements for the project.

The project also includes a comprehensive test suite in the `test` directory, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the framework across its various modules and functionalities.

In summary, Cassiopeia provides a robust and flexible framework for analyzing single-cell lineage tracing data, offering tools for every step from raw data processing to advanced phylogenetic analysis and visualization.
