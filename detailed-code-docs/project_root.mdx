## High-level description
This repository contains the source code and configuration files for Trieve, a comprehensive data management and search platform. It includes various components such as a server application, frontend interfaces, deployment configurations, and scripts for setting up and managing the system.

## What does it do?
Trieve provides a wide range of functionalities:

1. Advanced search capabilities (semantic, full-text, and hybrid)
2. User authentication and authorization
3. Data ingestion and processing
4. File uploads and management
5. Chat and messaging features
6. Analytics and event tracking
7. Integration with external services (OpenAI, Stripe)
8. Deployment options for various environments (Docker Compose, Kubernetes on AWS/GCP)

The system is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing for self-hosting or cloud deployment. It includes components for embedding text, clustering similar queries, and optimizing search performance.

## Entry points
The main entry points for developers are:

1. `server/src/main.rs`: The primary entry point for the server application.
2. `frontends/`: Contains separate entry points for different frontend applications (analytics, chat, dashboard, search).
3. `docker-compose.yml`: For setting up the entire stack using Docker Compose.
4. `helm/`: Contains Kubernetes deployment configurations for cloud environments.
5. `scripts/setup-self-hosting.sh` and `scripts/configure-self-hosting.sh`: For setting up a self-hosted instance.

## Key Files
1. `server/`: Contains the core server implementation in Rust.
2. `frontends/`: Houses the frontend applications built with SolidJS.
3. `docker/`: Includes configurations for various services like ClickHouse and Keycloak.
4. `helm/`: Contains Kubernetes deployment charts.
5. `terraform/`: Includes infrastructure-as-code for AWS and GCP deployments.
6. `scripts/`: Contains utility scripts for setup and configuration.
7. `docker-compose.yml`: Defines the Docker Compose setup for local development and self-hosting.
8. `self-hosting.md`: Provides detailed instructions for self-hosting Trieve.

## Dependencies
Trieve relies on several key technologies and services:

1. Rust (for the server application)
2. SolidJS (for frontend applications)
3. PostgreSQL (primary database)
4. Qdrant (vector database for similarity search)
5. Redis (caching and message brokering)
6. ClickHouse (for analytics)
7. Keycloak (for authentication)
8. Docker and Kubernetes (for deployment)
9. Various AI models for text embedding and reranking

## Configuration
The system is highly configurable through environment variables and configuration files:

1. `.env` files for local development and Docker Compose setups.
2. `helm/values.yaml` for Kubernetes deployments.
3. Terraform configurations for cloud infrastructure setup.

Key configurable aspects include database connections, API keys for external services, authentication settings, and deployment-specific parameters.

In conclusion, Trieve is a feature-rich, scalable platform for data management and search, with flexible deployment options and a modular architecture. It combines advanced search capabilities with user management, analytics, and integration with external services, making it suitable for a wide range of applications requiring sophisticated data handling and retrieval.
