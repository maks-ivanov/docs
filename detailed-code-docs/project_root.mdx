## High-level description
This repository contains the source code and documentation for GPTScript, a framework that allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to operate and interact with various systems. GPTScript is designed to easily integrate any system, whether local or remote, with LLMs using just a few lines of prompts.

## What does it do?
GPTScript provides a set of tools and functionalities that enable:

1. Interaction between LLMs and local executables, complex applications with OpenAPI schemas, SDK libraries, or RAG-based solutions.
2. Creation of AI-powered applications for various use cases such as web scraping, code review automation, document summarization, and interactive games.
3. Execution of GPTScript programs and tools through a command-line interface.
4. Integration with different AI language models, including OpenAI's GPT models.
5. Credential management and authentication for secure API access.
6. Caching mechanisms to improve performance and reduce API calls.
7. Monitoring and logging of script execution and system events.

## Entry points
The main entry points for the GPTScript system are:

1. `main.go`: The main entry point for the GPTScript application, which initializes the command-line interface.
2. `pkg/cli`: Contains the implementation of the command-line interface.
3. `pkg/gptscript`: Provides the core `GPTScript` struct and methods for creating and running GPTScript instances.
4. `pkg/runner`: Implements the `Runner` struct for executing GPTScript programs.
5. `pkg/sdkserver`: Contains the implementation of the SDK server for standalone or embedded use.

## Key Files and Directories
1. `docs/`: Contains comprehensive documentation for GPTScript, including installation, usage, and configuration guides.
2. `examples/`: Provides a collection of diverse projects demonstrating various use cases of GPTScript.
3. `pkg/`: Contains the core implementation of GPTScript, including script execution, LLM integration, authentication, caching, and monitoring.
4. `internal/`: Defines a simple file system interface used throughout the project.
5. `integration/`: Contains integration tests and helper functions for credential-related functionality and script execution.
6. `.github/`: Includes GitHub Actions workflows for automating various processes such as testing, release management, and documentation validation.
7. `README.md`: Provides an overview of GPTScript, installation instructions, and links to documentation.

## Dependencies
GPTScript relies on several key dependencies:

1. Go standard library for core functionality.
2. `github.com/spf13/cobra` for building the command-line interface.
3. `github.com/getkin/kin-openapi` for OpenAPI parsing and schema handling.
4. `github.com/chzyer/readline` for interactive command-line input.
5. `github.com/fatih/color` for colored console output.
6. OpenAI API for accessing AI language models.

## Configuration
GPTScript uses a combination of configuration methods:

1. Environment variables for setting API keys, default models, and system behaviors.
2. Command-line flags for runtime configuration.
3. Configuration files for storing persistent settings and credentials.
4. In-code options for fine-grained configuration of various components.

Key configurable aspects include language model selection, API credentials, caching behavior, monitoring settings, and runtime environments for different programming languages.

The project is structured to allow for flexible configuration and easy extension of the GPTScript system, with each package typically providing its own configuration options that can be composed at higher levels to create the desired system behavior.
