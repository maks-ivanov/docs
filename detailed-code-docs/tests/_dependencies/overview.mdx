## High-level description

The target file `test_dependencies.py` contains unit tests for verifying the functionality of a dependency management system. It tests the presence and version compliance of certain Python packages using the `Dependency` and `DependencyManager` classes from the `marimo._dependencies.dependencies` module. The tests ensure that dependencies are correctly identified, required, and version-checked, raising appropriate errors when conditions are not met.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the test functions that utilize the `Dependency` and `DependencyManager` classes. These classes are responsible for checking the presence and version of dependencies. The test functions use these classes to verify that dependencies are correctly managed and that appropriate exceptions are raised when dependencies are missing or version mismatches occur.

## References

- `Dependency`: A class used to represent and manage individual dependencies.
- `DependencyManager`: A class that provides utilities for checking the status of multiple dependencies.
- `_version_check`: A function used to verify if a package version falls within a specified range.

## Symbols

### `test_dependencies`
#### Description
Tests the presence of two random dependencies (`altair` and `pandas`) and verifies that they can be imported and required without errors.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if `altair` and `pandas` are installed using `DependencyManager`.
- Asserts that the packages can be imported.
- Calls the `require` method to ensure the dependencies are available for testing.

### `test_without_dependencies`
#### Description
Tests the behavior when a dependency is missing, ensuring that the appropriate exception is raised.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a `Dependency` instance for a non-existent package named "missing".
- Asserts that the package is not present.
- Verifies that calling `require` raises a `ModuleNotFoundError` with the expected message.

### `test_versions`
#### Description
Tests version checking functionality for the `altair` package, ensuring that version requirements are correctly enforced.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if `altair` is installed and verifies version compliance using `require_version`.
- Asserts that a `RuntimeError` is raised when the version does not meet the minimum requirement.
- Tests the `has_at_version` method to verify version range compliance.
- Ensures that `require_at_version` raises an error when the version is outside the specified range.

### `test_version_check`
#### Description
Tests the `_version_check` function to ensure it correctly identifies whether a version is within a specified range.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Verifies that `_version_check` returns `True` for versions within the specified range.
- Asserts that it returns `False` for versions outside the range.
- Ensures that a `RuntimeError` is raised when `raise_error` is set to `True` and the version is outside the range.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `pytest`   | Used for writing and executing the unit tests. |

## Error Handling

- The tests expect `ModuleNotFoundError` to be raised when a required dependency is missing.
- `RuntimeError` is expected when a version mismatch occurs during version checks.

## Logging

No explicit logging is implemented in the test file. However, error messages are verified through exception handling.

## TODOs

No TODOs or notes are present in the code.
