## High-level description

The target file `test_marimo_pdb.py` contains a test function that verifies the integration of a custom debugger, `MarimoPdb`, within a runtime environment managed by the `Kernel` class. The test ensures that the `pdb` module is correctly patched to use `MarimoPdb` and that the standard input and output streams are properly redirected to the debugger's streams.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `test_pdb_patched` function, the `Kernel` class, and the `MarimoPdb` class. The `test_pdb_patched` function uses an instance of `Kernel` to execute a command that imports the `pdb` module, and it checks if the `pdb` module is patched to use `MarimoPdb`. The `Kernel` class is responsible for managing the execution environment, while `MarimoPdb` is a custom debugger class that extends the functionality of the standard `pdb.Pdb`.

## References

- `MarimoPdb`: A custom debugger class imported from `marimo._runtime.marimo_pdb`.
- `Kernel`: A class imported from `marimo._runtime.runtime` that manages the execution environment.
- `ExecReqProvider`: A utility class from `tests.conftest` used to create execution requests for testing.

## Symbols

### `test_pdb_patched`
#### Description
The `test_pdb_patched` function is an asynchronous test that verifies the integration of the `MarimoPdb` debugger within the `Kernel` execution environment. It checks that the `pdb` module is patched to use `MarimoPdb` and that the debugger's input and output streams are correctly set.

#### Inputs
| Name            | Type            | Description                                      |
|:----------------|:----------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| execution_kernel| `Kernel`        | An instance of the `Kernel` class used for execution. |
| exec_req        | `ExecReqProvider` | A provider for creating execution requests.      |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any outputs. It uses assertions to validate the expected behavior.

#### Internal Logic
1. The function retrieves the `Kernel` instance (`k`) from the `execution_kernel` input.
2. It uses the `Kernel` instance to run a command that imports the `pdb` module.
3. It retrieves the `pdb` module from the `Kernel`'s global namespace.
4. It asserts that the `Pdb` class in the `pdb` module is replaced with `MarimoPdb`.
5. It checks that the debugger's standard output and input streams are the same as the `Kernel`'s standard output and input streams.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo._runtime.marimo_pdb` | Provides the `MarimoPdb` class, a custom debugger. |
| `marimo._runtime.runtime` | Provides the `Kernel` class, which manages the execution environment. |
| `tests.conftest` | Provides the `ExecReqProvider` class for creating execution requests. |

## Error Handling

The test function uses assertions to handle errors. If any of the assertions fail, the test will raise an `AssertionError`, indicating that the expected behavior was not met.

## Logging

There is no explicit logging in the target file. However, the `Kernel` and `MarimoPdb` classes may have their own logging mechanisms as part of their implementation.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
