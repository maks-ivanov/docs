## High-level description

The `tests/_runtime/script_data` directory contains a set of test scripts designed to demonstrate and test exception handling within the `marimo` framework. The primary focus of these scripts is to intentionally cause division by zero errors to observe how the framework handles such exceptions. The directory includes several scripts, each structured as a standalone application using the `marimo` framework, and a utility function that performs a division by zero operation.

## What does it do?

The scripts in this directory are designed to test the behavior of the `marimo` framework when runtime exceptions occur, specifically focusing on division by zero errors. Each script defines a simple `marimo` application with one or more cells. A cell is a basic unit of execution in a `marimo` application, and it can perform computations, manage state, or interact with the user interface.

- **`func.py`**: Contains a function `divide_by_zero` that attempts to divide a given input by zero, resulting in a `ZeroDivisionError`. This function is used in other scripts to demonstrate exception handling.

- **`script_exception.py`**: Defines a `marimo` application with a single cell that directly performs a division by zero operation. The script tests how the `marimo` framework handles exceptions within cell functions.

- **`script_exception_with_imported_function.py`**: Similar to `script_exception.py`, but it imports the `divide_by_zero` function from `func.py` to perform the division by zero operation. This script tests exception handling when using imported functions within a `marimo` application.

- **`script_exception_with_output.py`**: Another variation that defines a `marimo` application with a cell that performs a division by zero. It includes a version indicator for the tool or framework used to generate the script.

## Entry points

The main files in this directory are the test scripts (`script_exception.py`, `script_exception_with_imported_function.py`, and `script_exception_with_output.py`) and the utility function file (`func.py`). Each script is structured to run as a standalone application using the `marimo` framework. The control flow in each script is centered around the `marimo.App` instance, which manages the execution of the defined cells. The data flow involves passing inputs to the cell functions, which then attempt to perform a division by zero, resulting in a `ZeroDivisionError`.

## Key Files

- **`func.py`**: Contains the `divide_by_zero` function, which is used to demonstrate a division by zero error. This function is imported and used in other scripts to test exception handling.

- **`script_exception.py`**: A test script that defines a `marimo` application with a cell that directly performs a division by zero operation.

- **`script_exception_with_imported_function.py`**: A test script that imports the `divide_by_zero` function from `func.py` and uses it within a `marimo` application to perform a division by zero operation.

- **`script_exception_with_output.py`**: A test script that defines a `marimo` application with a cell that performs a division by zero, including a version indicator for the tool or framework used to generate the script.

## Dependencies

The primary dependency for these scripts is the `marimo` framework, which is used to create and manage the applications. The `marimo` framework provides the `App` class and the `@app.cell` decorator, which are essential for defining and executing the applications. The framework is chosen for its ability to manage the lifecycle of applications and handle exceptions within cell functions.
