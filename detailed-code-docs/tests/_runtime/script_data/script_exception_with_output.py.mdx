## High-level description

The target file `script_exception_with_output.py` is a test script designed to demonstrate the behavior of a Marimo application when an exception occurs during execution. It defines a simple Marimo application with a single cell that intentionally causes a division by zero error. The script is intended to be run as a standalone application to observe how the Marimo framework handles runtime exceptions.

## Code Structure

The script is structured around the Marimo framework, which is used to define and run applications. The main components are:
- The `marimo.App` instance, which represents the application.
- A single cell defined using the `@app.cell` decorator, which contains the logic that will be executed when the application runs.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class. It serves as the main application object that manages the execution of the defined cells.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. A cell is a unit of execution that can contain any Python code. In this script, the cell is used to demonstrate an exception by performing a division by zero.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | None | The cell does not take any inputs. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | tuple | A tuple containing the values of `x` and `y`. However, due to the exception, this output is never reached. |

#### Internal Logic
The cell initializes two variables, `x` and `y`, both set to zero. It then attempts to divide `y` by `x`, which results in a division by zero error. This is intended to test the exception handling capabilities of the Marimo framework.

### `__generated_with`
#### Description
`__generated_with` is a string variable indicating the version of the tool or framework used to generate the script. In this case, it is set to "0.6.19".

## Side Effects

The script is designed to raise a `ZeroDivisionError` when executed. This is a deliberate side effect to test how the Marimo framework handles exceptions during the execution of a cell.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | The Marimo framework is used to define and run the application. |

## Error Handling

The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. Instead, it relies on the Marimo framework to handle the `ZeroDivisionError` that occurs during execution.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms. Any logging or error reporting would be handled by the Marimo framework itself.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code. The script is complete in its current form, serving its purpose as a test for exception handling in the Marimo framework.
