## High-level description
The target file `script_exception.py` is a test script designed to demonstrate and test exception handling within the `marimo` framework. It defines a simple application using `marimo.App` and includes a cell that intentionally causes a division by zero error to test how the framework handles such exceptions.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a single `marimo` application with one cell function. The cell function is decorated with `@app.cell`, indicating that it is a part of the `marimo` application. The application is executed when the script is run as the main module.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which represents the application being created and run. It is used to define and manage the lifecycle of the application, including the execution of cells.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a cell within the `marimo` application. Cells are the basic building blocks of a `marimo` application, and they can perform computations, manage state, or interact with the user interface.

### `__`
#### Description
The function `__` is a cell function that is part of the `marimo` application. It is designed to intentionally cause a division by zero error to test exception handling.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| y | Any | An input value that is used in a division operation. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| x | int | The value 0, which is used in the division operation. |
| y | float | The result of dividing the input `y` by `x`, which will cause an exception. |

#### Internal Logic
The function initializes `x` to 0 and attempts to divide `y` by `x`, which will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. This is likely intended to test how the `marimo` framework handles exceptions within cell functions.

## Side Effects
The script will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` when executed, which is a side effect of the division by zero operation within the cell function.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Provides the framework for creating and running the application, including the `App` class and cell management. |

## Error Handling
The script does not include explicit error handling for the `ZeroDivisionError`. It relies on the `marimo` framework to handle the exception, which is likely part of the test's purpose.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
