## High-level description

The target file `script_exception_with_imported_function.py` is a test script designed to demonstrate the behavior of a Marimo application when an exception occurs within a cell function. It imports a function from another module, `func`, and attempts to execute a division by zero operation, which is expected to raise an exception. The script is structured to run as a standalone application using the Marimo framework.

## Code Structure

The script is structured around the Marimo framework, which is used to define and run applications. The main components are:
- The `marimo.App` instance, which serves as the application container.
- A cell function decorated with `@app.cell`, which is the main execution unit within the Marimo application.

## References

- `marimo.App`: This is a class from the Marimo framework that is used to create and manage the application.
- `func.divide_by_zero`: This is an imported function from a module named `func`, which is expected to perform a division by zero operation.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to define and manage the lifecycle of the Marimo application. It provides the `@app.cell` decorator to define executable cells within the application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a cell within the Marimo application. Cells are the basic units of execution in a Marimo app, and they can be used to encapsulate logic that should be executed as part of the application.

### `__`
#### Description
This is a cell function defined using the `@app.cell` decorator. It imports a function from the `func` module and attempts to execute a division by zero operation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| y | any | An input parameter to the cell function, though its specific use is not detailed in the script. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| x | any | The result of the division operation, though it is expected to raise an exception before returning. |
| y | any | The second element of the tuple returned by `func.divide_by_zero`, though it is expected to raise an exception before returning. |

#### Internal Logic
- The function imports `func` and calls `func.divide_by_zero(10)`.
- The expected behavior is that this call will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` due to an attempt to divide by zero.

## Side Effects
- The script is expected to raise a `ZeroDivisionError` when executed, demonstrating exception handling within a Marimo cell.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Used to create and manage the application using the Marimo framework. |

## Error Handling
The script does not explicitly handle errors within the cell function. The expected behavior is that the division by zero operation will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`, which would need to be handled by the Marimo framework or the environment in which the script is executed.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
