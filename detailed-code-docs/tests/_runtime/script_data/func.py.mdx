## High-level description
The code in the target file defines a single function, `divide_by_zero`, which attempts to divide a given input `y` by zero. This operation will result in a runtime error, specifically a `ZeroDivisionError`, as division by zero is undefined in mathematics and not allowed in Python.

## Symbols

### `divide_by_zero`
#### Description
The `divide_by_zero` function is designed to demonstrate a division by zero error. It takes an input `y` and attempts to divide it by zero, which will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| y    | float or int | The number to be divided by zero. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| x    | int  | The value zero, which is the divisor. |
| y    | float or int | The result of the division operation, which will not be reached due to the error. |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function initializes a variable `x` to zero.
2. It attempts to divide the input `y` by `x`.
3. Since `x` is zero, this operation will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.
4. The function is intended to return the tuple `(x, y)`, but this line is never reached due to the error.

## Error Handling
The function does not include any error handling mechanisms. The division by zero will result in a `ZeroDivisionError`, which will terminate the function execution unless caught by an external try-except block.

## Side Effects
The function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` when executed, which is a side effect of attempting to divide by zero.

## Performance Considerations
There are no performance considerations for this function, as it is designed to fail with a division by zero error.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code. However, it might be beneficial to include error handling or a comment explaining the purpose of demonstrating a division by zero error.
