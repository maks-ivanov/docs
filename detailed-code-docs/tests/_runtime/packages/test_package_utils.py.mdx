## High-level description

The target file `test_package_utils.py` is a test script designed to verify the functionality of the `is_python_isolated` function from the `marimo._runtime.packages.utils` module. This function checks if the Python environment is isolated, meaning it is not using the system Python but rather a virtual environment, conda environment, or Pyodide.

## Code Structure

The test script uses the `pytest` framework to define a test case for the `is_python_isolated` function. The test is marked to be skipped on Windows platforms due to known issues with virtual environment activation in Windows CI environments.

## Symbols

### `test_is_python_isolated`
#### Description
This is a test function that asserts the `is_python_isolated` function returns `True`, indicating that the Python environment is isolated. The test is skipped on Windows platforms due to a known issue.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | N/A  | The function does not take any inputs. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | N/A  | The function does not return any outputs. It asserts a condition. |

#### Internal Logic
- The function uses the `pytest.mark.skipif` decorator to skip the test on Windows platforms.
- It calls the `is_python_isolated` function and asserts that it returns `True`.

## References

- **`is_python_isolated`**: This function is imported from `marimo._runtime.packages.utils` and is the main subject of the test. It checks if the Python environment is isolated by verifying if it is running in a virtual environment, conda environment, or Pyodide.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `pytest`   | Used for defining and running the test case. |

## TODOs

- There is a TODO comment indicating an issue with virtual environment activation on Windows CI, which is why the test is skipped on Windows platforms.

## Error Handling

The test uses `pytest.mark.skipif` to handle the known issue on Windows platforms by skipping the test, thus preventing false negatives in the test results.

## Logging

No logging mechanisms are implemented in this test script.

## Side Effects

There are no side effects from running this test, aside from the potential skipping of the test on Windows platforms due to the known issue.

## Performance Considerations

The test is simple and not performance-critical. It only involves a single function call and an assertion.
