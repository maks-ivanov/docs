## High-level description
The target file `a.py` is a minimalistic Python script that imports another module, `reload_data.c`. The import statement is followed by a comment `# noqa:F401`, which is used to suppress a specific linting warning related to unused imports.

## Code Structure
The file consists of a single import statement. The import statement is used to bring in the `reload_data.c` module, but it does not utilize any of its contents within this file.

## References
- `reload_data.c`: This module is imported but not used within the file. The purpose of importing it might be related to side effects or to ensure that the module is loaded into memory.

## Symbols

### `import reload_data.c`
#### Description
The import statement is used to include the `reload_data.c` module in the current namespace. However, the module's contents are not directly used in this file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| reload_data.c | module | The module being imported. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | N/A | The import does not produce a direct output. |

## Side Effects
The import statement may have side effects if the `reload_data.c` module contains code that executes upon import, such as initialization routines or modifications to global state.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `reload_data.c` | The module is imported, potentially for its side effects or to ensure it is loaded. |

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this file. If the `reload_data.c` module does not exist or cannot be imported, a standard `ImportError` will be raised.

## Logging

## TODOs

The file is likely part of a larger test suite or system where the presence of the `reload_data.c` module is necessary, even if its contents are not directly used in this specific file.
