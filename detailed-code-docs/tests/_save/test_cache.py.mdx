## High-level description

The `tests/_save/test_cache.py` file contains unit tests for the caching functionality of the Marimo framework. It tests the behavior of the `persistent_cache` context manager, ensuring that it correctly handles cache hits and misses. The tests verify that variables are cached and loaded as expected, using a mock loader to simulate cache interactions.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into two main classes, `TestScriptCache` and `TestAppCache`, each containing methods that test different aspects of the caching mechanism. The `TestScriptCache` class tests the caching functionality in a script-like environment, while the `TestAppCache` class tests it in an application context using an asynchronous kernel.

## References

- `App`: A class from `marimo._ast.app` used to create a notebook-like environment for testing.
- `ExecutionRequest`: A class from `marimo._runtime.requests` used to simulate execution requests in the kernel.
- `Kernel`: A class from `marimo._runtime.runtime` representing the execution environment for running code cells.
- `persistent_cache`: A context manager from `marimo._save.save` that handles caching of code blocks.
- `MockLoader`: A mock class from `tests/_save/mocks` used to simulate cache loading and saving.

## Symbols

### `TestScriptCache`
#### Description
This class contains static methods to test the caching functionality in a script-like environment. It verifies the behavior of cache misses and hits using the `persistent_cache` context manager.

#### Methods

- `test_cache_miss`: Tests the scenario where the cache is initially empty, and variables are saved to the cache.
- `test_cache_hit`: Tests the scenario where the cache already contains data, and variables are loaded from the cache.
- `test_cache_hit_whitespace`: Similar to `test_cache_hit`, but includes formatting and whitespace considerations.

#### Inputs
None directly, but the methods use the `App` class to simulate a notebook environment.

#### Outputs
None directly, but assertions are used to verify the expected behavior of the cache.

### `TestAppCache`
#### Description
This class contains asynchronous methods to test the caching functionality in an application context using a kernel. It verifies the behavior of cache misses and hits in a more complex execution environment.

#### Methods

- `test_cache_miss`: Tests the scenario where the cache is initially empty, and variables are saved to the cache in a kernel environment.
- `test_cache_hit`: Tests the scenario where the cache already contains data, and variables are loaded from the cache in a kernel environment.
- `test_cache_one_line`: Tests caching with a single line of code.
- `test_cache_comment_line`: Tests caching with comments and whitespace in the code.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| any_kernel | Kernel | The kernel instance used to run the execution requests. |

#### Outputs
None directly, but assertions are used to verify the expected behavior of the cache.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo._ast.app` | Provides the `App` class for creating a notebook-like environment. |
| `marimo._runtime.requests` | Provides the `ExecutionRequest` class for simulating execution requests. |
| `marimo._runtime.runtime` | Provides the `Kernel` class for managing execution environments. |
| `marimo._save.save` | Provides the `persistent_cache` context manager for caching code blocks. |
| `tests/_save/mocks` | Provides the `MockLoader` class for simulating cache interactions. |

## Error Handling

The tests use assertions to verify the expected behavior of the cache. If an assertion fails, it indicates that the caching mechanism did not behave as expected.

## Logging

No explicit logging is implemented in the test file. The focus is on using assertions to verify the correctness of the caching functionality.

## TODOs

No TODOs or notes are present in the code.
