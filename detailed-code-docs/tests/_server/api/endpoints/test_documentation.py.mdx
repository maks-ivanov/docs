## High-level description

The target file `test_documentation.py` contains a test function designed to verify the functionality of an API endpoint that provides documentation snippets. It uses the `TestClient` from the `starlette` framework to send HTTP requests to the `/api/documentation/snippets` endpoint and checks that the response is as expected, ensuring that the endpoint consistently returns the same set of snippets.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in this file is the `test_snippets` function, which is a test case that interacts with an API endpoint. It uses the `TestClient` to perform HTTP GET requests and asserts the correctness of the response. The function is self-contained and does not directly interact with other symbols in the codebase.

## Symbols

### `test_snippets`
#### Description
The `test_snippets` function is a test case that verifies the `/api/documentation/snippets` endpoint returns a valid response. It checks that the response status is 200 (OK), that the response contains a non-empty list of snippets, and that repeated calls to the endpoint return the same data.

#### Inputs
| Name   | Type        | Description                  |
|:-------|:------------|:-----------------------------|
| client | `TestClient` | A test client for making HTTP requests to the API. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any outputs. It uses assertions to validate the behavior of the API endpoint.

#### Internal Logic
1. The function sends a GET request to the `/api/documentation/snippets` endpoint using the provided `TestClient`.
2. It asserts that the response status code is 200, indicating a successful request.
3. It parses the response JSON and checks that the `snippets` key exists and contains a non-empty list.
4. The function stores the initial list of snippets.
5. It sends a second GET request to the same endpoint.
6. It repeats the assertions to ensure the response is consistent.
7. Finally, it asserts that the list of snippets from the second request matches the initial list, ensuring idempotency of the endpoint.

## References

The test function uses the `TestClient` from the `starlette.testclient` module to perform HTTP requests. This is crucial for understanding how the test interacts with the API.

## Dependencies

| Dependency            | Purpose                                      |
|:----------------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| `starlette.testclient` | Provides the `TestClient` for testing API endpoints. |

## Error Handling

The function uses assertions to handle errors. If any assertion fails, it will raise an `AssertionError`, indicating that the API did not behave as expected.

## Logging

There is no explicit logging in this code. The test relies on assertions to provide feedback on the test results.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
