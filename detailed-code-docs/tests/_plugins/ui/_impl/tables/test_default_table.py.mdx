## High-level description

The target file `test_default_table.py` contains unit tests for the `DefaultTableManager` class, which is part of a table management system. The tests verify the functionality of various methods in `DefaultTableManager`, such as selecting rows and columns, sorting, searching, and applying formatting to data. The tests ensure that the `DefaultTableManager` behaves correctly with both row-major and column-major data structures.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `TestDefaultTable` and `TestColumnarDefaultTable` classes, which are subclasses of `unittest.TestCase`. These classes contain methods that test different functionalities of the `DefaultTableManager`. The `DefaultTableManager` is instantiated with sample data, and its methods are called to perform operations like selecting, sorting, and formatting data. The results are then asserted against expected outcomes to verify correctness.

## References

- `DefaultTableManager`: The class being tested, which is responsible for managing table data and providing various operations on it.
- `DependencyManager`: Used to check if certain dependencies (like pandas) are available, which affects the behavior of some tests.

## Symbols

### `TestDefaultTable`
#### Description
This class tests the `DefaultTableManager` using row-major data, where each row is represented as a dictionary. It verifies the functionality of methods like `select_rows`, `select_columns`, `sort_values`, `search`, and `apply_formatting`.

#### Inputs
- `self.data`: A list of dictionaries representing row-major data.

#### Outputs
- Various assertions to verify the correctness of `DefaultTableManager` methods.

#### Internal Logic
- The `setUp` method initializes the test data and the `DefaultTableManager`.
- Each test method performs a specific operation using `DefaultTableManager` and asserts the result against expected data.

### `TestColumnarDefaultTable`
#### Description
This class tests the `DefaultTableManager` using column-major data, where each column is represented as a list. It verifies similar functionalities as `TestDefaultTable` but with a different data structure.

#### Inputs
- `self.data`: A dictionary of lists representing column-major data.

#### Outputs
- Various assertions to verify the correctness of `DefaultTableManager` methods.

#### Internal Logic
- The `setUp` method initializes the test data and the `DefaultTableManager`.
- Each test method performs a specific operation using `DefaultTableManager` and asserts the result against expected data.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `unittest` | Provides a framework for writing and running tests. |
| `pytest` | Used for marking tests, such as skipping tests based on conditions. |
| `date` | Used to create date objects for test data. |
| `DependencyManager` | Checks for the presence of optional dependencies like pandas. |
| `DefaultTableManager` | The class being tested, which manages table data. |

## Error Handling

The tests do not explicitly handle errors but rely on assertions to verify the correctness of the `DefaultTableManager` methods. If a method does not behave as expected, the test will fail, indicating an issue with the implementation.

## Logging

There is no explicit logging in the test code. The focus is on using assertions to verify the correctness of the `DefaultTableManager` methods.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code. The test cases are comprehensive and cover a wide range of functionalities provided by the `DefaultTableManager`.
