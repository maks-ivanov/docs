## High-level description

The target file `test_pandas_table.py` contains a suite of unit tests for the `PandasTableManager` class, which is part of a larger system for managing and manipulating data tables using the Pandas library. These tests verify the functionality of various methods in the `PandasTableManager`, such as data export, selection, sorting, and formatting, ensuring that the class behaves as expected when interacting with Pandas DataFrames.

## Code Structure

The main class in this file is `TestPandasTableManager`, which is a subclass of `unittest.TestCase`. This class contains multiple test methods, each designed to test a specific functionality of the `PandasTableManager`. The `setUp` method initializes a Pandas DataFrame and a `PandasTableManager` instance, which are used in the tests. The tests cover a wide range of functionalities, including data conversion to CSV and JSON, row and column selection, data sorting, and applying custom formatting.

## References

- `PandasTableManagerFactory`: Used to create instances of `PandasTableManager`.
- `ColumnSummary`: A data class used to represent summaries of DataFrame columns.
- `DependencyManager`: Used to check if the Pandas library is available.
- `FormatMapping`: A type alias for defining formatting rules.

## Symbols

### `TestPandasTableManager`
#### Description
This class contains unit tests for the `PandasTableManager` class, ensuring that it correctly handles various data manipulation tasks using Pandas DataFrames.

#### Inputs
- None directly, but uses a Pandas DataFrame initialized in `setUp`.

#### Outputs
- None directly, but asserts various conditions to validate the behavior of `PandasTableManager`.

#### Internal Logic
- **`setUp`**: Initializes a Pandas DataFrame with various data types and a `PandasTableManager` instance.
- **`test_package_name`**: Verifies that the package name is correctly identified as "pandas".
- **`test_to_csv`**: Checks if the DataFrame is correctly converted to a CSV format.
- **`test_to_json`**: Checks if the DataFrame is correctly converted to a JSON format.
- **`test_select_rows`**: Tests row selection functionality.
- **`test_select_columns`**: Tests column selection functionality.
- **`test_get_row_headers`**: Verifies the retrieval of row headers.
- **`test_is_type`**: Confirms that the manager correctly identifies Pandas DataFrames.
- **`test_get_field_types`**: Validates the detection of field types in the DataFrame.
- **`test_limit`**: Tests limiting the number of rows in the DataFrame.
- **`test_summary_*`**: Various tests to check the summary statistics for different data types.
- **`test_sort_values`**: Verifies sorting functionality.
- **`test_get_unique_column_values`**: Checks the retrieval of unique values in a column.
- **`test_search`**: Tests the search functionality within the DataFrame.
- **`test_apply_formatting_*`**: Various tests to ensure that data formatting is applied correctly without modifying the original data.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `pandas` | Used for creating and manipulating DataFrames. |
| `pytest` | Used for marking tests to be skipped if dependencies are not met. |
| `unittest` | Provides the framework for writing and running tests. |

## Error Handling

The tests use assertions to validate expected outcomes. If an assertion fails, it indicates a discrepancy between the expected and actual behavior of the `PandasTableManager`.

## Logging

No explicit logging is implemented in the test file. The test framework will handle output for test results.

## TODOs

No TODOs are present in the code.
