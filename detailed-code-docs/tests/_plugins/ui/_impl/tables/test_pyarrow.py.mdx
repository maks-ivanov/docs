## High-level description

The target file `test_pyarrow.py` contains unit tests for the `PyArrowTableManagerFactory` and its associated `PyArrowTableManager` class, which are part of a data management system using the `pyarrow` library. These tests verify the functionality of creating, manipulating, and formatting data tables and record batches using `pyarrow`, ensuring that operations like conversion to CSV/JSON, row/column selection, data summarization, and formatting are correctly implemented.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the test classes `TestPyArrowTableManagerFactory` and `TestPyArrowRecordBatchManagerFactory`. Each class contains a series of test methods that validate the behavior of the `PyArrowTableManager` created by the `PyArrowTableManagerFactory`. The tests cover a wide range of functionalities, including data conversion, selection, summarization, and formatting.

## References

- `PyArrowTableManagerFactory`: A factory class for creating instances of `PyArrowTableManager`.
- `ColumnSummary`: A data class used to represent summaries of data columns.
- `DependencyManager`: Used to check for the presence of required dependencies (`pyarrow` and `pandas`).

## Symbols

### `TestPyArrowTableManagerFactory`
#### Description
This class contains unit tests for the `PyArrowTableManager` when managing `pyarrow.Table` objects. It verifies the functionality of data conversion, selection, summarization, and formatting.

#### Inputs
- None directly, but it uses a `pyarrow.Table` created in the `setUp` method.

#### Outputs
- None directly, but it asserts various conditions to validate the functionality of the `PyArrowTableManager`.

#### Internal Logic
- The `setUp` method initializes a `PyArrowTableManager` with a sample `pyarrow.Table`.
- Each test method performs specific operations on the table and asserts expected outcomes, such as checking the package name, converting data to CSV/JSON, selecting rows/columns, and applying formatting.

### `TestPyArrowRecordBatchManagerFactory`
#### Description
This class contains unit tests for the `PyArrowTableManager` when managing `pyarrow.RecordBatch` objects. It tests similar functionalities as `TestPyArrowTableManagerFactory` but for `RecordBatch` data structures.

#### Inputs
- None directly, but it uses a `pyarrow.RecordBatch` created in the `setUp` method.

#### Outputs
- None directly, but it asserts various conditions to validate the functionality of the `PyArrowTableManager`.

#### Internal Logic
- The `setUp` method initializes a `PyArrowTableManager` with a sample `pyarrow.RecordBatch`.
- Each test method performs specific operations on the record batch and asserts expected outcomes, similar to the tests in `TestPyArrowTableManagerFactory`.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `pytest` | Used for marking tests to be skipped if dependencies are not installed. |
| `unittest` | Provides the base class for creating unit tests. |
| `pyarrow` | Used for creating and manipulating data tables and record batches. |
| `pandas` | Used in `TestPyArrowRecordBatchManagerFactory` for creating `RecordBatch` from `DataFrame`. |

## Error Handling

The tests use `pytest.mark.skipif` to skip tests if the required dependencies (`pyarrow` and `pandas`) are not installed. This ensures that tests are only run when the necessary libraries are available.

## Logging

No explicit logging is implemented in the test file. The tests rely on assertions to validate functionality, and any failures would be reported by the testing framework.

## TODOs

No TODOs or notes are present in the code.
