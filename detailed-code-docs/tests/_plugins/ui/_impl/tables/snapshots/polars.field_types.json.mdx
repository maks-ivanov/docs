## High-level description

The target file is a JSON file that maps various data types to their corresponding representations in the Polars library. It serves as a reference for understanding how different field types are interpreted or converted within the context of Polars, a DataFrame library for Rust and Python.

## Code Structure

The JSON structure consists of key-value pairs where each key represents a general data type, and the value is an array of strings that denote the equivalent or related types in Polars.

## Symbols

### JSON Key-Value Pairs
#### Description
Each key in the JSON object represents a general data type, and the associated array contains strings that represent equivalent or related data types in the Polars library. This mapping helps in understanding how different data types are handled or converted when using Polars.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON object | JSON | A collection of key-value pairs where keys are general data types and values are arrays of Polars data type representations. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Mapped types | Array of strings | Each key maps to an array of strings representing Polars data types. |

## References

This JSON file is likely referenced by test scripts or modules that need to verify or convert data types when working with Polars. It provides a standardized mapping that can be used to ensure consistency in data type handling.

## Dependencies

There are no external libraries or modules directly used in this JSON file, as it is a static configuration file.

## Configuration

This file does not define any configuration options or settings beyond the static mappings provided.

## Error Handling

There is no error handling within this JSON file itself, as it is a static data file. Error handling would be managed by the code that reads and utilizes this file.

## Logging

There are no logging mechanisms implemented in this JSON file.

## API/Interface Reference

This JSON file does not expose an API or interface directly. It is intended to be used as a reference or configuration file by other parts of the codebase.

## TODOs
