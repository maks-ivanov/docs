## High-level description

The directory contains JSON files used for testing and reference purposes within a UI plugin context, specifically related to the Polars library. Polars is a DataFrame library for Rust and Python, and these files help in verifying and understanding how different data types are handled or displayed in a UI component or data processing module. The main components include `polars.field_types.json`, which maps general data types to their Polars equivalents, and `polars.json`, which serves as a snapshot of diverse data records for testing.

## What does it do?

The JSON files in this directory serve two primary functions:

1. **Data Type Mapping**: The `polars.field_types.json` file provides a mapping between general data types and their corresponding representations in the Polars library. This is useful for developers to understand how data types are interpreted or converted when using Polars, ensuring consistency in data type handling across different parts of the application.

2. **Testing Data Snapshot**: The `polars.json` file contains an array of data records with various data types, including strings, booleans, integers, floats, datetimes, and more complex structures like lists and nested objects. This snapshot is used to test the correct handling and display of these diverse data types in a UI component or data processing module. It ensures that the application can correctly process and render different types of data.

## Key Files

- **`polars.field_types.json`**: This file is a static reference that maps general data types to their Polars equivalents. It is used to understand and verify how different data types are handled within the Polars library.

- **`polars.json`**: This file is a JSON snapshot used for testing purposes. It contains a variety of data records with different data types, serving as input data for tests or applications that need to verify the handling of diverse data types in a UI or data processing context.

## Dependencies

While the JSON files themselves do not directly reference external libraries, the related code snippet mentions dependencies on `numpy` and `pandas`. These libraries are used to handle specific data types during JSON encoding, particularly in the context of a custom JSON encoder (`WebComponentEncoder`) that might be used to serialize or deserialize the data in `polars.json`.

- **`numpy`**: Used for handling numpy-specific data types during JSON encoding.
- **`pandas`**: Used for handling pandas-specific data types during JSON encoding.
