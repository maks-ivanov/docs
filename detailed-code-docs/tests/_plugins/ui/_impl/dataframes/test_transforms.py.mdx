## High-level description

The target file `test_transforms.py` contains a unit test for verifying the functionality of parsing transformation configurations into a `Transformations` dataclass. It uses a sample transformation configuration to ensure that the `parse_raw` function correctly interprets and instantiates the `Transformations` dataclass from a dictionary input.

## Code Structure

The main function in this file is `test_parse_transforms`, which is a unit test. It uses the `parse_raw` function from the `marimo._utils.parse_dataclass` module to parse a dictionary into a `Transformations` object. The `Transformations` class is defined in the `marimo._plugins.ui._impl.dataframes.transforms.types` module and represents a collection of data transformation operations.

## References

- `Transformations`: A dataclass from `marimo._plugins.ui._impl.dataframes.transforms.types` that represents a list of transformation operations.
- `parse_raw`: A utility function from `marimo._utils.parse_dataclass` that parses a dictionary or JSON message into a specified dataclass type.

## Symbols

### `test_parse_transforms`
#### Description
This function is a unit test designed to verify that a dictionary representing transformation operations can be correctly parsed into a `Transformations` dataclass instance using the `parse_raw` function.

#### Inputs
None directly, but it uses a hardcoded dictionary within the function.

#### Outputs
None directly, but it asserts that the result is an instance of `Transformations`.

#### Internal Logic
1. A dictionary named `value` is defined, representing a transformation configuration with a single transformation of type `filter_rows`.
2. The `parse_raw` function is called with `value` and `Transformations` as arguments, which attempts to parse the dictionary into a `Transformations` dataclass.
3. An assertion checks that the result is an instance of `Transformations`, ensuring the parsing was successful.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo._plugins.ui._impl.dataframes.transforms.types` | Provides the `Transformations` dataclass and related transformation types. |
| `marimo._utils.parse_dataclass` | Provides the `parse_raw` function used to parse the dictionary into a dataclass. |

## Error Handling

The test function does not include explicit error handling but relies on the assertion to fail if the parsing does not produce an instance of `Transformations`.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in this test function.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
