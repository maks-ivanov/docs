## High-level description

The target file `tests/_plugins/stateless/test_icon.py` contains unit tests for the `icon` function from the `marimo._plugins.stateless.icon` module. These tests verify that the `icon` function correctly generates HTML representations of icons with various attributes such as size, color, inline display, and transformations like flipping.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in the code is the `test_mo_icon` function, which is a test function that uses assertions to verify the behavior of the `icon` function. The `icon` function is imported from the `marimo._plugins.stateless.icon` module and is the subject of the tests.

## References

- `icon`: This function is imported from `marimo._plugins.stateless.icon` and is the primary function being tested in this file.

## Symbols

### `test_mo_icon`
#### Description
The `test_mo_icon` function is a unit test designed to verify the correct behavior of the `icon` function. It checks that the HTML output generated by the `icon` function matches expected values for different input parameters.

#### Inputs
This function does not take any inputs as it is a test function.

#### Outputs
This function does not return any outputs. It uses assertions to validate the behavior of the `icon` function.

#### Internal Logic
- The function first tests the default behavior of the `icon` function with the icon name "lucide:leaf" and checks if the output matches the expected inline HTML representation.
- It then tests the `size` parameter by setting it to 32 and verifies that the width and height attributes are correctly set in the HTML output.
- The `color` parameter is tested by setting it to "red" and checking if the style attribute in the HTML output reflects this color.
- The `inline` parameter is tested by setting it to `False` and verifying that the inline attribute is absent in the HTML output.
- Finally, the `flip` parameter is tested by setting it to "horizontal" and checking if the flip attribute is correctly included in the HTML output.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo._plugins.stateless.icon` | Provides the `icon` function that is being tested. |

## Error Handling

The test function uses assertions to handle errors. If any assertion fails, it indicates that the `icon` function did not produce the expected output, and the test will fail.

## Logging

There is no explicit logging in this test file. The test framework used (likely `pytest` or similar) would handle the output of test results.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
