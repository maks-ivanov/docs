## High-level description

The `test_config.py` file contains unit tests for the configuration management functionalities of the Marimo application. These tests ensure that configuration settings can be correctly merged, overridden, and manipulated, including handling sensitive information like API keys. The tests validate the behavior of configuration-related functions such as merging configurations, masking secrets, and removing secret placeholders.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are functions that test various aspects of the configuration management system. These functions utilize configuration-related utilities imported from the `marimo._config.config` module. The tests are organized to cover different scenarios, such as partial and full configuration overrides, handling unknown configuration keys, and managing sensitive information.

## References

The code references several functions and constants from the `marimo._config.config` module, including:
- `DEFAULT_CONFIG`
- `MarimoConfig`
- `mask_secrets`
- `merge_config`
- `merge_default_config`
- `remove_secret_placeholders`

These references are crucial for understanding how the tests interact with the configuration management system.

## Symbols

### `assert_config`
#### Description
The `assert_config` function is a helper function used to assert that a given configuration override, when merged with the default configuration, results in the expected configuration.

#### Inputs
| Name     | Type         | Description                        |
|:---------|:-------------|:-----------------------------------|
| override | MarimoConfig | The configuration to be overridden |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Merges the provided `override` configuration with the default configuration using `merge_default_config`.
- Asserts that the resulting configuration matches the expected configuration, which is a combination of `DEFAULT_CONFIG` and the `override`.

### `test_configure_partial_keymap`
#### Description
Tests the configuration of a partial keymap override.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Calls `assert_config` with a `MarimoConfig` that specifies a partial keymap configuration.

### `test_configure_full`
#### Description
Tests the configuration of a full set of configuration options.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Calls `assert_config` with a `MarimoConfig` that specifies a comprehensive set of configuration options, including completion, save, keymap, and package management settings.

### `test_configure_unknown`
#### Description
Tests the behavior when an unknown configuration key is provided.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Calls `assert_config` with a configuration that includes an unknown key, ensuring that the system can handle unexpected configuration keys gracefully.

### `test_merge_config`
#### Description
Tests the merging of configurations, ensuring that existing keys are preserved and new keys are added.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Merges a configuration containing an API key with another configuration specifying a model.
- Asserts that the API key is preserved and the model is added in the resulting configuration.

### `test_merge_config_with_keymap_overrides`
#### Description
Tests the merging of configurations with keymap overrides, ensuring that overrides are correctly handled.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Merges configurations with different keymap presets and overrides.
- Asserts that the resulting configuration reflects the correct merging behavior, including the removal of specific overrides.

### `test_mask_secrets`
#### Description
Tests the masking of secrets in a configuration, ensuring sensitive information is obscured.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Masks the API key in a configuration and asserts that it is replaced with a placeholder.
- Ensures that the original configuration remains unmodified.

### `test_mask_secrets_empty`
#### Description
Tests the masking of secrets when the secret key is absent or empty.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Masks a configuration without an API key and asserts that no placeholder is added.
- Tests the behavior when the API key is an empty string, ensuring it remains unchanged.

### `test_remove_secret_placeholders`
#### Description
Tests the removal of secret placeholders from a configuration.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Removes placeholders from a configuration and asserts that the keys with placeholders are removed.
- Ensures that the original configuration remains unmodified.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo._config.config` | Provides configuration management utilities and constants used in the tests. |

## Error Handling

The tests include type ignore comments to handle specific type-checking scenarios, such as unknown keys in typed dictionaries. This ensures that the tests can focus on functional correctness without being hindered by type-checking limitations.

## Logging

No explicit logging mechanisms are implemented in the test code. The tests rely on assertions to validate behavior, which is typical for unit tests.
