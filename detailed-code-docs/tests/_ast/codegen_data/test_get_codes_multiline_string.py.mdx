## High-level description

The target file `test_get_codes_multiline_string.py` is a test script that uses the `marimo` library to define a simple application with a single cell. The cell function `one` returns a multiline string. The script is designed to be executed as a standalone application using the `marimo` framework.

## Code Structure

The code consists of a single `marimo` application with one cell function. The `marimo.App` class is used to create an application instance, and the `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell function within this application. The cell function `one` is responsible for returning a multiline string.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which represents the application being created. It is used to define and manage the lifecycle of the application, including the execution of cell functions.

### `one`
#### Description
The `one` function is a cell function defined within the `marimo` application. It returns a multiline string as a tuple.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | N/A  | The function does not take any inputs. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| c    | tuple | A tuple containing a multiline string. |

#### Internal Logic
The function `one` defines a variable `c` that holds a multiline string. The string is defined using triple quotes and contains the text `"  a, b"`. The function then returns this string as a tuple.

## Side Effects
There are no notable side effects in this code. The function simply returns a value without modifying any external state.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Used to create and manage the application and its cell functions. |

## Error Handling
The code does not implement any specific error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the `marimo` library functions as expected.

## Logging
The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The code does not expose any API or public interface beyond the `marimo` application structure.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
