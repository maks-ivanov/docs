## High-level description

The target file `test_generate_filecontents_empty_with_config.py` is a test script that utilizes the `marimo` library to create and run a simple application. The script sets up an application with a specified width and title, and then executes it. This file is likely used to verify that the application can be generated and run with a specific configuration.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in the code is the `app` object, which is an instance of the `marimo.App` class. This object is configured with specific parameters and is responsible for running the application when the script is executed.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
The `app` symbol is an instance of the `marimo.App` class. It is configured with a full-width layout and a title of "test_title". The purpose of this symbol is to represent the application that will be run when the script is executed.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| width | str | Specifies the width of the application layout. |
| app_title | str | Sets the title of the application. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| app | marimo.App | The configured application instance. |

#### Internal Logic
The `app` object is created by calling the `marimo.App` constructor with the specified configuration parameters. The object is then used to run the application when the script is executed.

## Side Effects

- The script, when executed, will start the application using the `app.run()` method. This will likely open a user interface or perform some action defined by the `marimo` library.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Provides the `App` class used to create and run the application. |

## Error Handling

The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It relies on the `marimo` library to manage any exceptions or errors that occur during the execution of the application.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms. Any logging would be handled by the `marimo` library if it provides such functionality.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is a standalone script intended to be executed directly.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
