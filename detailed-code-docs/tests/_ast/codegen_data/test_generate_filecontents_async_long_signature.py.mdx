## High-level description
The target file is a test script that uses the `marimo` library to define and run an application with asynchronous and synchronous cells. It demonstrates the use of the `marimo.App` class to create an application and define cells that perform specific tasks, including handling asynchronous data streams.

## Code Structure
The code is structured around the `marimo.App` class, which is used to create an application instance. The application is composed of cells, which are defined using the `@app.cell` decorator. There are two main cells in this script: one synchronous (`one`) and one asynchronous (`two`). The asynchronous cell demonstrates how to handle data streams using an asynchronous generator.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object. It is used to define and manage the lifecycle of the application and its cells.

### `one`
#### Description
The `one` function is a synchronous cell that initializes and returns a tuple of four identical integer values.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | tuple | A tuple containing four integer values, each set to 1. |

### `two`
#### Description
The `two` function is an asynchronous cell that processes data from a WebSocket client. It retrieves configuration and condition data, then iterates over data points received from a WebSocket connection.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| client | callable | A function to initiate a WebSocket connection. |
| get_calculation_trigger | callable | A function to retrieve a calculation trigger. |
| get_components_configuration | callable | A function to retrieve component configuration. |
| get_conditions_state | callable | A function to retrieve the state of conditions. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data_point | object | The last data point received from the WebSocket connection. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the current state of conditions and component configuration.
2. Constructs a dictionary combining configuration and condition data.
3. Retrieves a calculation trigger.
4. Asynchronously iterates over data points from a WebSocket connection, printing each data point.
5. Returns the last data point received.

## Side Effects
- The `two` function prints each data point received from the WebSocket connection to the console.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Provides the `App` class and decorators for defining application cells. |

## Error Handling
The code does not explicitly handle errors. Any exceptions raised during the execution of the cells or the WebSocket connection will propagate up the call stack.

## Logging
The code uses a simple `print` statement to log data points received from the WebSocket connection.

## API/Interface Reference
The code does not define an external API or interface. It is a standalone script intended to be run as a test.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
