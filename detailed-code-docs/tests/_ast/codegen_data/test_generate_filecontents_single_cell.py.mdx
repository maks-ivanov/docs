## High-level description

The target file `test_generate_filecontents_single_cell.py` is a test script that uses the `marimo` library to define a simple application with a single cell. The cell imports the `numpy` library and returns it. The script is designed to be executed as a standalone application using the `marimo` framework, which is indicated by the `app.run()` call in the `__main__` block.

## Code Structure

The code consists of a single `marimo` application with one cell. The `marimo.App` class is instantiated to create an application object, and the `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell function within this application. The cell function imports `numpy` and returns it. The application is then run if the script is executed directly.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class. It represents the application being created and managed by the `marimo` framework. The `app` object is used to define cells and run the application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the `marimo` application. A cell is a unit of computation or functionality that can be executed as part of the application. In this script, the cell is a function named `one` that imports and returns the `numpy` library.

### `one`
#### Description
The `one` function is a cell in the `marimo` application. It imports the `numpy` library and returns it as a tuple.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | N/A  | The function does not take any inputs. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | tuple | A tuple containing the `numpy` module. |

#### Internal Logic
The function imports the `numpy` library using the alias `np` and returns it in a tuple. This is a simple operation that demonstrates the use of the `marimo` framework to define a cell.

### `__generated_with`
#### Description
`__generated_with` is a string variable that indicates the version of the tool or framework used to generate the code. In this case, it is set to "0.1.0".

## Side Effects

- The script imports the `numpy` library when the `one` function is executed.
- The script runs the `marimo` application when executed as a standalone script.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Used to create and manage the application and its cells. |
| `numpy`    | Imported and returned by the cell function `one`. |

## Error Handling

The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. Any errors during the import of `numpy` or execution of the `marimo` application would result in exceptions being raised.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
