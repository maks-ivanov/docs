## High-level description

The target file `test_generate_filecontents_async.py` is a test script that uses the `marimo` library to define and run an asynchronous application. It defines several functions (or "cells") that demonstrate asynchronous operations using Python's `asyncio` library. The script is structured to test the generation of file contents in an asynchronous context.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `marimo.App` instance `app` and the functions decorated with `@app.cell`. These functions are defined to demonstrate asynchronous operations and are executed when the application runs. The `app.run()` call at the end of the script initiates the execution of these functions.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which is used to manage and execute the defined cells (functions) in the script. It serves as the main application object that coordinates the execution of the decorated functions.

### `one`
#### Description
The `one` function is a synchronous cell that imports the `numpy` and `asyncio` libraries and returns them. This function demonstrates the ability to import and return modules within a cell.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name    | Type   | Description                        |
|:--------|:-------|:-----------------------------------|
| asyncio | module | The `asyncio` module               |
| np      | module | The `numpy` module                 |

### `two`
#### Description
The `two` function is an asynchronous cell that takes the `asyncio` module as an input, performs an asynchronous sleep operation, and returns two integer values. This function demonstrates the use of asynchronous operations within a cell.

#### Inputs
| Name    | Type   | Description                        |
|:--------|:-------|:-----------------------------------|
| asyncio | module | The `asyncio` module               |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description                        |
|:-----|:-----|:-----------------------------------|
| x    | int  | An integer initialized to 0        |
| xx   | int  | An integer initialized to 1        |

#### Internal Logic
- Initializes two integers, `x` and `xx`.
- Uses `await asyncio.sleep(1)` to pause execution for 1 second asynchronously.
- Returns the integers `x` and `xx`.

### `three`
#### Description
The `three` function is a synchronous cell that defines an asynchronous inner function `_` which performs an asynchronous sleep operation. This function demonstrates defining and using an asynchronous function within a synchronous cell.

#### Inputs
| Name    | Type | Description                        |
|:--------|:-----|:-----------------------------------|
| asyncio | module | The `asyncio` module             |
| x       | int   | An integer representing sleep time|

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Defines an asynchronous inner function `_` that uses `await asyncio.sleep(x)` to pause execution for `x` seconds.
- The function does not return any value or execute the inner function.

## Side Effects
- The script imports the `numpy` and `asyncio` modules within the `one` function.
- The `two` function performs an asynchronous sleep operation, which introduces a delay in execution.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose                                      |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------------|
| marimo    | Used to create and manage the application and its cells. |
| numpy     | Imported within the `one` function for demonstration purposes. |
| asyncio   | Used for asynchronous operations within the cells. |

## Error Handling
The script does not implement specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on the default behavior of Python's exception handling.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is a standalone test script intended to demonstrate asynchronous operations using the `marimo` library.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
