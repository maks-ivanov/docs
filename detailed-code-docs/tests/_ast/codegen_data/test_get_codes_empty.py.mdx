## High-level description
The target file `test_get_codes_empty.py` is a test script that uses the `marimo` library to define a simple application with two empty cells. The script is designed to run the application, which is likely part of a testing framework to verify the behavior of the `marimo` library when handling empty cell functions.

## Code Structure
The code defines a `marimo` application and two cell functions, `one` and `two`, both of which are empty and return nothing. The application is executed when the script is run as the main module.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which represents the application being defined and run in this script. It is used to register cell functions and manage their execution.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to register functions as cells within the `marimo` application. These cells are likely intended to be executed or tested as part of the application's workflow.

### `one`
#### Description
The `one` function is a cell function registered with the `marimo` application. It is defined to do nothing and return immediately.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

### `two`
#### Description
The `two` function is another cell function registered with the `marimo` application. Like `one`, it is defined to do nothing and return immediately.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

### `if __name__ == "__main__":`
#### Description
This conditional block checks if the script is being run as the main module and, if so, executes the `app.run()` method to start the application.

## References
- The `marimo` library is referenced, specifically the `marimo.App` class and the `@app.cell` decorator, which are central to the script's functionality.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Used to create and manage the application and its cells. |

## Error Handling
The script does not include any explicit error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the `marimo` library will handle any exceptions or errors that occur during the execution of the application.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose any API or public interface. It is a standalone script intended to be executed directly.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
