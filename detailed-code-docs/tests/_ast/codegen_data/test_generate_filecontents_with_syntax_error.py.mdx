## High-level description

The target file `test_generate_filecontents_with_syntax_error.py` is a test script designed to verify the behavior of the `marimo` framework when handling code cells with syntax errors. It defines a series of code cells, some of which are intentionally malformed, to test the framework's ability to parse and manage these errors. The script uses the `marimo.App` class to define and run these cells.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `marimo.App` instance `app` and the decorator `@app.cell`, which is used to define executable code cells. The `app._unparsable_cell` method is used to define cells with syntax errors. The script concludes with a conditional block that runs the application if the script is executed as the main module.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
An instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object for defining and running code cells.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
A decorator used to define a function as a code cell within the `marimo` application. These cells can contain executable code that the application will run.

### `app._unparsable_cell`
#### Description
Defines a code cell that contains syntax errors. This method is used to test how the `marimo` framework handles cells that cannot be parsed correctly.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| code | str | A string containing the code with syntax errors. |
| name | str | The name of the cell. |

#### Outputs
This method does not produce direct outputs but affects the application's behavior by introducing syntax errors for testing purposes.

### `one`
#### Description
A code cell defined using the `@app.cell` decorator. It imports the `numpy` library and returns it.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| np | module | The `numpy` module. |

### `__`
#### Description
A code cell defined using the `@app.cell` decorator. It contains a simple return statement with a string comment `'all good'`.

## Side Effects

- The `app._unparsable_cell` method introduces syntax errors into the application, which are intended to test the framework's error handling capabilities.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Provides the framework for defining and running code cells. |
| `numpy` | A numerical computing library imported in one of the code cells. |

## Error Handling

The script is designed to test error handling by introducing syntax errors through the `app._unparsable_cell` method. The framework's response to these errors is part of what the test aims to verify.

## Logging

The script does not explicitly implement logging, but the `marimo` framework may have internal logging mechanisms to handle and report syntax errors.

## TODOs

There are no explicit TODOs or notes left in the code. The script appears to be complete for its intended purpose of testing syntax error handling in the `marimo` framework.
