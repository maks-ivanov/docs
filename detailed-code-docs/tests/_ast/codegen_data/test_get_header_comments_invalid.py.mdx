## High-level description
The target file `test_get_header_comments_invalid.py` is a test script designed to verify the behavior of the `marimo` application framework when handling invalid header comments. It includes a simple application setup using `marimo` and demonstrates how the framework processes header comments that are not correctly formatted according to expected conventions.

## Code Structure
The code is structured around the `marimo` application framework. It defines a simple application with two cells and includes header comments that are intentionally invalid to test the framework's handling of such cases.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which represents the application being tested. It is used to define and run the application.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | N/A  | N/A         |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| app  | App  | An instance of the `marimo.App` class |

### `one`
#### Description
`one` is a cell function defined within the `marimo` application. It is a placeholder function that does not perform any operations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | N/A  | N/A         |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | N/A  | N/A         |

### `two`
#### Description
`two` is another cell function defined within the `marimo` application. Like `one`, it is a placeholder function that does not perform any operations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | N/A  | N/A         |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | N/A  | N/A         |

## Side Effects
- The script prints "Hello World" to the console.
- It sets up a `marimo` application with two cells, which can be executed when the script is run.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Used to create and manage the application framework and cells. |

## Error Handling
The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It is assumed that any errors related to invalid header comments would be handled by the `marimo` framework or during the test execution.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose any API or public interface. It is a standalone test script intended to be executed directly.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
