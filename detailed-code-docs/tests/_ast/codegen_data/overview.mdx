## High-level description

The `tests/_ast/codegen_data` directory contains a series of test scripts designed to evaluate the functionality and robustness of the `marimo` library. This library is used to create and manage applications composed of computational cells, which are essentially functions that can be executed in a controlled manner. The test scripts cover a wide range of scenarios, including synchronous and asynchronous operations, error handling, and the use of external libraries like `numpy`. Each script is structured to define an application using the `marimo.App` class and to register functions as cells within this application using the `@app.cell` decorator.

## What does it do?

The test scripts in this directory demonstrate various workflows and processes that can be implemented using the `marimo` library. Here's a breakdown of the key functionalities:

1. **Basic Application Setup**: Many scripts demonstrate the basic setup of a `marimo` application, where an instance of `marimo.App` is created, and functions are registered as cells. These cells perform simple operations like arithmetic calculations or importing libraries.

2. **Asynchronous Operations**: Some scripts, such as `test_generate_filecontents_async.py`, showcase the use of Python's `asyncio` library to perform asynchronous operations within cells. This includes asynchronous sleep operations and handling data streams.

3. **Error Handling and Edge Cases**: Several scripts are designed to test the framework's handling of errors and edge cases. For example, `test_generate_filecontents_with_syntax_error.py` introduces syntax errors to test error handling, while `test_get_codes_with_incorrect_args_rets.py` tests the handling of incorrect argument and return types.

4. **Handling of Built-in Functions**: Scripts like `test_generate_filecontents_shadowed_builtin.py` and `test_generate_filecontents_unshadowed_builtin.py` explore the behavior of the framework when built-in Python functions are shadowed or referenced within cells.

5. **Configuration and Metadata**: Some scripts, such as `test_generate_filecontents_empty_with_config.py`, demonstrate how to configure an application with specific parameters like width and title. Metadata variables like `__generated_with` are used to indicate the version of the tool or library used to generate the code.

6. **Multiline and Complex Function Definitions**: The directory includes tests for handling multiline function definitions and complex function signatures, as seen in `test_get_codes_multiline_fndef.py` and `test_get_codes_multiline_string.py`.

7. **Header Comments and Documentation**: Scripts like `test_get_header_comments.py` and `test_get_header_comments_invalid.py` test the handling of header comments, including cases where comments are not correctly formatted.

Overall, these test scripts serve as a comprehensive suite to validate the functionality of the `marimo` library across various scenarios, ensuring that it can handle both typical use cases and potential edge cases effectively.
