## High-level description

The target file `test_get_codes_with_name_error.py` is a test script designed to verify the behavior of a Marimo application when a `NameError` is present in the code. It defines a simple Marimo application with a single cell that references an undefined variable `mo`, which should trigger a `NameError` when executed. The script is intended to be run as a standalone application to observe the error handling of the Marimo framework.

## Code Structure

The code consists of a Marimo application with a single cell function. The application is created using the `marimo.App()` class, and the cell is defined using the `@app.cell` decorator. The main function of the script is to run the application using `app.run()`.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which represents the Marimo application. It is used to define and manage the application's cells and to execute the application.

### `one`
#### Description
The `one` function is a cell in the Marimo application. It is decorated with `@app.cell`, indicating that it is a part of the application's execution flow. The function references an undefined variable `mo`, which is intended to trigger a `NameError`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | unknown | An undefined variable intended to trigger a `NameError` |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | NoneType | The function does not return any value |

#### Internal Logic
The function simply references the variable `mo` and then returns. The reference to `mo` is expected to cause a `NameError` since `mo` is not defined within the function or passed as an argument.

## Side Effects

The script is expected to raise a `NameError` when executed due to the undefined variable `mo` in the `one` function.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Used to create and manage the Marimo application and its cells |

## Error Handling

The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. The `NameError` is expected to occur naturally when the script is executed, serving as a test case for the Marimo framework's error handling capabilities.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
