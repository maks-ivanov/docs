## High-level description

The target file is a test script that uses the `marimo` library to define a simple application with a single cell function. The function `one` prints "hi" and returns. The script is designed to be run as a standalone application, and it includes a comment after the function signature to test the handling of such comments in the code generation process.

## Code Structure

The main components of the code are the `marimo` library, the `App` instance, and the `one` function decorated with `@app.cell`. The `App` instance is used to manage the lifecycle of the application, and the `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell function within the application.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to manage the application. It provides the functionality to define cell functions and run the application.

### `one`
#### Description
The `one` function is a cell function defined within the `marimo` application. It prints "hi" to the console and returns. The function includes a comment after its signature, which is likely intended to test the handling of such comments in the code generation process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | N/A  | The function does not take any inputs. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | N/A  | The function does not return any value. |

#### Internal Logic
The function simply executes a `print` statement to output "hi" to the console and then returns.

### `__generated_with`
#### Description
This is a metadata variable indicating the version of the tool or library used to generate the code. In this case, it is set to '0.1.0'.

## Side Effects

- The `one` function prints "hi" to the console when executed.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Used to create and manage the application, and to define cell functions. |

## Error Handling

The script does not include any explicit error handling mechanisms. It relies on the `marimo` library to manage any errors that occur during the execution of the application.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms. It only includes a simple print statement within the `one` function.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose any API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
