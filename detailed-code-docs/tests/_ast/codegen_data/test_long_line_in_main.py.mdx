## High-level description

The target file `test_long_line_in_main.py` is a test script that uses the `marimo` library to define and run a simple application. It defines two functions, `one` and `two`, as cells within a `marimo.App` instance. The script is designed to test the handling of long variable names and the execution of these functions within the `marimo` framework.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `marimo.App` instance and the two functions `one` and `two` decorated with `@app.cell`. The `marimo.App` instance is used to manage the execution of these functions, which are defined as cells within the application. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to run the application when the script is executed directly.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which is used to manage and execute the functions defined as cells within the application.

### `one`
#### Description
The function `one` is defined as a cell within the `marimo.App` instance. It initializes three variables with long names to zero and returns them as a tuple.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | tuple | A tuple containing three integer variables initialized to zero. |

### `two`
#### Description
The function `two` is also defined as a cell within the `marimo.App` instance. It takes three input parameters, sums them, and returns the result as a tuple.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| i_am_a_very_long_name | int | An integer input. |
| i_am_another_very_long_name | int | Another integer input. |
| yet_another_very_long_name | int | A third integer input. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| z | tuple | A tuple containing the sum of the three input integers. |

#### Internal Logic
The function calculates the sum of the three input parameters and returns the result as a single-element tuple.

### `app.run()`
#### Description
The `app.run()` method is called to execute the application. It triggers the execution of the functions defined as cells within the `marimo.App` instance.

## References

The code references the `marimo` library, specifically the `marimo.App` class and the `@app.cell` decorator, which are used to define and manage the execution of the functions `one` and `two`.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Used to create and manage the application and its cells. |

## Error Handling

The code does not implement specific error handling mechanisms beyond basic Python exception handling. Any errors during the execution of the functions or the application would result in standard Python exceptions.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms. Any output or errors would be handled by the standard output and error streams.

## API/Interface Reference

The code does not explicitly define an API or public interface. It is a standalone script intended to be executed directly.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
