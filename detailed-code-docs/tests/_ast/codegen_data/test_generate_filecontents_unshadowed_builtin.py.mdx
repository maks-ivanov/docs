## High-level description

The target file `test_generate_filecontents_unshadowed_builtin.py` is a test script that uses the `marimo` library to define a simple application. The script defines a single cell function named `one` that references the built-in `type` function but does not perform any operations with it. The application is then executed using `app.run()` if the script is run as the main module.

## Code Structure

The code consists of a few key components:
- The `marimo` library is imported and used to create an application instance.
- A cell function `one` is defined using the `@app.cell` decorator, which is a feature of the `marimo` library to define reactive components or functions.
- The script includes a conditional block to run the application if the script is executed directly.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to manage the lifecycle and execution of the application. It serves as the main entry point for defining and running the application.

### `one`
#### Description
The `one` function is a cell function defined using the `@app.cell` decorator. It references the built-in `type` function but does not perform any operations or return any meaningful value.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
The function simply references the `type` function and returns immediately without performing any operations.

### `__generated_with`
#### Description
This is a metadata variable indicating the version of the tool or library used to generate the code. In this case, it is set to `"0.1.0"`.

## References

- The `marimo` library is referenced and used to create an application instance and define cell functions.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Used to create and manage the application, and to define reactive cell functions. |

## Error Handling

There is no explicit error handling in this script. The script assumes that the `marimo` library and its components function as expected.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in this script.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose any API or public interface. It is a standalone test script intended to be executed directly.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
