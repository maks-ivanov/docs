## High-level description

The target file `test_main.py` is a test script that uses the `marimo` library to define a simple application with three computational cells. Each cell performs basic arithmetic operations and returns the results. The script is designed to be executed as a standalone application, running the defined cells in sequence.

## Code Structure

The main components of the code are the `marimo.App` instance and the three cell functions (`one`, `two`, and `three`). Each function is decorated with `@app.cell`, indicating that they are part of the `marimo` application. The functions are executed in sequence when the application is run.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object. It manages the execution of the defined cells and orchestrates the flow of data between them.

### `one`
#### Description
The `one` function is a cell that initializes a variable `x` to zero and returns it as a tuple.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| x | Tuple[Any] | A tuple containing the integer 0. |

### `two`
#### Description
The `two` function takes an input `x`, increments it by one to produce `y`, then increments `y` by one to produce `z`. It returns both `y` and `z` as a tuple.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| x | Any | An input value, expected to be an integer. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| y, z | Tuple[Any, Any] | A tuple containing the incremented values of `x`. |

### `three`
#### Description
The `three` function takes two inputs, `x` and `y`, adds them together to produce `a`, and returns `a` as a tuple.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| x | Any | The first input value. |
| y | Any | The second input value. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| a | Tuple[Any] | A tuple containing the sum of `x` and `y`. |

### `__main__`
#### Description
The `__main__` block checks if the script is being run as the main module and executes `app.run()`, which triggers the execution of the defined cells in sequence.

## References

- The `marimo` library is used to create and manage the application and its cells.
- The `Tuple` and `Any` types from the `typing` module are used for type annotations.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Provides the `App` class and `@app.cell` decorator for defining and managing computational cells. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the operations within each cell will execute without exceptions.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
