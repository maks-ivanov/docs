## High-level description

The target file `test_generate_filecontents_shadowed_builtin.py` is a test script that uses the `marimo` library to define and run a simple application. It demonstrates the use of the `marimo.App` class to create an application with two cells, each defined by a function. The script tests the behavior of shadowing built-in Python names, specifically the `type` function, within these cells.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `marimo.App` instance `app` and the two functions `one` and `two`, which are decorated with `@app.cell`. These functions define the cells of the application. The `app.run()` call at the end of the script executes the application.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to create and manage the application. It serves as a container for the cells defined in the script.

### `one`
#### Description
The function `one` is a cell in the `marimo` application that demonstrates shadowing the built-in `type` function by assigning the integer `1` to a variable named `type`.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| type | tuple | A tuple containing the integer `1` |

#### Internal Logic
The function assigns the integer `1` to a variable named `type`, which shadows the built-in `type` function. It then returns a tuple containing this variable.

### `two`
#### Description
The function `two` is another cell in the `marimo` application that takes a parameter named `type`, which shadows the built-in `type` function. The function does not perform any operations with this parameter.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| type | any | A parameter that shadows the built-in `type` function |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
The function accepts a parameter named `type` but does not perform any operations with it. It simply returns `None`.

## Side Effects

- The script shadows the built-in `type` function within the scope of the `one` and `two` functions, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the built-in `type` function is needed within these scopes.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Used to create and manage the application and its cells. |

## Error Handling

The script does not implement any specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on the `marimo` library to manage the execution of the application and handle any errors that may occur.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
