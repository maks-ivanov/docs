## High-level description
The target file is a test script for the `marimo` library, specifically testing the functionality of defining a multiline function within a `marimo` application. It defines a simple function `one` that takes multiple parameters, performs a basic arithmetic operation, and returns the result. The script is designed to be executed as a standalone application using `marimo`.

## Code Structure
The main components of the code are the `marimo` application instance and the function `one` decorated with `@app.cell`. The `marimo` library is used to create an application, and the `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within this application. The function `one` is the primary focus of this test, and it is executed when the application runs.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which represents the application being created and run. It is used to define and manage the cells within the application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a cell within the `marimo` application. This allows the function to be executed as part of the application's workflow.

### `one`
#### Description
The function `one` is defined as a cell within the `marimo` application. It takes four parameters, performs an arithmetic operation, and returns the result as a tuple.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| a | int | The first integer input. |
| b | int | The second integer input. |
| c | int | The third integer input. |
| d | int | The fourth integer input. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| x | tuple | A tuple containing the sum of the inputs. |

#### Internal Logic
The function initializes a variable `x` to zero and then adds the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` to it. The result is returned as a tuple.

## Side Effects
There are no notable side effects in this code. The function `one` simply performs a calculation and returns the result.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Used to create and manage the application and its cells. |

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration options or settings defined in this code.

## Error Handling
The code does not implement any specific error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the inputs to the function `one` are valid integers.

## Logging
The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The code does not explicitly define an API or public interface.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
