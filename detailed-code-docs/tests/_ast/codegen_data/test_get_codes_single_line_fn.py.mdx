## High-level description

The target file is a test script that uses the `marimo` library to define a simple application with a single cell function. This function takes two integer inputs, adds them, prints the result, and returns it. The script is designed to be executed as a standalone application, running the defined function when executed.

## Code Structure

The code consists of a few key components:
- The `marimo` library is imported and used to create an application instance.
- A single cell function `one` is defined using the `@app.cell` decorator, which is a feature of the `marimo` library to define executable units within the application.
- The script includes a main execution block that runs the application when the script is executed directly.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to manage the lifecycle and execution of the application. It serves as the main entry point for defining and running the application.

### `one`
#### Description
The `one` function is a cell function defined within the `marimo` application. It takes two integer arguments, adds them, prints the result, and returns the result as a tuple.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| a | int | The first integer to be added. |
| b | int | The second integer to be added. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| c | tuple | A tuple containing the sum of `a` and `b`. |

#### Internal Logic
The function performs the following steps:
1. Adds the two input integers `a` and `b`.
2. Prints the result of the addition.
3. Returns the result as a single-element tuple.

### `__generated_with`
#### Description
A string variable indicating the version of the tool or library used to generate the code, set to '0.1.0'.

## Side Effects
- The function `one` prints the result of the addition to the standard output.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Used to create and manage the application and its cell functions. |

## Error Handling
The code does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the inputs to the function `one` are valid integers.

## Logging
The code does not implement any logging mechanisms beyond the standard output print statement in the `one` function.

## API/Interface Reference
The code does not explicitly define an API or public interface beyond the `one` function, which is exposed as a cell in the `marimo` application.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
