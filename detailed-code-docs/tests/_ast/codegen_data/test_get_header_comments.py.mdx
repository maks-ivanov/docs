## High-level description

The target file `test_get_header_comments.py` is a test script that appears to be part of a testing suite for the `marimo` library. It defines a simple application using the `marimo` framework, with two cells (`one` and `two`) that are registered to the application. The script is designed to be executed as a standalone program, running the `marimo` application when executed directly.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the `marimo` library, which is used to create and run an application. The main components are:
- The `marimo.App` instance, which serves as the application container.
- Two functions (`one` and `two`) decorated with `@app.cell`, indicating they are part of the application's logic.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which acts as the main application object. It is used to register functions as cells and to run the application.

#### Inputs
No direct inputs; it is instantiated from the `marimo` library.

#### Outputs
No direct outputs; it serves as a container for the application logic.

### `one`
#### Description
`one` is a function registered as a cell in the `marimo` application. It is a placeholder function that does nothing and returns immediately.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

### `two`
#### Description
`two` is another function registered as a cell in the `marimo` application. Like `one`, it is a placeholder function that does nothing and returns immediately.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

## Side Effects

- The script registers two functions (`one` and `two`) as cells in the `marimo` application.
- When executed as a standalone script, it runs the `marimo` application.
