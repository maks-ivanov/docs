## High-level description
The target file `test_get_codes_messy.py` is a test script that uses the `marimo` library to define a simple application with a single cell function. This function takes four integer inputs, sums them, and returns the result. The script is designed to be executed as a standalone application using the `marimo` framework.

## Code Structure
The main components of the code are the `marimo.App` instance and the decorated function `__`. The `marimo.App` instance is used to create an application, and the `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell function within this application. The function `__` is the core logic of the script, performing a simple arithmetic operation.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to create and manage the application. It provides the functionality to define cell functions and run the application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell function within the `marimo` application. It registers the decorated function as a part of the application, allowing it to be executed when the application runs.

### `__`
#### Description
The function `__` is a cell function that takes four integer inputs, sums them, and returns the result as a tuple.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| a | int | The first integer input. |
| b | int | The second integer input. |
| c | int | The third integer input. |
| d | int | The fourth integer input. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| x | tuple | A tuple containing the sum of the inputs. |

#### Internal Logic
The function initializes a variable `x` to the sum of the inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. It then returns `x` as a tuple.

## Side Effects
There are no notable side effects in this code. The function simply performs a calculation and returns the result.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Used to create and manage the application and define cell functions. |

## Error Handling
The code does not implement any specific error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the inputs are valid integers.

## Logging
The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The code does not explicitly define an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone script.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
