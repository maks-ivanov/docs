## High-level description

The directory contains test scripts that utilize the `marimo` library to create simple interactive applications. These scripts demonstrate the use of `marimo`'s cell-based approach to build applications with user interface elements like number inputs and dropdown menus. The primary focus is on creating and managing interactive UI components and executing application logic in a structured, sequential manner.

## What does it do?

The scripts in this directory are designed to showcase the capabilities of the `marimo` library in building interactive applications. They provide examples of how to create user interfaces with input fields and dropdown menus, allowing users to interact with the application and see immediate results.

1. **Calculator Application**: 
   - This script allows users to input two numbers within a specified range and calculates their sum. It uses `marimo`'s cell-based approach to structure the application, with each cell representing a step in the workflow. The user inputs numbers through interactive UI elements, and the application computes and displays the sum.

2. **Dropdown UI Element**:
   - This script demonstrates the creation of a dropdown menu with predefined options. It sets up a simple application where users can select an option from the dropdown, and the application displays the selected value. The script is structured using `marimo`'s cell-based approach, with each cell performing a specific task in the application setup.

## Entry points

The main files in this directory are:

- `calculator.py`: This file serves as an entry point for a simple calculator application that takes two numbers as input and calculates their sum. It is structured using `marimo`'s cell-based approach, with each cell representing a step in the application workflow.

- `ui_element_dropdown.py`: This file is an entry point for a test script that creates a dropdown UI element. It demonstrates how to set up and display a dropdown menu with predefined options using the `marimo` library.

## Dependencies

The primary dependency for the scripts in this directory is the `marimo` library. This library is used to create and manage interactive applications, providing UI components and a structured approach to application development. The specific version of `marimo` used in the dropdown script is indicated as "0.6.22".
