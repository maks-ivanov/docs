## High-level description

The target file `tests/_ast/app_data/ui_element_dropdown.py` is a test script that utilizes the `marimo` library to create a simple application with a dropdown UI element. The script defines a series of cells using the `@app.cell` decorator, which are executed in sequence to set up and display a dropdown menu with predefined options. The application is then run using `app.run()`.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the `marimo` library, which is used to create and manage the application and its UI elements. The main components are the `app` object, which represents the application, and the `@app.cell` decorator, which is used to define executable cells within the application. Each cell performs a specific task, such as importing modules, creating UI elements, or displaying values.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
The `app` symbol is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which represents the application being created. It is initialized with a width parameter set to "medium".

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| width | str | The width of the application, set to "medium". |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| app | marimo.App | The application instance. |

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the application. Each cell is a function that performs a specific task, such as importing modules, creating UI elements, or displaying values. The cells are executed in the order they are defined.

#### Internal Logic
- The first cell imports the `marimo` module and returns it.
- The second cell creates a dropdown UI element with options "first" and "second", and a default value of "first".
- The third cell simply returns the dropdown element.
- The fourth cell constructs a string indicating the current value of the dropdown but does not return it.

### `__generated_with`
#### Description
A string indicating the version of the tool or library used to generate the script, set to "0.6.22".

## Side Effects

- The script creates a dropdown UI element and displays it within the application.
- The application is run when the script is executed as the main module.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Used to create and manage the application and its UI elements. |

## Error Handling

The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It relies on the `marimo` library to manage any errors that may occur during the execution of the application.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is a standalone test script intended to be run as a main module.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
