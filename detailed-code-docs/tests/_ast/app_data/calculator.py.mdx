## High-level description

The target file `calculator.py` is a script that uses the `marimo` library to create a simple interactive application. This application allows users to input two numbers within a specified range and then calculates their sum. The script is structured using `marimo`'s cell-based approach, which is similar to a notebook-style execution.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into several `@app.cell` functions, each representing a step in the application. These cells are executed in sequence, and they pass data between each other. The main symbols in the code are the `marimo.App` instance and the `@app.cell` decorator, which is used to define the cells of the application.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which is used to create and manage the interactive application. It serves as the main entry point for defining the application's behavior and running it.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a cell in the `marimo` application. Each cell can perform computations, interact with the user interface, and pass data to subsequent cells.

### `__()`
#### Description
This is a series of functions defined as cells in the application. Each function is decorated with `@app.cell` and performs a specific task in the application workflow.

#### Inputs and Outputs
- The first cell imports the `marimo` library and returns it for use in subsequent cells.
- The second cell uses `marimo.ui.number` to create a user interface element for inputting a number between 1 and 10, and returns this number.
- The third cell takes the number `x` and simply returns it, serving as a placeholder.
- The fourth cell is similar to the second cell but for a second number `y`.
- The fifth cell takes the number `y` and returns it, also serving as a placeholder.
- The final cell takes both numbers `x` and `y`, calculates their sum, and returns it.

#### Internal Logic
- The cells are executed in sequence, with each cell's output being passed as input to the next cell.
- The use of `marimo.ui.number` creates interactive number input fields for the user.
- The final cell performs the addition of the two numbers and returns the result.

## Side Effects

- The script creates an interactive user interface using the `marimo` library, which allows users to input numbers and see the result of their addition.
- The application runs in a loop when executed, waiting for user input and updating the interface accordingly.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Used to create and manage the interactive application, providing UI components and application structure. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors. It relies on the `marimo` library to manage any issues related to user input or UI rendering.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface beyond the interactive UI created by the `marimo` library.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
