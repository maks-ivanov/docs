## High-level description

The target file `named_cells.py` is a test script that uses the `marimo` library to define a series of computational cells within an application. Each cell is a function decorated with `@app.cell`, which allows the `marimo` framework to manage the execution and dependencies of these functions. The script defines three cells (`f`, `g`, and `h`) that perform simple arithmetic operations and demonstrates how these cells can be executed within the `marimo` application framework.

## Code Structure

- The script imports the `marimo` library and initializes an application instance using `marimo.App()`.
- Three functions (`f`, `g`, and `h`) are defined and decorated with `@app.cell`, indicating that they are computational cells managed by the `marimo` framework.
- Each function performs a simple arithmetic operation and returns a tuple containing the result.
- The script includes a main block that runs the application when executed as a standalone script.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object for managing and executing the defined cells.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to register a function as a computational cell within the `marimo` application. This allows the framework to manage the function's execution and dependencies.

### `f`
#### Description
The function `f` is a computational cell that initializes a variable `x` to 0 and returns it as a tuple.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | tuple | A tuple containing the integer 0. |

### `g`
#### Description
The function `g` is a computational cell that takes an integer `x` as input, increments it by 1, and returns the result as a tuple.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| x | int | An integer input to be incremented. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | tuple | A tuple containing the incremented integer. |

### `h`
#### Description
The function `h` is a computational cell that takes an integer `y` as input, increments it by 1, and returns the result as a tuple.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| y | int | An integer input to be incremented. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | tuple | A tuple containing the incremented integer. |

## References

- The `marimo` library is referenced for creating the application and defining cells.
- The `App` class from `marimo` is used to instantiate the application object.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Provides the framework for defining and managing computational cells within an application. |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors. However, the `marimo` framework may have its own mechanisms for managing errors during cell execution.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone script to demonstrate the use of the `marimo` framework.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
