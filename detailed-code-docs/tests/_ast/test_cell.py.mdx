## High-level description

The target file `tests/_ast/test_cell.py` contains a suite of unit tests for the `App` class and its associated functionality within the Marimo framework. These tests focus on verifying the behavior of cells, which are essentially functions that can be executed within the context of an `App`. The tests cover various scenarios, including basic cell execution, asynchronous cell execution, handling of unknown references, and the chaining of cell dependencies.

## Code Structure

The main class in this file is `TestCellRun`, which contains several static methods, each representing a test case. These methods test different aspects of the `App` and its cells, such as synchronous and asynchronous execution, reference handling, and error conditions. The `App` class from the `marimo._ast.app` module is a central component in these tests, as it provides the context in which cells are defined and executed.

## References

- `App`: The `App` class from the `marimo._ast.app` module is extensively used in this test suite. It is responsible for managing cells and executing them.
- `pytest`: The `pytest` framework is used for writing and executing the tests, particularly for handling exceptions and assertions.

## Symbols

### `TestCellRun`
#### Description
The `TestCellRun` class contains static methods that serve as test cases for the `App` class and its cell execution capabilities. Each method tests a specific aspect of cell behavior, such as basic execution, asynchronous execution, and error handling.

#### Methods

- **`test_cell_basic`**: Tests the basic functionality of a cell, ensuring it executes correctly and returns the expected output and defined variables.
- **`test_async_cell_basic`**: Tests the execution of an asynchronous cell, verifying that it handles `await` operations and returns the correct output.
- **`test_unknown_ref_raises`**: Ensures that running a cell with an unexpected argument raises a `ValueError`.
- **`test_substituted_ref_basic`**: Tests the substitution of cell references and verifies the correct execution of dependent cells.
- **`test_substituted_ref_chain`**: Tests a chain of cell dependencies, ensuring correct execution and error handling for unexpected arguments.
- **`test_async_parent`**: Verifies that a cell depending on an asynchronous parent is also treated as asynchronous.
- **`test_async_chain`**: Tests a chain of asynchronous cells, ensuring each cell is correctly identified as a coroutine.
- **`test_empty_cell`**: Tests the execution of an empty cell, ensuring it returns the expected output.
- **`test_conditional_def`**: Tests a cell with a conditional definition, verifying that undefined variables at runtime are handled correctly.
- **`test_import`**: Tests the import and execution of cells from an external module, verifying their names and outputs.

#### Inputs and Outputs
Each test method typically takes no inputs and uses assertions to verify the expected outputs or behaviors of the cells within the `App`.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `pytest` | Used for writing and executing the test cases. |
| `marimo._ast.app.App` | The class under test, providing the context for cell execution. |

## Error Handling

The test methods use `pytest.raises` to verify that certain operations raise expected exceptions, such as `ValueError` when an unexpected argument is passed to a cell.

## Logging

There is no explicit logging in the test file itself, but the `App` class may have its own logging mechanisms as part of its implementation.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
