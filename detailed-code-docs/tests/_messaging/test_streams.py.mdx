## High-level description

The target file `test_streams.py` contains a suite of asynchronous unit tests designed to verify the functionality of standard input, output, and error streams within a mocked kernel environment. These tests ensure that the mocked kernel's stream handling behaves as expected, particularly in terms of encoding, input handling, and output capturing. The tests are part of a larger testing framework for the Marimo runtime, which is a system for managing and executing code cells in a notebook-like environment.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into three main classes, each responsible for testing a different standard stream: `TestStdin`, `TestStdout`, and `TestStderr`. Each class contains several static asynchronous methods that perform specific tests on the corresponding stream. The tests utilize a mocked kernel and execution request provider to simulate the execution of code and verify the behavior of the streams.

## Symbols

### `TestStdin`
#### Description
This class contains tests for verifying the behavior of the standard input (`stdin`) stream in the mocked kernel environment.

#### Methods

- **`test_encoding`**: Verifies that the encoding of the mocked kernel's `stdin` matches the system's `stdin` encoding.
- **`test_input_installed`**: Checks if the `input` function is correctly installed and functional within the kernel.
- **`test_readline_installed`**: Ensures that the `readline` method of `stdin` is installed and returns the expected output.
- **`test_readlines_installed`**: Verifies that the `readlines` method of `stdin` is installed and returns the expected output.

### `TestStdout`
#### Description
This class contains tests for verifying the behavior of the standard output (`stdout`) stream in the mocked kernel environment.

#### Methods

- **`test_encoding`**: Verifies that the encoding of the mocked kernel's `stdout` matches the system's `stdout` encoding.
- **`test_fileno`**: Checks if the `fileno` method of `stdout` is functional and returns a non-null value.
- **`test_print`**: Tests the `print` function to ensure it outputs the expected messages to `stdout`.
- **`test_write`**: Verifies that the `write` method of `stdout` correctly outputs a string.
- **`test_writelines`**: Ensures that the `writelines` method of `stdout` correctly outputs a list of strings.

### `TestStderr`
#### Description
This class contains tests for verifying the behavior of the standard error (`stderr`) stream in the mocked kernel environment.

#### Methods

- **`test_encoding`**: Verifies that the encoding of the mocked kernel's `stderr` matches the system's `stderr` encoding.
- **`test_fileno`**: Checks if the `fileno` method of `stderr` is functional and returns a non-null value.
- **`test_write`**: Verifies that the `write` method of `stderr` correctly outputs a string.
- **`test_writelines`**: Ensures that the `writelines` method of `stderr` correctly outputs a list of strings.

### `test_import_multiprocessing`
#### Description
This standalone test verifies that the `multiprocessing` module can be imported and used within the mocked kernel environment without causing issues.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `sys` | Used to access system-level input/output streams for comparison. |
| `marimo._runtime.runtime.Kernel` | Provides the kernel environment for executing code cells. |
| `tests.conftest.ExecReqProvider` | Supplies execution requests for testing. |
| `tests.conftest.MockedKernel` | Provides a mocked kernel environment for testing. |

## Error Handling

The tests use assertions to verify expected outcomes. If an assertion fails, it indicates a discrepancy between the expected and actual behavior of the stream handling in the mocked kernel.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms. It relies on assertions to report test failures.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
