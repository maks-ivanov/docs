## High-level description
The target file `test_cli_config.py` contains a test function designed to verify the behavior of the `marimo` command-line interface (CLI) when displaying configuration settings. It uses the `subprocess` module to execute the CLI command and checks the output to ensure it contains expected configuration details.

## Code Structure
The file consists of a single test function, `test_config_show`, which is responsible for executing a CLI command and validating its output. This function is standalone and does not interact with other symbols within the file.

## Symbols

### `test_config_show`
#### Description
The `test_config_show` function tests the `marimo config show` command to ensure it executes successfully and outputs the expected configuration details. It checks that the command returns a zero exit code and that specific strings are present in the output, indicating the configuration is displayed correctly.

#### Inputs
This function does not take any inputs as it is a test function designed to be run in a test suite.

#### Outputs
This function does not return any outputs. Instead, it uses assertions to validate the behavior of the CLI command.

#### Internal Logic
1. The function uses `subprocess.run` to execute the `marimo config show` command.
2. It captures the command's output and error streams.
3. It asserts that the command's return code is zero, indicating successful execution.
4. It decodes the standard output and checks for the presence of specific strings ("User config from" and "[formatting]") to verify that the configuration details are correctly displayed.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `subprocess` | Used to execute the CLI command and capture its output and error streams. |

## Error Handling
The function uses assertions to handle errors. If the command does not execute successfully (i.e., the return code is not zero), or if the expected strings are not found in the output, the test will fail, providing diagnostic information through the assertion messages.

## Logging
There is no explicit logging in this code. The function relies on assertions to provide feedback during test execution.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
