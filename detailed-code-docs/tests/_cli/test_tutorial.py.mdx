## High-level description

The target file `tests/_cli/test_tutorial.py` is a test script designed to verify that all tutorials defined in the `marimo` package are accessible and can be parsed correctly. It does this by iterating over a predefined list of tutorial names and checking that the source code or content for each tutorial can be retrieved without errors.

## Code Structure

The main function in this file is `test_tutorial_source`, which relies on two key components from the `marimo._tutorials` module: `get_tutorial_source` and `tutorial_order`. The `tutorial_order` is a list of tutorial identifiers, and `get_tutorial_source` is a function that retrieves the source content for a given tutorial.

## References

- `get_tutorial_source`: A function from the `marimo._tutorials` module that retrieves the source code or content of a tutorial based on its name.
- `tutorial_order`: A list from the `marimo._tutorials` module that specifies the order and names of tutorials to be tested.

## Symbols

### `test_tutorial_source`
#### Description
The `test_tutorial_source` function is a test case that ensures each tutorial listed in `tutorial_order` can be accessed and its source content retrieved successfully. It uses assertions to verify that the content is not empty.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- The function iterates over each tutorial name in the `tutorial_order` list.
- For each tutorial, it calls `get_tutorial_source` to retrieve the source content.
- It asserts that the retrieved source content is not empty, ensuring that the tutorial is accessible and correctly parsed.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo._tutorials` | Provides the `get_tutorial_source` function and `tutorial_order` list used to retrieve and verify tutorial content. |

## Error Handling

The function uses assertions to handle errors. If a tutorial's source content cannot be retrieved (i.e., if it is empty or the retrieval fails), the assertion will raise an error, indicating a problem with accessing the tutorial.

## Logging

There is no explicit logging in this test script. Errors are handled through assertions, which will raise exceptions if a test fails.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
