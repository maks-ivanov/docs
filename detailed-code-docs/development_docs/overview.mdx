## High-level description

The `development_docs` directory provides documentation and instructions for integrating and working with specific tools and technologies within the project. It includes guidance on using OpenAPI for API schema management and Pyodide for running the frontend against different backend environments. These documents are intended to assist developers in setting up and maintaining the development environment efficiently.

## What does it do?

The `development_docs` directory offers step-by-step instructions for developers to perform specific tasks related to OpenAPI and Pyodide:

- **OpenAPI**: The documentation provides commands to print, write, validate, and generate clients from an OpenAPI schema. This helps in managing API specifications and ensuring they are correctly defined and utilized within the project.

- **Pyodide**: The documentation outlines how to run the frontend of the application against the latest deployment on PyPi or a local backend. This is useful for testing and development purposes, allowing developers to see how the frontend interacts with different versions of the backend.

## Key Files

### OpenAPI Documentation (`openapi.md`)

- **Printing the OpenAPI schema**: Provides a command to output the current OpenAPI schema, which is useful for reviewing or sharing the API structure.

- **Writing a new OpenAPI schema**: Offers a command to save the current OpenAPI schema to a file, facilitating version control and documentation.

- **Validating an OpenAPI schema**: Describes how to use the `openapi-spec-validator` to ensure the schema is correctly formatted and adheres to OpenAPI standards.

- **Generating a client from an OpenAPI schema**: Explains how to use a `make` command to generate client code from the OpenAPI schema, which can be used to interact with the API programmatically.

### Pyodide Documentation (`pyodide.md`)

- **Running the frontend against the latest deploy on PyPi**: Provides instructions for setting up the frontend to work with the latest backend deployment available on PyPi, using the `pnpm` package manager.

- **Running the frontend against a local backend**: Details the steps to build the project, serve it locally, and watch for changes using `watchdog`. This setup is useful for local development and testing, ensuring that changes are immediately reflected in the running application.
