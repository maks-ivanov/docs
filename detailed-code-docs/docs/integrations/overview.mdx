## High-level description

The `docs/integrations` directory provides documentation and examples for integrating various Google Cloud services with the `marimo` platform. It includes detailed guides on how to set up and authenticate connections to Google Cloud BigQuery, Google Cloud Storage, and Google Sheets. Each integration guide explains the necessary steps to install required Python packages, authenticate using Google Cloud's recommended methods, and read data from these services using Python code.

## What does it do?

The documentation in this directory serves as a guide for users who want to connect their `marimo` applications to Google Cloud services. It provides step-by-step instructions on how to:

1. **Install Required Packages**: Each guide specifies the Python packages needed to interact with the respective Google Cloud service. For example, `google-cloud-bigquery` for BigQuery, `google-cloud-storage` for Cloud Storage, and `gspread` for Google Sheets.

2. **Authenticate**: The guides explain how to authenticate using Google Cloud's Application Default Credentials or a service account key file. This ensures secure access to the user's Google Cloud resources.

3. **Read Data**: Each guide includes Python code snippets that demonstrate how to read data from the respective service. For instance, using a `BigQueryClient` to fetch datasets and tables from BigQuery, a `StorageClient` to list buckets and files in Cloud Storage, and a `gspread.Client` to access Google Sheets.

4. **Run Examples**: Users are provided with links to full example scripts hosted on GitHub, which they can run directly to see the integration in action.

Overall, these guides help users seamlessly connect their `marimo` applications to Google Cloud services, enabling them to leverage cloud-based data storage and processing capabilities.

## Entry points
