## High-level description

The `docs/helpers` directory contains a collection of Python scripts designed to enhance the Sphinx documentation generation process. These scripts provide custom directives and utilities to integrate and format content within the documentation. The main components include:

- **`copy_readme.py`**: Defines a directive to extract and include specific sections from a `README.md` file into the documentation.
- **`marimo_embed.py`**: Provides a directive to embed Marimo applications directly into documentation pages using HTML iframes.
- **`md2rst.py`**: Contains a function to convert markdown-formatted docstrings into reStructuredText (RST) format using the `pypandoc` library.
- **`sections.py`**: Implements a class to filter and categorize public methods for documentation purposes, excluding private and special methods.

## What does it do?

The scripts in this directory collectively enhance the documentation process by providing tools to integrate and format content more effectively:

- **Extracting README Sections**: The `copy_readme.py` script allows specific sections of a `README.md` file to be extracted and included in the documentation. This is useful for maintaining consistency between the README and the documentation without duplicating content.

- **Embedding Applications**: The `marimo_embed.py` script enables the embedding of Marimo applications within documentation pages. This is done by generating an HTML iframe that loads the application with specified configurations, such as size and mode.

- **Converting Markdown to RST**: The `md2rst.py` script automatically converts markdown-formatted docstrings to RST during the documentation build process. This ensures that markdown content is properly formatted for Sphinx, which primarily uses RST.

- **Categorizing Public Methods**: The `sections.py` script provides a mechanism to filter and categorize public methods in class documentation, excluding private and special methods. This helps in focusing the documentation on the public API of classes.

## Entry points

The main files in this directory are organized to provide specific functionalities:

- **`copy_readme.py`**: The entry point for extracting and including sections from a `README.md` file into the documentation.
- **`marimo_embed.py`**: The entry point for embedding Marimo applications within documentation pages.
- **`md2rst.py`**: The entry point for converting markdown docstrings to RST format during the documentation build process.
- **`sections.py`**: The entry point for categorizing public methods in class documentation.

## Dependencies

The directory relies on several external libraries to perform its functions:

- **`docutils.parsers.rst`**: Used for creating custom Sphinx directives.
- **`myst_parser.docutils_`**: Provides tools for parsing markdown content for Sphinx documentation.
- **`pypandoc`**: Utilized for converting markdown text to reStructuredText using Pandoc.
- **`autoclasstoc`**: Offers utilities for defining and filtering sections of documentation, particularly for class methods.
- **`urllib.parse`**: Used for URL-encoding content to be embedded in iframes.

These dependencies are chosen to leverage existing tools and libraries for documentation generation and content manipulation, ensuring compatibility and ease of integration with Sphinx.
