title: "babel.config.js"
---

## High-level description
This file, `babel.config.js`, is a configuration file for Babel, a popular JavaScript compiler. It sets up the Babel preset specifically for use with Docusaurus, a static site generator often used for creating documentation websites.

## Symbols

### `module.exports`
#### Description
This is the main export of the configuration file. It defines an object that specifies the Babel configuration for the project.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| config | Object | The Babel configuration object |

#### Internal Logic
The configuration object contains a single property `presets`, which is an array with one element. This element is the result of resolving the path to the Docusaurus Babel preset.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @docusaurus/core | Provides the Babel preset for Docusaurus |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| presets | Array | [`@docusaurus/core/lib/babel/preset`] | Specifies the Babel presets to be used |

## Notes
1. This configuration file is using CommonJS module syntax (`module.exports`) rather than ES6 module syntax (`export default`).
2. The `require.resolve()` function is used to get the absolute path of the Docusaurus Babel preset. This ensures that the correct preset is loaded regardless of the current working directory.
3. The Docusaurus Babel preset likely includes a set of plugins and configuration options optimized for use with Docusaurus projects.
4. This configuration is minimal and relies entirely on the Docusaurus preset for its Babel settings. Any additional customization would need to be added to this file or handled by the Docusaurus preset itself.
