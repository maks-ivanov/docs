## High-level description

The `docs/api/media` directory provides documentation for embedding various types of media using the `marimo` library. It includes guides and examples for embedding audio, video, images, PDFs, downloadable files, and plain text into applications. The documentation is structured to help developers understand how to use the `marimo` library's functions to handle different media types effectively.

## What does it do?

The documentation in this directory explains how to use the `marimo` library to embed different types of media into applications. Each media type has its own dedicated documentation file that provides examples and usage instructions. For instance, you can embed an audio file by providing a URL to the audio source, or you can allow users to download a text file by specifying the file's content and metadata. The documentation also covers embedding images, videos, PDFs, and plain text, demonstrating how to use the library's functions to achieve these tasks.

## Entry points

The main entry point for this directory is the `index.md` file, which serves as a table of contents for the media documentation. It links to individual documentation files for each media type, such as `audio.md`, `video.md`, `image.md`, `pdf.md`, `download.md`, and `plain_text.md`. Each of these files provides detailed instructions and examples for using the corresponding `marimo` function to embed that type of media.

## Key Files

- **audio.md**: Documents how to embed audio files using the `marimo.audio` function. It includes an example of embedding an audio file from a URL.
  
- **download.md**: Explains how to create downloadable files using the `marimo.download` function. It provides an example of creating a downloadable text file.

- **image.md**: Describes how to embed images using the `marimo.image` function, with an example of embedding an image from a URL and customizing its appearance.

- **video.md**: Covers embedding video files using the `marimo.video` function, including an example of embedding a video from a URL.

- **pdf.md**: Provides documentation for embedding PDF files using the `marimo.pdf` function.

- **plain_text.md**: Details how to embed plain text using the `marimo.plain_text` function.

Each of these files uses the `marimo-embed` directive to demonstrate the functionality of the `marimo` library, making it easier for developers to understand how to implement media embedding in their applications.
