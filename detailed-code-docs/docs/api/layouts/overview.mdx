## High-level description

The `docs/api/layouts` directory provides documentation for various layout components available in the Marimo framework. These components are designed to help developers arrange and organize UI elements in a structured manner. The directory includes documentation for different layout types such as accordions, carousels, callouts, and more. Each layout type is documented with examples and usage instructions, showcasing how to implement and utilize these components within a Marimo application.

## What does it do?

The documentation in this directory explains how to use Marimo's layout components to create organized and interactive user interfaces. Each layout component serves a specific purpose:

- **Accordion**: Allows content to be displayed in collapsible sections, where users can expand or collapse sections to view or hide content.
- **Callout**: Highlights important information with a distinct visual style, often used to draw attention to warnings, success messages, or neutral information.
- **Carousel**: Displays a series of content items that users can navigate through, often used for showcasing images or slides.
- **Justify**: Provides alignment options for content, allowing elements to be aligned to the left, center, or right.
- **Lazy**: Defers the loading of content until it is needed, improving performance by loading content on demand.
- **Plain**: Offers a simple layout without additional styling or structure.
- **Routes**: Manages navigation within an application, allowing different content to be displayed based on the current route or URL.
- **Sidebar**: Creates a vertical navigation menu, often used for site navigation or to provide quick access to different sections of an application.
- **Stacks**: Arranges elements in a horizontal or vertical stack, with options for alignment, spacing, and wrapping.
- **Tree**: Displays hierarchical data in a tree structure, allowing users to expand or collapse nodes to explore nested content.

Each component is demonstrated with code examples, showing how to integrate them into a Marimo application and customize their behavior and appearance.

## Entry points
