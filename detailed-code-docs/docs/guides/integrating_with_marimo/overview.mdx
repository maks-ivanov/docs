## High-level description

The `integrating_with_marimo` directory within the documentation guides users on how to integrate their custom objects and UI plugins with the Marimo framework. Marimo is a platform that allows for the creation of interactive and rich user interfaces, particularly in the context of data visualization and manipulation. This directory contains guides that help developers leverage Marimo's capabilities to enhance the display of objects and create custom UI components.

## What does it do?

The guides in this directory provide instructions on how to integrate custom objects and UI plugins with Marimo. Specifically, they cover:

1. **Displaying Objects**: This guide explains how to use Marimo's media viewer to display objects with rich representations. It provides two main methods for achieving this:
   - Implementing a `_mime_` method in your object classes, which returns a MIME type and the data to be displayed. This allows Marimo to render the object in a rich format, such as JSON, HTML, or images.
   - Registering custom formatters within the Marimo codebase for objects where you cannot modify the class to include a `_mime_` method.

2. **Custom UI Plugins**: This guide is intended to help developers create custom UI plugins that integrate with Marimo's reactive execution engine. This allows for the development of interactive UI components that can respond to user inputs and other events within a Marimo application.

## Entry points

The main entry point for this directory is the `index.md` file, which serves as an overview and provides links to the specific guides on displaying objects and creating custom UI plugins. This file also includes tips for checking if the code is running within a Marimo notebook, which can be useful for developers integrating their libraries with Marimo.

## Key Files

- **`displaying_objects.md`**: This file provides detailed instructions on how to display objects with rich representations in Marimo. It includes examples of implementing the `_mime_` method and registering custom formatters.
  
- **`custom_ui_plugins.md`**: This file guides developers on building custom UI plugins that can hook into Marimo's reactive execution engine, allowing for the creation of dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

## Dependencies

The guides reference the use of Marimo's built-in capabilities and its media viewer for rendering objects. They also mention the use of external libraries like matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly, and altair for data visualization, which can be integrated with Marimo to enhance the display of data.

## Configuration

The documentation provides a tip on checking if the code is running in a Marimo notebook using the `mo.running_in_notebook` function. This can be useful for developers who need to conditionally execute code based on the environment in which it is running.
