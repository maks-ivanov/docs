## High-level description

The `best_practices` directory within the documentation provides guidelines and recommendations for writing efficient and maintainable marimo notebooks. It includes best practices for code organization, naming conventions, and performance optimization. The directory is structured to offer both general best practices and specific performance tips, helping developers write cleaner and more efficient code.

## What does it do?

The `best_practices` directory serves as a guide for developers using marimo notebooks, offering advice on how to write code that is both efficient and easy to maintain. It emphasizes the importance of minimizing global variables, using descriptive names, encapsulating logic in functions, and avoiding unnecessary mutations. Additionally, it provides performance tips such as caching computations, disabling expensive cells, and lazy-loading elements to optimize the execution of notebooks.

### Best Practices

- **Global Variables**: Use them sparingly to avoid name collisions. Encapsulate intermediate variables within functions or prefix them with an underscore to keep them local to a cell.
- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear and descriptive names for variables, especially global ones, to minimize name clashes and improve code readability.
- **Functions**: Encapsulate logic into functions to prevent pollution of the global namespace and avoid code duplication.
- **Python Modules**: Split complex logic into helper modules if the notebook becomes too lengthy.
- **Minimize Mutations**: Avoid splitting declarations and mutations across multiple cells. Instead, declare and mutate in the same cell or create new variables based on old ones.
- **Idempotent Cells**: Write cells that produce the same output when given the same input to avoid bugs and cache expensive computations.

### Performance

- **Caching**: Use Python's `functools.cache` to store results of expensive computations, avoiding redundant calculations.
- **Disable Expensive Cells**: Temporarily disable cells from running automatically to edit parts of a notebook without triggering other executions.
- **Disable Notebook Autorun**: For expensive notebooks, disable autorun to prevent automatic execution.
- **Lazy-loading**: Use `marimo.lazy` to defer the rendering of expensive UI elements or computations until they are needed, optimizing resource usage.

These practices and performance tips are designed to help developers create marimo notebooks that are both efficient and easy to maintain, ensuring a smoother development process and better performance.
