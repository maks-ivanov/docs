## High-level description

The `docs/guides/deploying` directory provides comprehensive documentation on deploying marimo applications. It includes guides on various deployment methods, such as using Docker, Marimo Cloud, Ploomber Cloud, and deploying to a public gallery. Additionally, it covers authentication mechanisms and how to run the marimo backend programmatically. The directory is structured to help users understand different deployment strategies and configurations for marimo notebooks and applications.

## What does it do?

The documentation in this directory guides users through the process of deploying marimo applications in different environments. It explains how to secure applications with authentication, deploy using Docker for containerization, and utilize cloud services like Marimo Cloud and Ploomber Cloud for scalable and secure deployments. The guides also cover how to share applications publicly and run the marimo backend programmatically for customization. This enables users to choose the most suitable deployment method for their needs, whether for local testing, public sharing, or production environments.

## Entry points

The main files in this directory are:

- **`index.md`**: Serves as the central hub for deployment guides, linking to various deployment methods and providing an overview of available options.
- **`authentication.md`**: Details how to implement authentication in marimo applications, including enabling basic authentication and adding custom authentication systems.
- **`deploying_docker.md`**: Provides instructions for deploying marimo applications using Docker, including creating a Dockerfile and running the application locally.
- **`deploying_marimo_cloud.md`**: Explains how to deploy applications to Marimo Cloud, highlighting its features and benefits.
- **`deploying_ploomber.md`**: Offers guidance on deploying to Ploomber Cloud for secure and scalable production deployments.
- **`deploying_public_gallery.md`**: Describes how to deploy applications to a public gallery for sharing with a wider audience.
- **`programmatically.md`**: Shows how to run the marimo backend programmatically using FastAPI, allowing for customization and integration into larger applications.

## Key Files

- **`authentication.md`**: This file is crucial for understanding how to secure marimo applications. It explains the default authentication setup and how to customize it using ASGI middleware.
- **`deploying_docker.md`**: Essential for users looking to containerize their applications, this file provides a step-by-step guide to creating a Docker image and running it locally.
- **`deploying_marimo_cloud.md`**: Important for users interested in leveraging Marimo Cloud for deployment, offering insights into its features and how to get started.
- **`programmatically.md`**: Key for developers who want to integrate marimo into larger systems, providing an example of running marimo with FastAPI.

## Dependencies

The deployment guides mention the use of external libraries and frameworks such as:

- **FastAPI**: Used for running the marimo backend programmatically, chosen for its simplicity and performance in building web applications.
- **Docker**: Utilized for containerizing applications, providing a consistent environment for deployment across different platforms.
- **Uvicorn**: A lightweight ASGI server used in the FastAPI example for running the application.

These dependencies are chosen for their ability to facilitate efficient and scalable deployment of marimo applications.
