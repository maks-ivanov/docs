## High-level description

The `docs/guides` directory provides comprehensive documentation for users and developers working with the marimo platform. Marimo is a tool designed to enhance productivity in data analysis and application development by offering a reactive notebook environment. This directory includes guides on various aspects of marimo, such as running notebooks as apps, best practices, data manipulation, deployment, editor features, exporting, interactivity, plotting, reactivity, and more. The documentation is structured to help users understand and leverage marimo's capabilities effectively, whether they are transitioning from Jupyter, deploying applications, or integrating custom plugins.

## What does it do?

The guides in this directory serve multiple purposes:

- **Running Notebooks as Apps**: Users can run notebooks as interactive web applications using the marimo CLI. This feature allows for the creation of apps with customizable layouts, including vertical, grid, and slides layouts.

- **Best Practices**: Provides guidelines for writing efficient and maintainable marimo notebooks, emphasizing code organization, naming conventions, and performance optimization.

- **Data Manipulation**: Offers tools for displaying, selecting, and transforming dataframes interactively, with native support for Pandas and Polars.

- **Deployment**: Guides users through deploying marimo applications using various methods, including Docker, Marimo Cloud, and Ploomber Cloud, with a focus on authentication and scalability.

- **Editor Features**: Describes the functionalities of the marimo editor, including AI-assisted code completion, configuration options, hotkeys, and overview panels for efficient coding and data analysis.

- **Exporting**: Explains how to export marimo notebooks to different formats, such as HTML, Python scripts, markdown, and Jupyter notebooks, and introduces the concept of marimo islands for embedding interactive content in HTML.

- **Interactivity and Reactivity**: Details the creation of interactive UI elements and the reactive execution model that ensures code and program state consistency.

- **Plotting**: Supports major plotting libraries and introduces reactive plots that connect frontend selections to Python.

- **SQL Integration**: Allows users to mix Python and SQL within notebooks, enabling queries on dataframes, files, databases, and APIs.

- **State Management**: Introduces reactive state management for maintaining historical state, synchronizing UI elements, and introducing cycles across cells.

- **WASM Notebooks**: Provides an online playground for running marimo notebooks entirely in the browser, facilitating easy sharing and experimentation.

Overall, the guides aim to empower users to create interactive, efficient, and scalable applications and analyses using marimo.
