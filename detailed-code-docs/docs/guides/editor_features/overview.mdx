## High-level description

The `editor_features` directory within the `docs/guides` section of the codebase provides comprehensive documentation on the features available in the marimo editor, a browser-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for working with marimo notebooks. This directory includes guides on AI-assisted code completion, configuration options, and hotkeys, among other features. The marimo editor is designed to enhance productivity by offering a wide range of tools and functionalities, such as variable exploration, data inspection, smart module reloading, and integration with AI tools like GitHub Copilot and other language models.

## What does it do?

The marimo editor is a feature-rich environment that facilitates efficient coding and data analysis. It offers several key functionalities:

- **AI Completion**: The editor supports AI-assisted coding through GitHub Copilot and other AI models. This feature provides in-line code suggestions and can help refactor or complete code cells based on the context. Users can configure different AI models, such as OpenAI's GPT-4 or local models via Ollama, to assist in coding tasks.

- **Configuration**: Users can customize their editor experience through various settings, such as enabling GitHub Copilot, adjusting editor font size, toggling dark mode, and more. These settings can be accessed via the editor's settings menu.

- **Hotkeys**: The editor supports a wide range of keyboard shortcuts to streamline coding workflows. Users can customize these hotkeys to suit their preferences, enhancing their productivity by allowing quick access to common actions like running cells, formatting code, and navigating the notebook.

- **Overview Panels**: The editor includes panels for file exploration, variable inspection, data exploration, dependency graph visualization, and more. These panels provide a comprehensive view of the notebook's structure and content, aiding in efficient data analysis and code management.

- **Cell Actions and Context Menus**: Users can perform various actions on code cells, such as formatting, hiding code, and moving cells, through context menus. Right-click menus offer additional context-sensitive options for interacting with the notebook.

- **Command Palette**: A command palette is available for quick access to common commands, allowing users to perform actions without leaving the keyboard.

- **Export and Sharing**: Notebooks can be exported to static HTML for sharing or archiving. Users can also share their notebooks via an online playground that supports WebAssembly.

Overall, the marimo editor is designed to provide a seamless and efficient coding experience, leveraging AI tools and customizable features to enhance user productivity.
