## High-level description

The target file `docs/apps/output.py` is a Python script that utilizes the `marimo` library to create an interactive application with various UI elements and plots. The script defines multiple cells, each responsible for creating and managing different components of the application, such as markdown text, sliders, tables, and plots. The application is designed to be run as a standalone app using the `marimo` framework, which supports reactive execution and UI interactivity.

## Code Structure

The code is structured into several `@app.cell` decorated functions, each representing a cell in a `marimo` notebook. These cells are responsible for creating and returning UI components or performing specific tasks. The `marimo` library is used extensively to create UI elements like text inputs, sliders, tables, and plots. The cells are interconnected, with some cells depending on the outputs of others to function correctly.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
The `app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which serves as the main application object. It is used to define and manage the cells within the application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell in the `marimo` application. Each decorated function represents a cell that can perform computations, create UI elements, or manage data.

### `__generated_with`
#### Description
A string variable indicating the version of the tool used to generate the script, set to "0.0.6".

### `__()`
#### Description
Multiple functions named `__` are defined, each serving a different purpose within the application. These functions are decorated with `@app.cell` and are responsible for creating UI components, performing calculations, or managing data.

#### Inputs and Outputs
Each `__` function has different inputs and outputs, depending on its purpose. For example, some functions take UI components as inputs and return modified or new components.

#### Internal Logic
- The first `__` function takes `tabs` as input and returns it, serving as a placeholder or pass-through.
- Another `__` function creates a set of tabs using `mo.ui.tabs`, each containing different UI elements like markdown, lists, tables, and plots.
- Other `__` functions create specific UI components like text inputs, sliders, and tables, or perform plotting using `matplotlib`.

### `mo`
#### Description
`mo` is a shorthand for the `marimo` library, imported within some cells to access its UI and markdown functionalities.

### `np` and `plt`
#### Description
`np` and `plt` are shorthand imports for `numpy` and `matplotlib.pyplot`, respectively, used for numerical computations and plotting.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Used for creating the application and UI elements. |
| `numpy` | Used for numerical computations, such as generating data for plots. |
| `matplotlib.pyplot` | Used for creating plots within the application. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors beyond basic Python exception handling. The focus is on defining UI components and their interactions.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms. It is primarily focused on UI creation and interaction.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API but is designed to be run as an interactive application using the `marimo` framework. The application is executed by calling `app.run()` at the end of the script.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code. The script appears to be complete and functional as intended.
