## High-level description

The target file `docs/apps/sql.py` is a script that uses the `marimo` library to create a simple application that processes and displays data from a CSV file. It defines a series of cells that execute SQL commands to create an in-memory table from a CSV file, perform data analysis, and return the results. The script is designed to be run as a standalone application.

## Code Structure

The main components of the code are:
- The `marimo.App` instance, which serves as the application framework.
- Several `@app.cell` decorated functions, which define the logic for each cell in the application. These cells perform SQL operations, data analysis, and import necessary modules.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
An instance of `marimo.App` that serves as the main application object. It is configured with a medium width.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
A decorator used to define a cell in the `marimo` application. Each decorated function represents a cell that can execute code and return results.

### `__(mo)`
#### Description
This function is a cell that executes SQL commands to create an in-memory table from a CSV file and selects specific columns from it.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | marimo object | The `marimo` object used to execute SQL commands. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cars | DataFrame | A DataFrame containing selected columns from the CSV file. |

#### Internal Logic
- Executes a SQL command to create an in-memory table named `cars` from a CSV file located at a specified URL.
- Selects the `Make`, `Model`, `Cylinders`, `Weight`, and `MPG_City` columns from the `cars` table.

### `__(cars)`
#### Description
This function is a cell that performs basic data analysis on the `cars` DataFrame.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cars | DataFrame | The DataFrame containing car data. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | None | The function does not return any value. |

#### Internal Logic
- Calculates the length of the `cars` DataFrame.
- Computes the mean of the `MPG_City` column.

### `__()`
#### Description
This function is a cell that imports the `marimo` module and returns it.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The `marimo` module. |

## References

- The `marimo` library is used extensively throughout the code to create the application and execute SQL commands.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Used to create the application and execute SQL commands. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the SQL commands and data operations will execute successfully.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The code does not expose an API or public interface.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
