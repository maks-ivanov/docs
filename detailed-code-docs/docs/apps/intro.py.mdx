## High-level description

The target file `docs/apps/intro.py` is a script that demonstrates the use of the `marimo` library to create a reactive and interactive notebook or app. It showcases how to use `marimo` to create UI elements like sliders and accordions, and how these elements can trigger automatic execution of notebook cells when interacted with. The script is structured to introduce users to the basic concepts and functionalities of `marimo`, such as reactive execution and UI interactivity.

## Code Structure

The script is structured using the `marimo` library's `App` class, which is used to define a series of cells. Each cell is a function decorated with `@app.cell`, and these cells contain the logic for displaying markdown content, UI elements, and handling interactions. The cells are executed in a sequence that demonstrates the reactive nature of `marimo` notebooks.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
An instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object for the script. It is used to define and manage the execution of cells within the notebook.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
A decorator used to define a cell in the `marimo` notebook. Each decorated function represents a cell that can contain markdown content, UI elements, or other logic. The cells are executed in a reactive manner, meaning they automatically re-run when their inputs change.

### `__generated_with`
#### Description
A string variable indicating the version of the tool or library used to generate the script. In this case, it is set to "0.0.6".

### `__()`
#### Description
A series of functions decorated with `@app.cell`, each representing a cell in the `marimo` notebook. These functions contain the logic for displaying markdown content, creating UI elements, and handling interactions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | `marimo` object | The `marimo` object used to access UI and markdown functionalities. |
| slider | UI element | A slider UI element created in a previous cell. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| slider | UI element | A slider UI element that allows user interaction. |
| mo | `marimo` object | The `marimo` object returned for further use. |

#### Internal Logic
- The first cell displays a welcome message using markdown.
- The second cell creates a slider UI element with a range from 1 to 22.
- The third cell uses the slider's value to dynamically update markdown content, demonstrating the reactive nature of `marimo`.
- The fourth cell introduces an accordion UI element with additional information about `marimo`.
- The final cell imports the `marimo` module and returns it.

## Side Effects
- The script modifies the UI by adding interactive elements like sliders and accordions.
- It dynamically updates markdown content based on user interactions with the UI elements.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Used to create and manage reactive notebooks and UI elements. |

## Error Handling
The script does not explicitly handle errors. It relies on the `marimo` library to manage UI interactions and cell execution.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone script to demonstrate `marimo` functionalities.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
