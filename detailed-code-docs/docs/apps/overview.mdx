## High-level description

The `docs/apps` directory contains a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate the use of the `marimo` library to create interactive applications. Each script is designed to showcase different functionalities and features of `marimo`, such as UI interactivity, data visualization, and data processing. The main components within this directory include applications for embedding numbers, introducing `marimo` features, generating outputs, creating a simple UI, and processing SQL data.

## What does it do?

The scripts in this directory are designed to create interactive applications using the `marimo` framework. Here's a brief overview of what each script does:

1. **Embedding Numbers (`embedding_numbers.py`)**: This application allows users to explore embeddings of the MNIST dataset, which consists of images of handwritten digits. Users can adjust parameters like embedding dimension and constraint type to see how the embeddings change. The results are visualized using plots.

2. **Introduction to Marimo (`intro.py`)**: This script serves as an introduction to the `marimo` library, demonstrating how to create reactive and interactive notebooks. It showcases UI elements like sliders and accordions, and how these elements can trigger automatic execution of notebook cells.

3. **Output Generation (`output.py`)**: This application creates an interactive UI with various elements such as sliders, tables, and plots. It demonstrates how to use `marimo` to build complex UIs that react to user inputs and display dynamic content.

4. **Simple UI (`readme_ui.py`)**: This script creates a basic interactive application with sliders and mathematical expressions. Users can interact with sliders to see the results of calculations, such as the exponential of a slider's value.

5. **SQL Data Processing (`sql.py`)**: This application processes data from a CSV file using SQL commands. It creates an in-memory table, performs data analysis, and displays the results. The script demonstrates how to integrate SQL operations within a `marimo` application.

## Entry points

The main entry points for each application are the respective Python scripts: `embedding_numbers.py`, `intro.py`, `output.py`, `readme_ui.py`, and `sql.py`. Each script is structured around the `marimo` framework, using the `@app.cell` decorator to define interactive components and logic. The applications are executed by running the scripts, which initialize the `marimo.App` instance and define the UI and functionality through the decorated functions.

## Dependencies

The applications in this directory rely on several external libraries:

- **`marimo`**: The primary framework used to create interactive applications and UI elements. It provides the structure and functionality for building reactive notebooks and apps.
- **`matplotlib.pyplot`**: Used for plotting and visualizing data, particularly in the `embedding_numbers.py` and `output.py` scripts.
- **`pymde`**: A library for creating embeddings, used in the `embedding_numbers.py` script to generate embeddings of the MNIST dataset.
- **`torch`**: Utilized for handling tensor operations and random permutations in the `embedding_numbers.py` script.
- **`numpy`**: Employed for numerical computations, especially in the `output.py` script for generating data for plots.
- **`math`**: Used for mathematical calculations, such as computing exponentials in the `readme_ui.py` script.

These dependencies are chosen for their specific functionalities that complement the `marimo` framework in creating interactive and data-driven applications.
