# Chat with Local Files

With GPTScript, interacting with local files is simple and powerful.
This can help you streamline repetitive or data-intensive tasks.
In this guide, we'll build a script that can query Excel files, CSVs, and PDFs.
We'll then use the script to read, transform, and utilize the data in these files.

## Too Long; Didn't Read

:::warning
The below command will allow GPTScript to work with the files in your ~/Documents directory. Change the directory if you want to restrict it.
:::

Want to start using this script now? Just run:
```
gptscript --workspace=~/Documents github.com/gptscript-ai/local-files-demo
```

## Getting Started

The rest of this guide will walk you through building and using a data processing assistant.

First, let's get some sample data to work with. You can clone our repo with our sample data:

```
git clone https://github.com/gptscript-ai/local-files-demo.git
cd local-files-demo
```

Next, open up a new gptscript file in your favorite editor. We'll call the file `data-assistant.gpt`.

```
vim data-assistant.gpt
```

All edits below are assumed to be in this file.

### Create the Assistant

Add this to the file:

```
Name: Data Processing Assitant
Description: An assistant to help you with processing data found in files on your workstation. Helpful for querying spreadsheets, CSVs, JSON files, and PDFs.
Tools: github.com/gptscript-ai/structured-data-querier, github.com/gptscript-ai/pdf-reader
Context: github.com/gptscript-ai/context/workspace
Chat: true

You are a helpful data processing assistant. Your goal is to help the user with data processing.
Help the user accomplish their tasks using the tools you have.
When the user starts this chat, say hi, introduce yourself, and ask what you can help with.
```

This is the entire script. Here's what each part does:

`Name and Description` help the LLM understand the purpose of this tool. You should always have meaningful names and descriptions.

The `Tools: ...` line provides two useful tools to this assistant.

The [structured-data-querier](https://github.com/gptscript-ai/structured-data-querier) makes it possible to query CSV, XLSX, and JSON files as though they were SQL databases (using an application called [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/)).
This is extremely powerful when combined with the power of LLMs because it allows you to ask natural language questions that the LLM can then translate to SQL.

The [pdf-reader](https://github.com/gptscript-ai/pdf-reader) parses and reads PDFs and returns the contents to the LLM.
This will put the entire contents in your chat context, so it's not appropriate for extremely large PDFs, but it's handy for smaller ones.

`Context: github.com/gptscript-ai/context/workspace` introduces a [context tool](../03-tools/05-context.md) makes this assistant "workspace" aware. Its description reads:
&gt; Adds the workspace and tools needed to access the workspace to the current context

Basically, this context tool tells the LLM what the workspace directory is and instructs it to use that directory for reading and writing files.
As we saw above, you can specify a workspace like this:

```
gptscript --workspace=/Your/path/here ...
```

If you don't specify one, a temporary directory will be created and used for the workspace.

This context tool also shares the `sys.read`, `sys.write`, and `sys.ls` built-in tools with the assistant.

Next we have `Chat: true`. This makes the current tool "chat-able". We refer to chat-able tools as agents or assistants.

Finally, we have the prompt:

&gt; You are a helpful data processing assistant. Your goal is to help the user with data processing.
&gt; Help the user accomplish their tasks using the tools you have.
&gt; When the user starts this chat, say hi, introduce yourself, and ask what you can help with.

## Using the Assistant

When you run the assistant, you can specify your own workspace folder or our sample data directory
Assuming you're using our sample data and have followed these instructions, here's how you run it:

```
gptscript --workspace=./sample-data data-assistant.gpt
```

Here's a few sample interactions with these files.

### Cleaning up data

```
&gt; whats in the key contacts file?

  The  key_contacts.txt  file contains the following information:

    Contains location, name & email
    Scranton - Michael michael@gptscript-fakeco.com
    Stamford Martin marty@gptscript-fakeco.com
    Nashua - Rachael, rach@gptscript-fakeco.com
    Utica,Ross - ross@gptscript-fakeco.com
    Albany    Allen    allen@gptscript-fakeco.com
    Akron;Pam;pam@gptscript-fakeco.com
    Camden. Kali. kali@gptscript-fakeco.com
    Yonkers - Meredith - meredith@gptscript-fakeco.com
    Rochester Kevin
    Syracuse William will@gptscript-fakeco.com

  Is there anything specific you would like to do with this information?

&gt; That looks bad. Can you make a cleaned up csv of it?

  Sure, I'll clean up the data and create a CSV file for you. Here's the cleaned-up data in CSV format:

    Location,Name,Email
    Scranton,Michael,michael@gptscript-fakeco.com
    Stamford,Martin,marty@gptscript-fakeco.com
    Nashua,Rachael,rach@gptscript-fakeco.com
    Utica,Ross,ross@gptscript-fakeco.com
    Albany,Allen,allen@gptscript-fakeco.com
    Akron,Pam,pam@gptscript-fakeco.com
    Camden,Kali,kali@gptscript-fakeco.com
    Yonkers,Meredith,meredith@gptscript-fakeco.com
    Rochester,Kevin,
    Syracuse,William,will@gptscript-fakeco.com

  I will now create a CSV file with this cleaned-up data.
```

### Identifying and fixing data gaps

```
&gt; is there any missing data in that csv?
...
  Yes, there is missing data in the CSV file. Specifically, the email for Kevin in Rochester is missing.

  Would you like to update this information or perform any other actions?
&gt; yes set his email to kev@ and use the same domain as the others

  I will update Kevin's email to  kev@gptscript-fakeco.com  in the CSV file.
```

### Cross-referencing

```
&gt; what were sales like for Kevin's location?

  To find out sales for Kevin's location, I will need to check the  yoy_sales.xlsx  file for any relevant data. Let me take a
  look at the contents of that file.
...
