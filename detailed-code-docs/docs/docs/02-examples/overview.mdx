## High-level description
This directory contains example scripts and guides for using GPTScript in various scenarios. It demonstrates how to integrate GPTScript with different systems and APIs, work with local files, and create automated workflows.

## What does it do?
The examples in this directory showcase different capabilities of GPTScript:

1. Interacting with a local CLI (GitHub CLI in this case)
2. Creating a chatbot interface for an API (DigitalOcean API)
3. Working with local files (Excel, CSV, PDF)
4. Running an automated workflow (summarizing tweets and their linked content)

These examples provide practical demonstrations of how to use GPTScript for various tasks, from simple CLI interactions to more complex data processing and API integrations.

## Key Files
