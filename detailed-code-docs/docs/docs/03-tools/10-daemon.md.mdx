# Daemon Tools (Advanced)

One advanced use case that GPTScript supports is daemon tools.
A daemon tool is a tool that starts a long-running HTTP server in the background, that will continue running until GPTScript is done executing.
Other tools can easily send HTTP POST requests to the daemon tool.

## Example

Here is an example of a daemon tool with a simple echo server written in an inline Node.js script:

```
Tools: my-daemon
Param: first: the first parameter
Param: second: the second parameter

#!http://my-daemon.daemon.gptscript.local/myPath

---
Name: my-daemon

#!sys.daemon node

const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) =&gt; {
    if (req.method === 'GET' || req.method === 'POST') {
        // Extract the path from the request URL
        const path = req.url;

        let body = '';

        req.on('data', chunk =&gt; {
          body += chunk.toString();
        })

        // Respond with the path and body
        req.on('end', () =&gt; {
          res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
          res.write(`Body: ${body}\n`);
          res.end(`Path: ${path}`);
        })
    } else {
        res.writeHead(405, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
        res.end('Method Not Allowed');
    }
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
server.listen(PORT, () =&gt; {
    console.log(`Server is listening on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

Let's talk about the daemon tool, called `my-daemon`, first.

### The Daemon Tool

The body of this tool begins with `#!sys.daemon`. This tells GPTScript to take the rest of the body as a command to be
run in the background that will listen for HTTP requests. GPTScript will run this command (in this case, a Node script).
GPTScript will assign a port number for the server and set the `PORT` environment variable to that number, so the
server needs to check that variable and listen on the proper port.

After GPTScript runs the daemon, it will send it an HTTP GET request to make sure that it is running properly.
The daemon needs to respond with a 200 OK to this request.
By default, the request goes to `/`, but this can be configured with the following syntax:

```
#!sys.daemon (path=/api/ready) node

// (node script here)
```

### The Entrypoint Tool

The entrypoint tool at the top of this script sends an HTTP request to the daemon tool.
There are a few important things to note here:

- The `Tools: my-daemon` directive is needed to show that this tool requires the `my-daemon` tool to already be running.
  - When the entrypoint tool runs, GPTScript will check if `my-daemon` is already running. If it is not, GPTScript will start it.
- The `#!http://my-daemon.daemon.gptscript.local/myPath` in the body tells GPTScript to send an HTTP request to the daemon tool.
  - The request will be a POST request, with the body of the request being a JSON string of the parameters passed to the entrypoint tool.
    - For example, if the script is run like `gptscript script.gpt '{"first":"hello","second":"world"}'`, then the body of the request will be `{"first":"hello","second":"world"}`.
    - The path of the request will be `/myPath`.
  - The hostname is `my-daemon.daemon.gptscript.local`. When sending a request to a daemon tool, the hostname must always start with the daemon tool's name, followed by `.daemon.gptscript.local`.
    - GPTScript recognizes this hostname and determines the correct port number to send the request to, on localhost.

### Running the Example

Now let's try running it:

```bash
gptscript script.gpt '{"first":"hello","second":"world"}'
```

```
OUTPUT:

Body: {"first":"hello","second":"world"}
Path: /myPath
```

This is exactly what we expected. This is a silly, small example just to demonstrate how this feature works.
A real-world situation would involve several different tools sending different HTTP requests to the daemon tool,
likely with an LLM determining when to call which tool.
