## High-level description
This JSON file defines the category configuration for the "03-tools" section in the documentation. It sets the label to "Writing GPTScripts", indicating that this section focuses on providing information about writing GPTScripts.

## What does it do?
This configuration file serves to organize and structure the documentation. It assigns a human-readable label ("Writing GPTScripts") to the "03-tools" section, which is likely used by a documentation system or static site generator to display the category name in navigation menus, table of contents, or other organizational elements of the documentation website.

## Key Files
The file itself, `_category_.json`, is the key file in this context. It contains a simple JSON object with a single key-value pair:

```json
{
  "label": "Writing GPTScripts"
}
```

This configuration is typically used in documentation systems like Docusaurus to define category labels for different sections of the documentation.

## Configuration
The file contains one configurable option:

| Option | Type   | Value              | Description                                        |
|--------|--------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| label  | string | "Writing GPTScripts" | The display name for the "03-tools" documentation category |

This configuration allows documentation maintainers to easily change the display name of the category without modifying other parts of the documentation or the system that generates it.
