## High-level description

This directory contains the command-line reference documentation for the GPTScript tool. It includes detailed information about the main `gptscript` command and its various subcommands, along with their respective options and flags.

## What does it do?

The command-line reference provides users with comprehensive documentation on how to use the GPTScript tool from the command line. It explains:

1. The main `gptscript` command and its general options
2. Subcommands for specific functionalities like credential management, evaluation, formatting, and parsing
3. Available flags and options for each command and subcommand
4. Environment variables that can be used to configure the tool
5. Examples of command usage and syntax

This documentation helps users understand how to interact with GPTScript, configure its behavior, and utilize its various features effectively through the command-line interface.

## Key Files

1. `gptscript.md`: This file documents the main `gptscript` command, including its general syntax, options, and available subcommands. It serves as the entry point for understanding the tool's command-line interface.

2. `gptscript_credential.md`: Documents the `gptscript credential` subcommand, which is used for managing stored credentials. It includes options for listing, deleting, and showing credential information.

3. `gptscript_eval.md`: Describes the `gptscript eval` subcommand, which is likely used for evaluating GPTScript code or prompts.

4. `gptscript_fmt.md`: Covers the `gptscript fmt` subcommand, probably used for formatting GPTScript files.

5. `gptscript_getenv.md`: Explains the `gptscript getenv` subcommand, which is used to look up environment variables for use in GPTScript tools.

6. `gptscript_parse.md`: Documents the `gptscript parse` subcommand, likely used for parsing GPTScript files or input.

Each of these files follows a similar structure, providing information about the command's syntax, available options, and any inherited options from the parent command.

## Configuration

The GPTScript tool uses various configuration options that can be set through command-line flags or environment variables. Some key configuration aspects include:

1. Cache directory: Configurable via `--cache-dir` or `$GPTSCRIPT_CACHE_DIR`
2. Credential context: Set with `--credential-context` or `$GPTSCRIPT_CREDENTIAL_CONTEXT`
3. Default model: Specified using `--default-model` or `$GPTSCRIPT_DEFAULT_MODEL`
4. OpenAI API settings: Configured with `--openai-api-key`, `--openai-base-url`, and `--openai-org-id` flags or corresponding environment variables

The tool also supports a configuration file, which can be specified using the `--config` flag or `$GPTSCRIPT_CONFIG` environment variable.

## Dependencies

While the command-line reference doesn't explicitly mention external dependencies, it's clear that the GPTScript tool integrates with OpenAI's API for language model functionality. This is evident from the OpenAI-specific configuration options available.

The tool also seems to have built-in support for caching, workspace management, and event streaming, which may rely on internal or external libraries for implementation.

In conclusion, this command-line reference provides a comprehensive guide for users to interact with the GPTScript tool, offering a wide range of options for customization and control over its behavior. The documentation is structured to facilitate easy navigation and understanding of the tool's capabilities and configuration options.
