# Supported Models and Platforms

GPTScript can be used against alternative models that expose an OpenAI-compatible API or have a provider available.
Here is an example using Claude:

```gptscript
model: claude-3-haiku-20240307 from github.com/gptscript-ai/claude3-anthropic-provider

Say hello world
```

A note on model compatibility:

:::important
While the providers allow GPTScript to work with other models, the effectiveness of using a
different model will depend on a combination of prompt engineering and the quality of the model. You may need to change
wording or add more description if you are not getting the results you want. In some cases, the model might not be
capable of intelligently handling the complex function calls.
:::

## Authentication

Each provider has different requirements for authentication. Please check the readme for the provider you are
trying to use.

## Available Model Providers

The following providers are currently available:

* [github.com/gptscript-ai/azure-openai-provider](https://github.com/gptscript-ai/azure-openai-provider)
* [github.com/gptscript-ai/azure-other-provider](https://github.com/gptscript-ai/azure-other-provider)
* [github.com/gptscript-ai/claude3-anthropic-provider](https://github.com/gptscript-ai/claude3-anthropic-provider)
* [github.com/gptscript-ai/claude3-bedrock-provider](https://github.com/gptscript-ai/claude3-bedrock-provider)
* [github.com/gptscript-ai/gemini-aistudio-provider](https://github.com/gptscript-ai/gemini-aistudio-provider)
* [github.com/gptscript-ai/gemini-vertexai-provider](https://github.com/gptscript-ai/gemini-vertexai-provider)
* [github.com/gptscript-ai/mistral-laplateforme-provider](https://github.com/gptscript-ai/mistral-laplateforme-provider)

## Listing available models

For any provider that supports listing models, you can use this command:

```bash
gptscript --list-models github.com/gptscript-ai/claude3-anthropic-provider
```

## OpenAI-Compatible APIs (Advanced)

:::warning
Even if a non-OpenAI service has an API that claims to be OpenAI-compatible, there are usually subtle differences that cause things to break.
The approach described in this section often does not work.
:::

You can use a model from an OpenAI-compatible API like this:

```gptscript
model: mistral-large-latest from https://api.mistral.ai/v1

Say hello world
```

:::note
Mistral's La Plateforme has an OpenAI-compatible API, but the model does not behave identically to gpt-4.
For that reason, we also have a provider for it that might get better results in some cases.
:::

### Authentication

For OpenAI-compatible providers, GPTScript will look for an API key to be configured with the
prefix `GPTSCRIPT_PROVIDER_`, the base domain converted to environment variable format, and a suffix of `_API_KEY`.
For example, if you are using `mistral-large-latest from https://api.mistral.ai/v1`, the environment variable would
be `GPTSCRIPT_PROVIDER_API_MISTRAL_AI_API_KEY`.

### Listing available models

You can list models from an OpenAI-compatible API like this:

```bash
gptscript --list-models https://api.mistral.ai/v1
```
