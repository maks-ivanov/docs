## High-level description
The `layout.html` file is a Jinja2 template used in a Sphinx documentation project. It extends the base layout from the `pydata_sphinx_theme` and customizes the font settings for the body and header elements of the documentation pages. This customization is achieved by overriding the `fonts` block to include specific CSS styles for font-family declarations.

## Code Structure
The file uses Jinja2 templating syntax to extend a base template and override specific blocks. The main block overridden in this file is the `fonts` block, which is used to define custom font styles.

## Symbols

### `{% extends "pydata_sphinx_theme/layout.html" %}`
#### Description
This line indicates that the current template extends the `layout.html` template from the `pydata_sphinx_theme`. This means that the current template inherits all the content and structure from the base template, allowing for selective customization.

### `{% block fonts %}`
#### Description
This block is used to define custom font styles for the documentation. By overriding this block, the template can specify additional CSS styles that will be applied to the documentation pages.

#### Internal Logic
- The block contains a `&lt;style&gt;` tag that defines the `font-family` for the `body` and `.header-style` elements.
- The specified fonts include a list of system and web fonts, providing a fallback chain to ensure good cross-platform coverage.
