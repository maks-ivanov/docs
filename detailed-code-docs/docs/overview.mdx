## High-level description

The `docs` directory is part of a Sphinx documentation setup for a project, likely named Cassiopeia. It contains various components necessary for generating and customizing the project's documentation. The main components include:

- **Static Files (`_static`)**: Custom CSS stylesheets to enhance the visual presentation of the documentation.
- **Templates (`_templates`)**: Jinja2 templates for customizing the layout and appearance of documentation pages.
- **Configuration (`conf.py`)**: A configuration script that sets up Sphinx extensions, paths, and custom logic for documentation generation.
- **Extensions (`extensions`)**: Custom Sphinx extensions to enhance the parsing and presentation of documentation, particularly for NumPy-style docstrings.

## What does it do?

The `docs` directory is responsible for generating and customizing the documentation for the Cassiopeia project using Sphinx. Here's how it works:

1. **Styling and Layout**: 
   - The `_static` directory contains CSS files that override default theme styles to ensure the documentation is visually appealing and consistent. For example, `override.css` customizes the Furo theme's default styles, while `sphinx_gallery.css` styles elements within a Sphinx gallery.
   - The `_templates` directory includes a `layout.html` file that extends the base layout from the `pydata_sphinx_theme` and customizes font settings for the documentation pages.

2. **Configuration**:
   - The `conf.py` file configures Sphinx to generate the documentation. It sets up extensions, paths, and options for HTML output. It also includes custom logic for generating autosummaries of class methods and attributes, enhancing the documentation's comprehensiveness.

3. **Custom Extensions**:
   - The `extensions` directory contains a custom extension (`typed_returns.py`) that enhances the parsing of return sections in NumPy-style docstrings. This extension modifies the behavior of the `NumpyDocstring` class to format return types with Sphinx's cross-referencing capabilities, making the documentation more interactive and informative.

Overall, the `docs` directory ensures that the Cassiopeia project's documentation is not only functional but also visually appealing and easy to navigate, with enhanced features for documenting complex code structures.
