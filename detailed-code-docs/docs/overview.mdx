## High-level description
This directory contains documentation for GPTScript, a framework for interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs). It includes configuration files for the Docusaurus documentation site, content files explaining various aspects of GPTScript, and use case examples.

## What does it do?
The docs directory serves several purposes:

1. Provides comprehensive documentation on GPTScript, including installation, usage, and configuration.
2. Offers examples and use cases for GPTScript in various scenarios like retrieval, task automation, data analysis, and more.
3. Explains how to write GPTScripts and use different tools within the framework.
4. Provides a command-line reference for the GPTScript tool.
5. Describes how to use alternative model providers and manage credentials.
6. Answers frequently asked questions about GPTScript.
7. Sets up a Docusaurus-based website to present this information in an organized and accessible manner.

## Entry points
The main entry points for the documentation are:

1. `docs/docs/01-overview.md`: Provides an introduction to GPTScript, its capabilities, and installation instructions.
2. `docs/docusaurus.config.js`: Configures the Docusaurus site structure, appearance, and functionality.
3. `docs/sidebars.js`: Defines the sidebar structure for the documentation website.

The content flow starts from the overview, then branches into specific topics like examples, tools, command-line reference, and FAQs. The Docusaurus configuration ties these components together into a cohesive website.

## Key Files
1. `README-USECASES.md`: Describes various use cases for GPTScript, including retrieval, task automation, agents and assistants, data analysis, and more.
2. `docs/` directory: Contains the main documentation content, organized into topics like overview, examples, tools, command-line reference, and FAQs.
3. `docusaurus.config.js`: Configures the Docusaurus site, including site metadata, theming, and navigation.
4. `sidebars.js`: Defines the structure of the documentation sidebar.
5. `package.json`: Specifies the project dependencies and scripts for building and running the documentation site.

## Dependencies
The documentation site relies on several key dependencies:

1. Docusaurus: A modern static website generator, used as the foundation for the documentation site.
2. React: Used by Docusaurus for building the user interface.
3. Prism: Provides syntax highlighting for code blocks in the documentation.
4. Algolia: Integrated for search functionality within the documentation.

## Configuration
The documentation setup includes several configuration aspects:

1. Docusaurus configuration (`docusaurus.config.js`):
   - Site metadata (title, tagline, favicon)
   - Theming and UI components (navbar, footer)
   - Internationalization settings
   - Algolia search integration

2. Sidebar configuration (`sidebars.js`):
   - Automatically generated based on the filesystem structure of the docs folder

3. Package configuration (`package.json`):
   - Defines scripts for managing the Docusaurus project (start, build, deploy)
   - Specifies required dependencies
   - Sets browser compatibility targets

4. CSS customization (`src/css/custom.css`):
   - Defines custom color schemes for light and dark modes
   - Adjusts code font size and highlighted code line backgrounds

These configurations work together to create a comprehensive and user-friendly documentation website for GPTScript, making it easier for users to understand and utilize the framework effectively.
