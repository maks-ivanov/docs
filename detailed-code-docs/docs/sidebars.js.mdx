## High-level description
This code defines the sidebar configuration for a Docusaurus-based documentation website. It sets up an automatically generated sidebar structure based on the filesystem organization of the docs folder.

## Symbols

### `sidebars`
#### Description
The `sidebars` constant is an object that defines the configuration for the documentation sidebar. In this case, it's set up to use an automatically generated structure.

#### Inputs
This constant doesn't have inputs as it's a configuration object.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sidebars | Object | An object containing the sidebar configuration |

#### Internal Logic
The `sidebars` object contains a single property `sidebar`, which is an array with one element. This element is an object with two properties:
- `type: "autogenerated"`: Specifies that the sidebar should be automatically generated.
- `dirName: "."`: Indicates that the current directory (`.`) should be used as the root for generating the sidebar structure.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @docusaurus/plugin-content-docs | Type checking for the `SidebarsConfig` interface |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| sidebar | Array | `[{ type: "autogenerated", dirName: "." }]` | Defines the structure of the sidebar |

## Error Handling
This configuration file does not implement explicit error handling. Any configuration errors would likely be caught and reported by the Docusaurus build process.

## API/Interface Reference
While this file doesn't expose an API directly, it adheres to the `SidebarsConfig` interface provided by Docusaurus:

```typescript
/** @type {import('@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs').SidebarsConfig} */
```

This type annotation ensures that the `sidebars` object conforms to the expected structure for Docusaurus sidebar configuration.
