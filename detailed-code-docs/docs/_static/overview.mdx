## High-level description

The `docs/_static` directory contains static assets used for enhancing the visual and functional aspects of a web application. It includes two main subdirectories: `css` and `js`. The `css` subdirectory contains a `custom.css` file that defines custom styles for the application, focusing on font definitions, color schemes, layout adjustments, and responsive design. The `js` subdirectory contains an `analytics.js` file responsible for initializing and configuring the PostHog analytics library, enabling tracking of user interactions and analytics data on the webpage.

## What does it do?

The `docs/_static/css/custom.css` file is responsible for styling the web application. It defines how different elements should look, including fonts, colors, and layouts. It ensures that the application has a consistent and polished appearance across different themes (light and dark) and screen sizes. For example, it styles the sidebar text, announcement elements, and tables, and it uses media queries to adjust the layout for smaller screens.

The `docs/_static/js/analytics.js` file sets up the PostHog analytics library on the webpage. It loads the necessary script to enable tracking of user interactions, such as clicks and page views. This script is designed to be inserted into a webpage, where it initializes the PostHog object and prepares it to capture analytics data. It ensures that any events are queued until the library is fully loaded, allowing for seamless tracking without missing any interactions.

## Entry points

The main files in this directory are `custom.css` and `analytics.js`. 

- `custom.css` is the entry point for styling the web application. It organizes styles into sections for fonts, global styles, theme-specific styles, component-specific styles, and responsive design rules. The data flow involves applying these styles to HTML elements, while the control flow is determined by CSS selectors and media queries.

- `analytics.js` is the entry point for setting up analytics tracking. It uses an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) to encapsulate the initialization logic for the PostHog library. The data flow involves loading the PostHog script and queuing events, while the control flow is managed by the `init` function, which configures the PostHog object and its methods.

## Dependencies

The `analytics.js` file depends on the PostHog analytics library. This library is used to track user interactions and events on the webpage. The `init` function in `analytics.js` specifies the `api_host` configuration option, which is the URL for the PostHog API used to load the tracking script.
