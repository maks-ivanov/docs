## Dependencies

The CSS file does not directly depend on external libraries or modules, but it references variables and elements that are likely defined elsewhere in the application, such as `--font-size--normal`, `--color-background-border`, and `--color-content-foreground`.

## Configuration

The CSS file does not define configuration options but uses CSS variables for theme and color management, which are likely defined in a global stylesheet or a CSS-in-JS solution.

## Error Handling

CSS does not have traditional error handling mechanisms like programming languages. However, the use of CSS variables and fallback values can help manage styling issues if a variable is not defined.

## Logging

There is no logging mechanism in CSS.

## API/Interface Reference

The CSS file does not define an API but provides a styling interface for HTML elements and components within the web application.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
