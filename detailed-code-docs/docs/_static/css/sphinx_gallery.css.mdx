## High-level description

The `sphinx_gallery.css` file is a CSS stylesheet used to style elements within a Sphinx documentation gallery. It primarily targets elements with the class `sphx-glr-thumbcontainer` and its child elements, providing specific styling rules to control their appearance, such as layout, text alignment, and visibility.

## Code Structure

The CSS file contains several style rules that apply to elements with specific classes. These rules are used to modify the appearance of elements within the Sphinx gallery, such as hiding certain links, adjusting padding, and centering figures.

## Symbols

### `.sphx-glr-thumbcontainer .headerlink`
#### Description
This rule hides the header link within the thumbnail container by setting its display property to `none`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `.headerlink` | CSS class | Targets header links within the thumbnail container |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `display: none` | CSS property | Hides the element from view |

### `div.sphx-glr-thumbcontainer span`
#### Description
This rule ensures that any span elements within a `div` with the class `sphx-glr-thumbcontainer` have a normal font style.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `span` | CSS selector | Targets span elements within the specified div |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `font-style: normal` | CSS property | Sets the font style to normal |

### `.sphx-glr-thumbcontainer a.internal`
#### Description
This rule adjusts the padding of internal links within the thumbnail container, likely to control the vertical spacing and alignment of content.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `a.internal` | CSS class | Targets internal links within the thumbnail container |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `padding: 140px 10px 0` | CSS property | Sets the padding for the element |

### `.sphx-glr-thumbcontainer .figure.align-center`
#### Description
This rule centers figures within the thumbnail container by setting text alignment and applying a transformation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `.figure.align-center` | CSS class | Targets figures with the align-center class within the thumbnail container |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `text-align: center` | CSS property | Centers the text within the figure |
| `margin-left: 0%` | CSS property | Removes left margin |
| `transform: translate(0%)` | CSS property | Applies a translation transformation |

## Side Effects

- The `.sphx-glr-thumbcontainer .headerlink` rule hides header links, which may affect navigation or accessibility if these links are intended to be visible.
- The `.sphx-glr-thumbcontainer a.internal` rule significantly increases the top padding, which could affect the layout and spacing of elements within the container.

## Dependencies

This CSS file is likely used in conjunction with Sphinx, a documentation generator, and its gallery extension. It assumes the presence of specific HTML structures generated by Sphinx.

## Performance Considerations

- The use of `!important` in several rules can make it difficult to override these styles elsewhere, potentially leading to increased specificity conflicts in larger stylesheets.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
