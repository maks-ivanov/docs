## High-level description

The directory contains custom CSS stylesheets designed to enhance and modify the appearance of documentation generated using the Sphinx documentation generator. Specifically, it includes styles for overriding default theme styles and for customizing the appearance of a Sphinx gallery. The two main files in this directory are `override.css` and `sphinx_gallery.css`, each serving distinct purposes in the styling of documentation elements.

## What does it do?

The CSS files in this directory are used to customize the visual presentation of documentation. They achieve this by overriding default styles provided by themes and by applying specific styles to elements within the documentation. 

- **`override.css`**: This file is used to customize the default styles provided by the Furo theme and potentially other themes. It defines styles for various HTML elements and classes to ensure a consistent and visually appealing presentation. For example, it styles code blocks, citations, introductory cards, buttons, and notebook input/output containers. This customization ensures that the documentation is not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing and easy to read.

- **`sphinx_gallery.css`**: This file is specifically used to style elements within a Sphinx documentation gallery. It targets elements with the class `sphx-glr-thumbcontainer` and its child elements, providing specific styling rules to control their appearance. This includes hiding certain links, adjusting padding, and centering figures. The goal is to ensure that the gallery elements are well-organized and visually coherent, enhancing the user's ability to navigate and understand the content.

## Dependencies

The CSS files are designed to work in conjunction with the Sphinx documentation generator and its extensions, such as the Sphinx gallery extension. They assume the presence of specific HTML structures generated by Sphinx and are intended to override or complement the default styles provided by themes like Furo. While the files do not explicitly import external libraries, they are dependent on the HTML structure and classes generated by Sphinx and its extensions.
