## High-level description

This directory contains CSS files that customize the appearance of Streamlink's documentation. The main file, `override.css`, modifies the default styles of the Furo Sphinx theme, while `sphinx_gallery.css` focuses on enhancing the visual presentation of Sphinx Gallery thumbnails.

## What does it do?

These CSS files work together to improve the readability and visual appeal of Streamlink's documentation. They accomplish this by:

1. Customizing the appearance of code blocks, citations, headings, and buttons.
2. Styling elements specific to the "Getting Started" page, such as intro cards and custom buttons.
3. Adjusting the display of Jupyter Notebook elements for better integration within the documentation.
4. Enhancing the presentation of Sphinx Gallery thumbnails, including their containers, links, timings, and figure alignment.
