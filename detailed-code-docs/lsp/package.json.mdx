title: "package.json"
---

## High-level description
The `package.json` file is a configuration file for a Node.js project, specifically for a Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation. It defines scripts for building and type-checking the project, as well as the project's dependencies and development dependencies required for building and running the LSP server.

## Code Structure
The `package.json` file is structured into several key sections:
- **scripts**: Defines command-line scripts for building and type-checking the project.
- **dependencies**: Lists the runtime dependencies required for the project.
- **devDependencies**: Lists the development dependencies needed for building and testing the project.

## Symbols

### Scripts
#### Description
The `scripts` section defines various command-line tasks that can be executed using a package manager like `npm` or `pnpm`.

#### Entries
- **build:ts**: Compiles the TypeScript file `index.ts` into a CommonJS module and minifies the output using `tsup`.
- **build:deps**: Copies the `copilot` directory from the `copilot-node-server` package into the `dist` directory.
- **typecheck**: Runs TypeScript's type checker without emitting any output files.
- **build**: Executes both the `build:ts` and `build:deps` scripts in sequence.

### Dependencies
#### Description
The `dependencies` section lists packages that are required for the project to run in production.

#### Entries
- **copilot-node-server**: A package required for the LSP server, version `1.37.0`.

### DevDependencies
#### Description
The `devDependencies` section lists packages that are only needed during the development and build process.

#### Entries
- **@sourcegraph/vscode-ws-jsonrpc**: A forked version of a JSON-RPC library for WebSocket communication.
- **@types/minimist**: Type definitions for the `minimist` library.
- **@types/node**: Type definitions for Node.js.
- **@types/ws**: Type definitions for the `ws` WebSocket library.
- **jsonrpc-ws-proxy**: A library for proxying JSON-RPC over WebSockets.
- **minimist**: A library for parsing command-line arguments.
- **tsup**: A TypeScript bundler used for building the project.
- **typescript**: The TypeScript language and compiler.
- **ws**: A WebSocket library for Node.js.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| copilot-node-server | Provides server functionality for the LSP. |
| @sourcegraph/vscode-ws-jsonrpc | Enables JSON-RPC communication over WebSockets. |
| @types/minimist | Provides TypeScript types for the `minimist` library. |
| @types/node | Provides TypeScript types for Node.js APIs. |
| @types/ws | Provides TypeScript types for the `ws` library. |
| jsonrpc-ws-proxy | Facilitates JSON-RPC communication over WebSockets. |
| minimist | Parses command-line arguments. |
| tsup | Bundles TypeScript files for production. |
| typescript | Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript. |
| ws | Implements WebSocket protocol for Node.js. |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| scripts | object | N/A | Defines build and type-checking commands. |
| dependencies | object | N/A | Lists runtime dependencies. |
| devDependencies | object | N/A | Lists development dependencies. |

## Error Handling
The `package.json` file itself does not handle errors, but the scripts defined within it may produce errors if the commands fail. For example, if `tsup` or `tsc` encounters issues during the build or type-checking process, they will output error messages to the console.

## Logging
There is no explicit logging defined in the `package.json` file, but the tools and scripts it references may produce logs or console output during execution.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the `package.json` file.
