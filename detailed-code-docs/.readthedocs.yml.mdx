## High-level description
The `.readthedocs.yml` file is a configuration file used by Read the Docs to automate the building and hosting of documentation for a project. It specifies the environment and tools required to build the documentation, including the operating system, Python version, and additional dependencies needed for the documentation build process.

## Code Structure
The file is structured in a YAML format, which is a human-readable data serialization standard. It contains several key sections: `version`, `build`, `sphinx`, and `python`, each specifying different aspects of the documentation build configuration.

## Symbols

### `version`
#### Description
Specifies the version of the Read the Docs configuration file format being used.

### `build`
#### Description
Defines the build environment for the documentation, including the operating system and tools.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| os | string | The operating system to use for the build environment. |
| tools | dictionary | Specifies the tools and their versions required for the build. |

#### Outputs
There are no direct outputs from this section; it configures the environment for the build process.

### `sphinx`
#### Description
Specifies the configuration file for Sphinx, the documentation generator.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| configuration | string | Path to the Sphinx configuration file. |

#### Outputs
There are no direct outputs from this section; it points to the configuration file used by Sphinx.

### `python`
#### Description
Configures the Python environment for the documentation build, including installation methods and additional requirements.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| install | list | A list of installation methods and requirements for Python packages. |

#### Outputs
There are no direct outputs from this section; it configures the Python environment for the build process.

#### Internal Logic
- The `install` section specifies that packages should be installed using `pip`.
- The `path` is set to `.` indicating the current directory.
- `extra_requirements` lists additional dependencies needed for building the documentation, such as `docs` and `spatial`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| pip | Used to install Python packages specified in the `extra_requirements`. |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| os | string | ubuntu-22.04 | Specifies the operating system for the build environment. |
| python | string | 3.9 | Specifies the Python version to use. |
| configuration | string | docs/conf.py | Path to the Sphinx configuration file. |
| method | string | pip | Method used to install Python packages. |
| path | string | . | Directory path for the Python installation. |
| extra_requirements | list | - | Additional Python packages required for the documentation build. |

## Error Handling
The file itself does not contain error handling logic, but incorrect configurations can lead to build failures on Read the Docs.

## Logging
There is no explicit logging mechanism defined in this configuration file.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
