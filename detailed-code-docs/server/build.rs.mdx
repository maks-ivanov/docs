## High-level description
This Rust build script defines two different build behaviors based on the presence of the `runtime-env` feature flag. If the flag is not set, it loads environment variables from a `.env` file and makes them available to the Rust compiler. If the flag is set, the build script does nothing.

## Table of contents
- Conditional Compilation based on `runtime-env` feature flag
  - Behavior without `runtime-env`
  - Behavior with `runtime-env`

## Code Structure
The code uses conditional compilation (`cfg` attribute) to define two different `main` functions, effectively choosing which one to execute based on the `runtime-env` feature flag.

## Symbols

### `main` (without `runtime-env`)
#### Description
This function loads environment variables from a `.env` file and passes them to the Rust compiler as environment variables. It also instructs Cargo to rerun the build script if the `.env` file changes.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
- Prints environment variables in the format `cargo:rustc-env={key}={value}` to stdout, which Cargo captures and uses to set environment variables during compilation.
- Prints `cargo:rerun-if-changed=.env` to stdout, instructing Cargo to rerun the build script if the `.env` file changes.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `dotenv` crate to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
2. Iterates through the loaded environment variables and prints them in the format `cargo:rustc-env={key}={value}`.
3. Prints `cargo:rerun-if-changed=.env`.

#### Side Effects
- Modifies the build environment by setting environment variables.

### `main` (with `runtime-env`)
#### Description
This function does nothing. It is used when the `runtime-env` feature flag is enabled, indicating that environment variables should be handled at runtime instead of compile time.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `dotenv` | Loads environment variables from a `.env` file. |

## Future Improvements
- The error handling could be improved by providing more informative error messages to the user.
- The build script could be modified to support loading environment variables from sources other than a `.env` file, such as a configuration file or command-line arguments.
