## High-level description
This Rust module provides a utility function for generating random organization names by combining two 4-letter words from a predefined list. It uses the `rand` crate for random number generation and includes tracing instrumentation.

## Table of contents
- Function `random_organization_name`

## Symbols

### `random_organization_name`
#### Description
This function generates a random organization name by combining two 4-letter words from a predefined list. It uses the `rand` crate to select random words and formats them with a hyphen separator.

#### Inputs
This function takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return value | String | A randomly generated organization name |

#### Internal Logic
1. Reads a list of 4-letter words from an included text file.
2. Initializes a random number generator.
3. Selects two random indices within the range of the word list.
4. Retrieves the words at the selected indices.
5. Formats and returns the combined words as a hyphenated string.

#### Performance Considerations
The function reads the word list from a file on each call, which may impact performance for frequent invocations. Consider caching the word list for better efficiency in high-frequency usage scenarios.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rand | Used for random number generation |
| tracing | Used for instrumenting the function for observability |

## Future Improvements
1. Cache the word list to avoid reading from the file on each function call.
2. Allow customization of the word list or the number of words in the generated name.
3. Implement error handling for cases where the word file might be missing or empty.
4. Add unit tests to ensure the function behaves correctly under various conditions.
