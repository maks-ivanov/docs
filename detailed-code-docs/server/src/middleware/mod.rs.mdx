## High-level description
This code defines a module structure for middleware components in a Rust server application. It includes three submodules: api_version, auth_middleware, and json_middleware, which are likely used to handle API versioning, authentication, and JSON processing in the server's request-response cycle.

## Table of contents
- Module declaration
- Submodule imports

## Code Structure
The `mod.rs` file serves as the entry point for the middleware module, organizing related middleware components into separate submodules.

## Symbols

### `pub mod api_version`
#### Description
This submodule likely contains middleware for handling API versioning.

### `pub mod auth_middleware`
#### Description
This submodule probably includes middleware for authentication and authorization.

### `pub mod json_middleware`
#### Description
This submodule likely contains middleware for processing JSON data in requests and responses.

## Dependencies
The code itself doesn't directly use any external dependencies, but the submodules it imports may have their own dependencies.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding documentation comments to each submodule import to briefly describe their purposes.
- If more middleware components are added in the future, they can be easily included by adding new `pub mod` declarations.

Based on the related code snippets provided, we can infer more details about two of the submodules:

1. `api_version`: This submodule defines an `APIVersion` enum and middleware for handling API versioning. It includes logic to determine the API version based on request headers or dataset creation date.

2. `json_middleware`: This submodule implements middleware to ensure that requests have a "Content-Type: application/json" header if not already present.

The `auth_middleware` submodule is not provided in the related snippets, so its specific implementation details are unknown.
