## High-level description
The `/server/src/handlers` directory houses the core logic for handling API requests in the Trieve application. Each sub-module within this directory is responsible for a specific domain, such as managing users, datasets, chunks, or handling authentication. 

## What does it do?
This directory acts as the brain of the Trieve application's API. When a user interacts with the application, their requests are routed to specific handlers within this directory based on the requested URL and HTTP method. These handlers then process the request, interact with the database or other services as needed, and ultimately send back a response to the user. For example, the `dataset_handler` module handles requests for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting datasets, while the `auth_handler` module manages user authentication and authorization. 

## Entry points
While there is no single entry point to this directory, each sub-module can be considered an entry point for its specific domain. For instance, if you're looking for how user authentication is handled, the `auth_handler.rs` file would be the starting point. 

The code is organized conceptually by domain, with each sub-module representing a specific area of functionality. Data flow generally starts with the handler receiving a request, processing it, potentially interacting with the database or other services, and finally returning a response. Control flow is dictated by the routing logic defined in the API framework, which directs requests to the appropriate handler functions.
