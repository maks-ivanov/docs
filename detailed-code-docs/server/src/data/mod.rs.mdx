### `models`
#### Description
This submodule defines the data models for the application, including structs for users, topics, messages, chunks, files, organizations, and other entities. It also includes enums for roles, event types, and other data types.

#### Internal Logic
The `models` submodule defines various structs and enums that represent the data structures used in the application. These structs and enums are used to interact with the database and other data sources.

### `schema`
#### Description
This submodule defines the database schema for the application, using the Diesel ORM. It specifies the tables, columns, and relationships between the different data models.

#### Internal Logic
The `schema` submodule uses Diesel macros to define the database schema. These macros generate SQL statements that are used to create and manage the database tables.
