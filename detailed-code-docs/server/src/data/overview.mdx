## High-level description
The `server/src/data` directory houses the data models, database schema, and other data-related components for the Trieve application. It's responsible for defining how data is represented within the application and how it's persisted in the database.

## What does it do?
This directory defines the structure of the data used by the Trieve application, including users, topics, messages, chunks of data, files, organizations, and more. It also defines how this data is stored in a database using the Diesel ORM. This means it outlines the tables, columns, and relationships between different data entities, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

## Key Files
### server/src/data/models.rs
This file defines the data structures, represented as structs and enums, for various entities in the Trieve application. These structures dictate how data is organized and accessed within the application's code.

### server/src/data/schema.rs
This file defines the database schema for the Trieve application using the Diesel ORM. It maps the data structures defined in `models.rs` to database tables, columns, and relationships, enabling the application to interact with the database in a structured and type-safe manner.

## Dependencies
### diesel
Diesel is an ORM used for database interactions in Rust. It provides a safe and convenient way to interact with databases by mapping Rust structs to database tables and providing type-safe queries.
