## High-level description
This SQL script creates a `topics` table in a database, defining its structure with columns for topic identification, user association, resolution text, side selection, deletion status, and timestamps.

## Table of contents
- Table creation
- Column definitions
- Constraints and references

## Code Structure
The code consists of a single SQL statement that creates the `topics` table with specific columns and constraints.

## Symbols

### CREATE TABLE topics
#### Description
This SQL command creates a new table named `topics` in the database with the specified columns and constraints.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines the table name as `topics`
2. Specifies columns with their data types and constraints
3. Sets up a foreign key reference to the `users` table

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| users table | Referenced by the `user_id` column |

## Configuration
| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|:------------|
| id | UUID | NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY | Unique identifier for each topic |
| user_id | UUID | NOT NULL, REFERENCES users(id) | Foreign key linking to the users table |
| resolution | TEXT | NOT NULL | The text of the topic resolution |
| side | BOOLEAN | NOT NULL | Indicates the side of the topic (true/false) |
| deleted | BOOLEAN | NOT NULL, DEFAULT FALSE | Soft delete flag for the topic |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | NOT NULL | Timestamp of when the topic was created |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMP | NOT NULL | Timestamp of when the topic was last updated |

## Future Improvements
1. Consider adding indexes on frequently queried columns like `user_id` or `created_at` for improved query performance.
2. Implement a check constraint on the `side` column to ensure it only contains valid values if there are specific requirements.
3. Add a `title` column for a brief description of the topic, which could be useful for listing and searching topics.
4. Include a `status` column to track the current state of the topic (e.g., active, closed, archived) if applicable to the application's logic.
