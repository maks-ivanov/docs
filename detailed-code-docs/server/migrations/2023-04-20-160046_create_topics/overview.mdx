## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for managing the `topics` table in the database. It includes an "up" migration to create the table and a "down" migration to drop it. These scripts are likely part of a larger migration system that allows for version-controlled database schema changes.

## What does it do?
These SQL scripts define the structure of the `topics` table and manage its lifecycle within the database. The "up" migration script creates the table and defines its columns, including data types, constraints, and relationships with other tables (like the `users` table). The "down" migration script handles the removal of the `topics` table when rolling back the migration.

## Key Files
### up.sql
This script is responsible for creating the `topics` table and defining its schema. It specifies the following columns:

- `id`: Unique identifier for each topic.
- `user_id`: Foreign key linking the topic to a user in the `users` table.
- `resolution`: The text of the topic resolution.
- `side`: A boolean value indicating the side of the topic.
- `deleted`: A boolean flag for soft deletion of the topic.
- `created_at`: Timestamp of the topic creation.
- `updated_at`: Timestamp of the last update to the topic.

### down.sql
This script handles the rollback of the `topics` table creation. It simply drops the table from the database if it exists.

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS topics;
```
