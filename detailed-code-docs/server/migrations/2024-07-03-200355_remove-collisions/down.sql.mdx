## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It focuses on modifying the `chunk_metadata` table and recreating the `chunk_collisions` table, effectively undoing a previous migration that likely removed these elements.

## Table of contents
- Modify `chunk_metadata` table
- Recreate `chunk_collisions` table

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the `chunk_metadata` table by making the `qdrant_point_id` column nullable.

#### Internal Logic
The command uses the `ALTER TABLE` statement to modify the `chunk_metadata` table. It then uses `ALTER COLUMN` to change the `qdrant_point_id` column, specifically dropping the `NOT NULL` constraint.

### CREATE TABLE chunk_collisions
#### Description
This SQL command recreates the `chunk_collisions` table with specific columns and constraints.

#### Internal Logic
The `CREATE TABLE` statement is used to define a new table named `chunk_collisions`. The table is created with the following columns:
- `id`: UUID, set as the primary key
- `chunk_id`: UUID, not nullable
- `collision_qdrant_id`: UUID
- `created_at`: TIMESTAMP, not nullable
- `updated_at`: TIMESTAMP, not nullable

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding foreign key constraints to ensure referential integrity, especially for the `chunk_id` column in the `chunk_collisions` table.
- If applicable, add indexes to improve query performance, particularly on columns frequently used in WHERE clauses or joins.
- Depending on the application's needs, consider adding a CASCADE option to the `ALTER TABLE` statement to handle any dependent objects.
