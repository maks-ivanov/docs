This SQL file contains a migration script to create a new table named "invitations" in a database. Here's a breakdown of what the script does:

1. It creates a table called "invitations" with the following columns:

   a. id: A UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) that serves as the primary key for the table. It is set to NOT NULL and UNIQUE.

   b. email: A VARCHAR column with a maximum length of 100 characters, set to NOT NULL. This likely stores the email address of the invited user.

   c. expires_at: A TIMESTAMP column set to NOT NULL, probably used to store the expiration date and time of the invitation.

   d. created_at: A TIMESTAMP column set to NOT NULL, likely used to store the date and time when the invitation was created.

   e. updated_at: A TIMESTAMP column set to NOT NULL, probably used to store the date and time when the invitation was last updated.

2. The script uses standard SQL syntax to create the table and define its structure.

3. The file name suggests that this is an "up" migration, which is typically used to apply changes to the database schema (in this case, creating a new table).

This migration script is likely part of a database versioning system, allowing developers to track and manage changes to the database structure over time. When executed, it will create the "invitations" table in the target database with the specified structure.
