title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL script is designed to revert the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` migration. It drops the `invitations` table if it exists in the database.

## Table of contents
- Drop invitations table

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS invitations;`
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `invitations` table from the database schema if it exists.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the command will not throw an error if the table doesn't exist. This makes the migration script idempotent, allowing it to be run multiple times without causing issues.

## Side Effects
- Permanently removes the `invitations` table and all its data from the database.
- Any foreign key constraints referencing the `invitations` table will be affected.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a backup mechanism before dropping the table to prevent accidental data loss.
- If there are any dependencies on the `invitations` table (e.g., foreign key constraints), consider adding commands to remove these dependencies before dropping the table.
