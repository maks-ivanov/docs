## High-level description
This directory contains database migration scripts for managing the `invitations` table. It includes two SQL files: `up.sql` for creating the table and `down.sql` for reverting the changes.

## What does it do?
The `up.sql` script creates a new table called `invitations` in the database. This table stores information about invitations, including the invitee's email address, expiration date, and timestamps for creation and updates. 

The `down.sql` script handles the rollback process. If the `invitations` table exists, it's permanently removed from the database along with all its data. This ensures that the database schema can be reverted to its previous state if needed. 

These scripts are likely part of a database migration system that allows developers to track and manage changes to the database structure over time.
