## High-level description
This SQL migration script removes two columns, 'side' and 'normal_chat', from the 'topics' table in the database schema.

## Table of contents
- ALTER TABLE statement for removing 'side' column
- ALTER TABLE statement for removing 'normal_chat' column

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE topics DROP COLUMN side
#### Description
This SQL command removes the 'side' column from the 'topics' table.

#### Internal Logic
The ALTER TABLE statement is used to modify the structure of an existing table. The DROP COLUMN clause specifically removes a column from the table.

### ALTER TABLE topics DROP COLUMN normal_chat
#### Description
This SQL command removes the 'normal_chat' column from the 'topics' table.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to the previous command, this ALTER TABLE statement removes the 'normal_chat' column from the 'topics' table.

## Side Effects
- The 'topics' table structure is permanently modified.
- Any data previously stored in the 'side' and 'normal_chat' columns will be lost.
- Queries or application code relying on these columns will need to be updated to prevent errors.

## Future Improvements
- Consider creating a backup of the data in these columns before running the migration if the information might be needed later.
- Ensure that all parts of the application that previously used these columns are updated to reflect this change.
- If these columns were used in any indexes or constraints, those will need to be dropped or modified in a separate migration.
