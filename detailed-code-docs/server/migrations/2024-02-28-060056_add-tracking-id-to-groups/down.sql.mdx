## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `tracking_id` column from the `chunk_group` table and drops a unique constraint associated with it.

## Table of contents
- Alter `chunk_group` table to drop `tracking_id` column
- Drop unique constraint on `tracking_id` and `dataset_id`

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE chunk_group DROP COLUMN tracking_id
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `tracking_id` column from the `chunk_group` table.

#### Internal Logic
The command uses the `ALTER TABLE` statement to modify the `chunk_group` table structure by dropping the `tracking_id` column.

### ALTER TABLE chunk_group DROP CONSTRAINT chunk_group_tracking_id_dataset_id_key
#### Description
This SQL command removes a unique constraint named `chunk_group_tracking_id_dataset_id_key` from the `chunk_group` table.

#### Internal Logic
The command uses the `ALTER TABLE` statement to modify the `chunk_group` table by dropping the specified constraint. The constraint name suggests it was enforcing uniqueness on the combination of `tracking_id` and `dataset_id` columns.

## Side Effects
- Removal of the `tracking_id` column will result in the loss of any data stored in that column.
- Dropping the unique constraint will allow potential duplicate combinations of `tracking_id` and `dataset_id` in the table, if these columns still exist in other parts of the schema.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a backup mechanism before running this migration to preserve any important data in the `tracking_id` column.
- If the `tracking_id` column is no longer needed in the entire application, ensure that all references to it in the codebase are removed to maintain consistency.
