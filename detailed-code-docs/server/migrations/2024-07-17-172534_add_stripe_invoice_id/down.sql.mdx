## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert changes made by a corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `stripe_id` column from the `stripe_invoices` table in the database.

## Table of contents
- SQL statement to alter table

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE stripe_invoices
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `stripe_invoices` table by removing a specific column.

#### Internal Logic
1. Identifies the `stripe_invoices` table
2. Uses the `DROP COLUMN` clause to remove the `stripe_id` column

## Side Effects
- Permanently removes the `stripe_id` column from the `stripe_invoices` table
- Any data stored in the `stripe_id` column will be lost
- Applications or queries relying on the `stripe_id` column may fail after this migration is applied

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a backup mechanism before dropping the column to preserve data if needed
- Implement checks to ensure the column exists before attempting to drop it to prevent errors
