## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for modifying the `stripe_invoices` table in the database. The migration adds a new `stripe_id` column to store Stripe-specific invoice identifiers and provides a mechanism to revert this change if needed.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory perform the following actions:

1. Add a new column: The "up" migration adds a `stripe_id` column to the `stripe_invoices` table. This column is designed to store Stripe-specific invoice identifiers, allowing for better integration with the Stripe payment platform.

2. Remove the added column: The "down" migration provides a way to revert the changes by removing the `stripe_id` column from the `stripe_invoices` table.

These migrations enable the application to associate Stripe invoice IDs with the existing invoice records in the database, enhancing the system's ability to track and manage payments processed through Stripe.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL command to add the `stripe_id` column to the `stripe_invoices` table. The command is:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE stripe_invoices ADD COLUMN stripe_id TEXT;
   ```

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL command to remove the `stripe_id` column from the `stripe_invoices` table. The command is:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE stripe_invoices DROP COLUMN stripe_id;
   ```

## Configuration
The migration files are named with a timestamp prefix (2024-07-17-172534), which likely corresponds to the date and time the migration was created. This naming convention is common in database migration systems to ensure migrations are applied in the correct order.

## Side Effects and Considerations

1. Data Persistence: When applying the "up" migration, any existing records in the `stripe_invoices` table will have a NULL value in the new `stripe_id` column unless populated manually.

2. Data Loss: When applying the "down" migration, any data stored in the `stripe_id` column will be permanently lost. It's crucial to back up this data if it needs to be preserved before running the "down" migration.

3. Application Impact: Any applications or queries that interact with the `stripe_invoices` table may need to be updated to account for the presence (or absence) of the `stripe_id` column, depending on which migration has been applied.

4. Performance: Adding a new column to an existing table with many records could potentially impact database performance temporarily during the migration process.

## Future Improvements

1. Column Constraints: Consider adding a NOT NULL constraint to the `stripe_id` column in the "up" migration if all invoices are expected to have a Stripe ID.

2. Indexing: If queries frequently search or filter by `stripe_id`, adding an index to this column could improve query performance.

3. Uniqueness: If `stripe_id` values are expected to be unique, adding a UNIQUE constraint to the column could help maintain data integrity.

4. Data Validation: Implement checks in the application layer to ensure that `stripe_id` values conform to Stripe's ID format before insertion.

5. Backup Mechanism: Implement a backup process before running the "down" migration to preserve `stripe_id` data if needed for future reference or rollback scenarios.

By implementing these migrations, the application gains the ability to associate Stripe-specific invoice identifiers with its internal invoice records, facilitating better integration with the Stripe payment platform and potentially enabling more advanced payment tracking and reconciliation features.
