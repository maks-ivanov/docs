## Table of contents
- ALTER TABLE statement

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE stripe_invoices
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `stripe_invoices` table by adding a new column.

#### Internal Logic
1. Targets the `stripe_invoices` table
2. Adds a new column named `stripe_id`
3. Sets the data type of the new column to TEXT

## Side Effects
- Modifies the schema of the `stripe_invoices` table
- May affect existing queries or applications that interact with this table

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a NOT NULL constraint if the `stripe_id` is required for all records
- Evaluate whether an index on the `stripe_id` column would be beneficial for query performance
- If `stripe_id` is expected to be unique, consider adding a UNIQUE constraint
