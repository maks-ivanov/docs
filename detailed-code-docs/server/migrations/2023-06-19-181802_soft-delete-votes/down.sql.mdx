title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `deleted` column from the `card_votes` table, effectively undoing a soft delete functionality.

## Table of contents
- ALTER TABLE statement

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE card_votes DROP COLUMN deleted
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `deleted` column from the `card_votes` table.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a direct SQL command)

#### Outputs
N/A (This command modifies the database schema)

#### Internal Logic
The command uses the `ALTER TABLE` statement to modify the structure of the `card_votes` table. The `DROP COLUMN` clause is used to remove the `deleted` column from the table.

## Side Effects
- Removes the `deleted` column from the `card_votes` table
- Any data that was stored in the `deleted` column will be permanently lost
- Applications or queries that relied on the `deleted` column will no longer function correctly

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a backup mechanism before running this migration to preserve any data in the `deleted` column
- Ensure that all application code that interacts with the `card_votes` table is updated to remove references to the `deleted` column
