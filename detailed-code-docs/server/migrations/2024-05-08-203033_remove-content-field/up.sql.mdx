## High-level description
This SQL migration script removes the 'content' column from the 'chunk_metadata' table in the database schema. It's part of a database schema modification to eliminate a potentially redundant or no longer needed field.

## Table of contents
- ALTER TABLE statement

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata DROP COLUMN content
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the 'chunk_metadata' table by removing the 'content' column.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a direct SQL command and doesn't take inputs in the traditional sense.

#### Outputs
N/A - This command modifies the database schema but doesn't return data.

#### Internal Logic
The command uses the ALTER TABLE statement to modify the 'chunk_metadata' table. The DROP COLUMN clause is used to remove the 'content' column from this table.

## Side Effects
- Permanently removes the 'content' column from the 'chunk_metadata' table.
- Any data stored in the 'content' column will be lost after this migration is applied.
- Queries or application code relying on the 'content' column will need to be updated to prevent errors.

## Future Improvements
- Ensure that all parts of the application that previously used the 'content' column are updated to reflect this change.
- Consider adding a corresponding down migration script to revert this change if needed.
- If the 'content' data is still needed but stored elsewhere, consider updating related documentation to reflect the new data structure.
