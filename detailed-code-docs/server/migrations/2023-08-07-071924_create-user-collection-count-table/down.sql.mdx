## High-level description
This SQL script is designed to undo the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` migration. It removes a trigger, a function, and a table related to user collection counts in a database system.

## Table of contents
- Drop trigger
- Drop function
- Drop table

## Symbols

### DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS update_collection_counts_trigger ON card_collection
#### Description
This command removes the trigger named `update_collection_counts_trigger` from the `card_collection` table if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the command doesn't throw an error if the trigger doesn't exist.

### DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS update_collection_counts()
#### Description
This command removes the function named `update_collection_counts()` if it exists in the database.

#### Internal Logic
The `IF EXISTS` clause prevents errors if the function is not present.

### DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_collection_counts
#### Description
This command removes the `user_collection_counts` table from the database if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
The `IF EXISTS` clause allows the command to execute without errors even if the table is not present.

## Dependencies
This script doesn't explicitly depend on external libraries, but it assumes the existence of certain database objects:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| card_collection table | The table on which the trigger was originally created |
| update_collection_counts_trigger | The trigger being dropped |
| update_collection_counts() function | The function being dropped |
| user_collection_counts table | The table being dropped |

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each drop operation.
- If there are any foreign key constraints or dependencies on the `user_collection_counts` table, consider adding commands to remove these constraints before dropping the table.
- If the order of operations is critical, consider adding comments to explain why this specific order is chosen.
