## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes a GiST index and the PostgreSQL trigram extension, effectively undoing the setup for trigram-based text search functionality.

## Table of contents
- Drop GiST index
- Drop PostgreSQL trigram extension

## Symbols

### DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_gist;
#### Description
This SQL command removes the GiST (Generalized Search Tree) index named `idx_gist` if it exists in the database.

#### Side Effects
- Removes the `idx_gist` index from the database, which may impact the performance of certain text search queries.

### DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS pg_trgm;
#### Description
This SQL command removes the PostgreSQL trigram extension (`pg_trgm`) if it exists in the database.

#### Side Effects
- Removes the `pg_trgm` extension, which disables trigram-based text search functionality in the database.
- May affect other database objects or queries that rely on trigram functionality.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| PostgreSQL | The database system where these SQL commands are executed |

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of removing these specific database objects.
- If there are any dependent objects or data that rely on the trigram functionality, consider adding steps to handle or clean up those dependencies before dropping the extension.
