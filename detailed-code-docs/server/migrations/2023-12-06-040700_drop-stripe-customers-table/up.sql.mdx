## Table of contents
- DROP TABLE statement

## Symbols

### DROP TABLE IF EXISTS stripe_customers
#### Description
This SQL command attempts to remove the `stripe_customers` table from the database. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the operation will not throw an error if the table doesn't exist.

#### Inputs
This command doesn't take any direct inputs.

#### Outputs
This command doesn't produce any direct outputs. However, it has the side effect of removing the `stripe_customers` table from the database schema if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
1. The database engine checks if a table named `stripe_customers` exists in the current schema.
2. If the table exists, it is permanently removed from the database, including all its data and structure.
3. If the table doesn't exist, the command completes successfully without making any changes.

## Side Effects
- Permanent removal of the `stripe_customers` table and all its data from the database, if it exists.
- Potential impact on any database objects (views, functions, etc.) that might have been dependent on the `stripe_customers` table.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a comment explaining why the table is being dropped, which could be helpful for future maintainers.
- If there are any foreign key constraints referencing this table, they should be dropped before dropping this table. A more comprehensive migration script might include these steps.
- After dropping the table, it might be beneficial to run a VACUUM command to reclaim storage space, especially if the table was large.
