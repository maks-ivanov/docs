## High-level description
This directory contains database migration scripts related to the `chunk_files` table. The scripts are written in SQL and are intended to be run sequentially to manage changes to the database schema.

## What does it do?
The scripts in this directory manage the lifecycle of the `chunk_files` table in the database. 

- The `up.sql` script **deletes** the `chunk_files` table. This means that all data in the table, along with its indexes and constraints, are permanently removed from the database.

- The `down.sql` script **recreates** the `chunk_files` table. This is essentially a rollback operation that restores the table to its state before the `up.sql` script was applied. The recreated table includes its columns, primary key, and foreign key constraints referencing the `chunk_metadata` and `files` tables. 

These scripts are typically used in conjunction with a database migration tool to manage schema changes in a controlled and versioned manner.
