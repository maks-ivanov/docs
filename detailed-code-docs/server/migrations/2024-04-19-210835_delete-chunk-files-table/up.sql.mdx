## High-level description

## Table of contents
- DROP TABLE statement

## Symbols

### DROP TABLE chunk_files
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `chunk_files` table from the database schema entirely, including all its data, indexes, and constraints.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
The `DROP TABLE` statement is executed by the database management system, which removes all data, indexes, triggers, constraints, and permission specifications for the table.

## Side Effects
- All data stored in the `chunk_files` table will be permanently deleted.
- Any views, triggers, or stored procedures that depend on the `chunk_files` table may become invalid or throw errors when accessed.
- Foreign key constraints in other tables referencing the `chunk_files` table (if any) will be affected and may need to be addressed separately.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a safety check before dropping the table, such as verifying if the table exists to prevent errors if the migration is run multiple times.
- If data preservation is required, consider adding a step to backup the data before dropping the table.
- If there are dependencies on this table, ensure that they are properly handled in related migration scripts or application code.
