## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for managing changes related to the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table. Specifically, it focuses on adding and removing a foreign key constraint linking this table to the `card_collection` table via the `collection_uuid` column.

## What does it do?
The scripts in this directory handle database schema updates related to file upload notifications. One script adds a link between file upload notifications and card collections, ensuring that each notification is associated with a specific collection. The other script reverses this change, removing the link and making the notifications independent of collections. This is essential for maintaining database integrity and reflecting changes in how the application handles file uploads and collections.

## Key Files
- **`2023-08-02-003642_add-collection-uuid-reference-to-file-notification/up.sql`**: This script modifies the database schema by adding a foreign key constraint to the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table. This constraint enforces that every file upload notification is associated with a valid card collection.
- **`2023-08-02-003642_add-collection-uuid-reference-to-file-notification/down.sql`**: This script reverts the changes made by `up.sql`. It removes the foreign key constraint, decoupling the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table from the `card_collection` table. This allows notifications to exist independently of collections.
