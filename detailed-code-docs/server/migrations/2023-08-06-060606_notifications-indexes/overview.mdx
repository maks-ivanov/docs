## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration files for creating and removing indexes on notification-related tables in the database. The migrations are designed to improve query performance for operations involving file upload and verification notifications.

## What does it do?
These migration files add and remove database indexes, which are data structures that enhance the speed of data retrieval operations on database tables. Specifically:

1. The "up" migration adds indexes to the following columns:
   - `user_uuid` and `collection_uuid` in the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table
   - `user_uuid`, `card_uuid`, and `verification_uuid` in the `verification_notifications` table

2. The "down" migration removes these same indexes.

These changes aim to speed up queries that filter or search notifications based on users, collections, cards, or verifications. This is particularly beneficial for large tables where such operations might otherwise be slow.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to create the new indexes. It's responsible for implementing the performance improvements.

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to remove the indexes created by `up.sql`. It's used to revert the changes if necessary.

Both files are crucial for managing the database schema and ensuring that changes can be applied or rolled back as needed.

## Performance Considerations

The addition of these indexes is expected to significantly improve read performance for queries that filter on the indexed columns. This is especially beneficial for tables with a large number of rows. However, it's important to note that while read operations will be faster, there might be a slight impact on write operations (inserts, updates, deletes) as the indexes need to be updated along with the table data.

The decision to add these indexes suggests that the benefits of faster read operations outweigh the potential slight decrease in write performance. This implies that these tables are more frequently read from than written to, or that read performance is more critical for the application's functionality.

When applying or reverting these migrations, especially in a production environment, it's crucial to:

1. Monitor query performance before and after the changes to ensure the expected improvements are realized.
2. Be aware of any temporary performance impact during the index creation or removal process, especially for large tables.
3. Ensure that the application's query patterns align with the added indexes to maximize their benefit.

Future improvements could include:
- Adding composite indexes if queries often filter on multiple columns simultaneously.
- Regularly analyzing table statistics to ensure optimal query planning.
- Monitoring index usage to confirm their effectiveness and adjust as needed.

By implementing these indexes, the database is optimized for faster retrieval of notification data, which should lead to improved overall application performance, especially for operations involving user-specific or entity-specific notification queries.
