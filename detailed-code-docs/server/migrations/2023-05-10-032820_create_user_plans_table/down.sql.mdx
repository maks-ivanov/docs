title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to undo the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` file. It drops the `user_plans` table and its associated index, effectively removing the user plans data structure from the database.

## Table of contents
- Drop `user_plans` table
- Drop index on `stripe_customer_id`

## Symbols

### DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_plans
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `user_plans` table from the database if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the command will not throw an error if the table doesn't exist, making the migration more robust and idempotent.

### DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_user_plans_stripe_customer_id
#### Description
This SQL command removes the index named `idx_user_plans_stripe_customer_id` if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the command will not throw an error if the index doesn't exist, making the migration more robust and idempotent.

## Side Effects
- Permanent deletion of the `user_plans` table and all its data
- Removal of the index on the `stripe_customer_id` column, which may impact query performance if the table is recreated without this index

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a backup mechanism before dropping the table to prevent accidental data loss
- If the application relies heavily on this table, implement a more granular migration strategy that allows for data preservation or transformation instead of complete removal
