## High-level description
This SQL script creates a `user_plans` table to store information about user subscriptions, including Stripe-related data, plan details, and status. It also adds an index on the `stripe_customer_id` column for improved query performance.

## Table of contents
- Table creation: `user_plans`
- Index creation: `idx_user_plans_stripe_customer_id`

## Code Structure
The script consists of two main SQL statements: one for creating the `user_plans` table and another for creating an index on the `stripe_customer_id` column.

## Symbols

### CREATE TABLE user_plans
#### Description
This SQL statement creates a new table named `user_plans` to store information about user subscription plans.

#### Internal Logic
The table is created with the following columns:
1. `id`: A unique UUID serving as the primary key
2. `stripe_customer_id`: A unique text field for storing Stripe customer IDs
3. `stripe_subscription_id`: A unique text field for storing Stripe subscription IDs
4. `plan`: A text field to store the plan type
5. `status`: A text field to store the subscription status
6. `created_at`: A timestamp for when the record was created
7. `updated_at`: A timestamp for when the record was last updated

All columns are defined as NOT NULL, ensuring that they always contain a value.

### CREATE INDEX idx_user_plans_stripe_customer_id
#### Description
This SQL statement creates an index on the `stripe_customer_id` column of the `user_plans` table.

#### Internal Logic
The index is created to improve query performance when searching or filtering by `stripe_customer_id`.

## Performance Considerations
The addition of an index on `stripe_customer_id` suggests that this column is frequently used in queries, and the index will help improve the performance of these queries.

## Future Improvements
1. Consider adding foreign key constraints if the `user_plans` table is related to other tables in the database.
2. Depending on the application's needs, additional indexes might be beneficial, such as on the `plan` or `status` columns if they are frequently used in queries.
3. If the application requires tracking historical data, consider implementing a separate table for storing subscription history or adding columns to track changes over time.
