## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert changes made to the `dataset_tags` table, specifically removing a unique constraint and adding two separate unique constraints. It's part of a database migration system, likely used to manage schema changes in a version-controlled manner.

## Table of contents
- Drop unique constraint on dataset_id and tag
- Add unique constraint on id and dataset_id
- Add unique constraint on tag

## Code Structure
The script consists of three SQL ALTER TABLE statements, each modifying the `dataset_tags` table structure.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE dataset_tags DROP CONSTRAINT
#### Description
This statement removes the unique constraint named `dataset_tags_dataset_id_tag_key` from the `dataset_tags` table if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement doesn't fail if the constraint doesn't exist.

### ALTER TABLE dataset_tags ADD CONSTRAINT dataset_tags_id_dataset_id
#### Description
This statement adds a new unique constraint named `dataset_tags_id_dataset_id` to the `dataset_tags` table, ensuring that the combination of `id` and `dataset_id` columns is unique.

### ALTER TABLE dataset_tags ADD CONSTRAINT dataset_tags_tag
#### Description
This statement adds another unique constraint named `dataset_tags_tag` to the `dataset_tags` table, ensuring that the `tag` column contains only unique values.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| SQL Database | The script is designed to be executed on a SQL database that supports ALTER TABLE statements and constraints. |

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding error handling or logging to capture any issues that might occur during the execution of these statements.
- If the database system supports it, consider using transactional DDL to ensure atomicity of these changes.
- Depending on the size of the `dataset_tags` table, adding these constraints might require careful consideration of performance impacts. Future improvements could include optimizing the table or indexes before adding constraints.
