## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert changes made to the `chunk_metadata` table, specifically removing a numeric column and its associated index. It's part of a database migration system, likely used in a version control context for database schema changes.

## Table of contents
- Removal of `num_value` column from `chunk_metadata` table
- Removal of index `idx_num_val_chunk_metadata`

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata DROP COLUMN num_value;
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `num_value` column from the `chunk_metadata` table.

#### Side Effects
- Permanently removes the `num_value` column and all its data from the `chunk_metadata` table.
- May affect any queries or application code that relied on this column.

### DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_num_val_chunk_metadata;
#### Description
This SQL command removes the index named `idx_num_val_chunk_metadata` if it exists.

#### Side Effects
- Removes the specified index, which may impact query performance for operations that previously utilized this index.
- The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures the command doesn't fail if the index doesn't exist.

## Error Handling
The script uses the `IF EXISTS` clause for dropping the index, which prevents errors if the index doesn't exist. However, there's no explicit error handling for the column drop operation.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a transaction wrap to ensure atomicity of operations.
- Add error handling for the column drop operation to manage potential issues gracefully.
- Include comments explaining the purpose of these changes for better maintainability.
