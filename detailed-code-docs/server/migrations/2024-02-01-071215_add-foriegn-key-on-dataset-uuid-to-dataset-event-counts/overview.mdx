## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for modifying the structure of the `dataset_event_counts` table in a database. The migrations add and remove constraints to ensure data integrity and establish a relationship between the `dataset_event_counts` table and the `datasets` table.

## What does it do?
These migration scripts perform the following actions:

1. Add a foreign key constraint to link the `dataset_uuid` column in the `dataset_event_counts` table to the `id` column in the `datasets` table.
2. Create a unique constraint on the `dataset_uuid` column in the `dataset_event_counts` table to prevent duplicate values.
3. Set a NOT NULL constraint on the `dataset_uuid` column to ensure every row has a value for this field.
4. Provide a way to undo these changes by removing the foreign key and unique constraints.

These changes improve data consistency and enforce relationships between tables, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the database.

## Key Files
1. `up.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to apply the new constraints and modifications to the `dataset_event_counts` table.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE dataset_event_counts
   ADD CONSTRAINT dataset_event_counts_dataset_uuid_fkey
   FOREIGN KEY (dataset_uuid) REFERENCES datasets(id) ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE CASCADE;

   ALTER TABLE dataset_event_counts
   ADD CONSTRAINT dataset_event_counts_dataset_uuid_unique UNIQUE (dataset_uuid);

   ALTER TABLE dataset_event_counts
   ALTER COLUMN dataset_uuid SET NOT NULL;
   ```

2. `down.sql`: This file contains the SQL commands to revert the changes made by the `up.sql` script.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE dataset_event_counts DROP CONSTRAINT dataset_event_counts_dataset_uuid_fkey;
   ALTER TABLE dataset_event_counts DROP CONSTRAINT dataset_event_counts_dataset_uuid_unique;
   ```

## Configuration
The migration scripts use standard SQL syntax and do not require additional configuration. However, they assume the existence of two tables:

1. `dataset_event_counts`: The table being modified.
2. `datasets`: The table referenced by the new foreign key constraint.

It's important to note that these scripts should be run in a controlled environment, such as a database migration system, to ensure proper versioning and application of changes.

## Side Effects
Applying these migrations will have the following effects:

1. Enforces referential integrity between `dataset_event_counts` and `datasets` tables.
2. Prevents duplicate `dataset_uuid` values in the `dataset_event_counts` table.
3. Ensures that every row in `dataset_event_counts` has a non-null `dataset_uuid` value.
4. Enables cascading updates and deletes from the `datasets` table to the `dataset_event_counts` table.

When reverting these changes:

1. The foreign key relationship between the `dataset_event_counts` table and the `datasets` table through the `dataset_uuid` column will be removed.
2. Duplicate values in the `dataset_uuid` column of the `dataset_event_counts` table will be allowed.

## Future Improvements
Consider the following potential improvements:

1. Add an index on the `dataset_uuid` column if it's frequently used in queries to improve query performance.
2. Include a data cleanup step before applying the NOT NULL constraint in case there are existing NULL values in the `dataset_uuid` column.
3. Add comments in the `down.sql` script to explain which table the foreign key was referencing, for better context.
4. If there are any indexes related to these constraints, consider adding their creation in the `up.sql` script and dropping them in the `down.sql` script for a complete migration process.

These migration scripts provide a solid foundation for maintaining data integrity in the database, particularly in the relationship between dataset events and the datasets themselves.
