## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to undo the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes a foreign key constraint and a unique constraint from the `dataset_event_counts` table, specifically related to the `dataset_uuid` column.

## Table of contents
- Drop foreign key constraint
- Drop unique constraint

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE dataset_event_counts DROP CONSTRAINT dataset_event_counts_dataset_uuid_fkey
#### Description
This SQL command removes the foreign key constraint named `dataset_event_counts_dataset_uuid_fkey` from the `dataset_event_counts` table.

#### Internal Logic
The command uses the `ALTER TABLE` statement to modify the `dataset_event_counts` table structure. It then uses the `DROP CONSTRAINT` clause to remove the specified foreign key constraint.

### ALTER TABLE dataset_event_counts DROP CONSTRAINT dataset_event_counts_dataset_uuid_unique
#### Description
This SQL command removes the unique constraint named `dataset_event_counts_dataset_uuid_unique` from the `dataset_event_counts` table.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to the previous command, this uses the `ALTER TABLE` statement to modify the `dataset_event_counts` table structure. The `DROP CONSTRAINT` clause is used to remove the specified unique constraint.

## Side Effects
- Removes the foreign key relationship between the `dataset_event_counts` table and the table it was referencing (likely a `datasets` table) through the `dataset_uuid` column.
- Allows duplicate values in the `dataset_uuid` column of the `dataset_event_counts` table, which was previously enforced to be unique.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a comment explaining which table the foreign key was referencing, for better context.
- If there are any indexes related to these constraints, consider dropping them as well for a complete rollback.
