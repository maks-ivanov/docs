## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to undo the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes a unique constraint from the `chunk_group_bookmarks` table, specifically the constraint on the combination of `group_id` and `chunk_metadata_id` columns.

## Table of contents
- SQL command to drop constraint

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE chunk_group_bookmarks
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `chunk_group_bookmarks` table by removing a constraint.

#### Internal Logic
1. Identifies the `chunk_group_bookmarks` table
2. Removes the constraint named `group_id_chunk_metadata_id_key`

### DROP CONSTRAINT group_id_chunk_metadata_id_key
#### Description
This clause specifies the constraint to be removed from the table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| group_id_chunk_metadata_id_key | Constraint name | The name of the constraint being dropped |

## Side Effects
- Removes the unique constraint on the combination of `group_id` and `chunk_metadata_id` columns in the `chunk_group_bookmarks` table
- May allow duplicate combinations of `group_id` and `chunk_metadata_id` to be inserted into the table after this migration is applied

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a comment explaining why this constraint is being removed and any potential implications for data integrity
- If this migration is part of a larger schema change, ensure that related tables or constraints are updated consistently
