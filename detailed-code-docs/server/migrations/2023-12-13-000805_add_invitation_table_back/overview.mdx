## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for managing the `invitations` table in the database. The scripts handle both the creation and removal of the table and its associated columns and constraints.

## What does it do?
The scripts in this directory are used to manage the database schema related to user invitations. One script creates the `invitations` table, defining its columns and constraints, while the other script removes the table. These scripts are essential for setting up and modifying the database structure to support the application's invitation functionality.

## Key Files
### `up.sql`
This script creates the `invitations` table in the database. The table stores information about invitations sent to users, including the invited email address, the dataset being shared, and the invitation's status and expiration.

### `down.sql`
This script handles the rollback of the migration performed by `up.sql`. It drops the `invitations` table from the database if it exists. This ensures that the database schema can be reverted to its previous state if needed.
