## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to undo the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `invitations` table from the database if it exists.

## Table of contents
- DROP TABLE statement

## Symbols

### DROP TABLE IF EXISTS invitations;
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `invitations` table from the database schema if it exists. It's a safe operation that won't throw an error if the table is not present.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the command will not raise an error if the table doesn't exist in the database. This makes the migration script idempotent, allowing it to be run multiple times without causing issues.

## Side Effects
- Permanently removes the `invitations` table and all its data from the database if the table exists.
- If the table doesn't exist, the command will have no effect on the database structure.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a backup mechanism before dropping the table to prevent accidental data loss.
- If there are any foreign key constraints referencing the `invitations` table, those should be handled before dropping the table.
