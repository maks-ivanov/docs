## Table of contents
- ALTER TABLE statement

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE files
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `files` table by removing the `link` column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` statement is used to modify the existing `files` table.
2. The `DROP COLUMN` clause is used to remove the `link` column from the table.

## Side Effects
- This migration will permanently remove the `link` column and all its data from the `files` table.
- Any queries or application code that previously relied on the `link` column will no longer function correctly after this migration is applied.

## Future Improvements
- Ensure that any application code or database queries that reference the `link` column are updated accordingly after running this migration.
- Consider adding a backup mechanism before running this migration to preserve the data in the `link` column if it might be needed in the future.
