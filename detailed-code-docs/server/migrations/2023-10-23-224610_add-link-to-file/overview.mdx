## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding and removing a 'link' column from the 'files' table in the database. 

## What does it do?
The `up.sql` script adds a new column named 'link' to the 'files' table. This column is designed to store text data, can be left empty, and defaults to NULL. 

The `down.sql` script reverts this change by removing the 'link' column from the 'files' table. This action is permanent and will delete all data stored in the 'link' column.
