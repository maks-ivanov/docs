## High-level description
This SQL script is a database migration file designed to revert changes made in a corresponding `up.sql` file. It adds back the `author_id` column to the `chunk_metadata` table and reestablishes foreign key constraints for several tables that reference the `users` table.

## Table of contents
- Add `author_id` column to `chunk_metadata` table
- Add foreign key constraints to:
  - `user_organizations` table
  - `user_api_key` table
  - `files` table
  - `topics` table

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata
#### Description
This statement adds the `author_id` column back to the `chunk_metadata` table.

#### Internal Logic
- Adds a new column named `author_id` of type UUID
- Sets the column as NOT NULL
- Creates a foreign key reference to the `id` column in the `users` table

### ALTER TABLE user_organizations
#### Description
This statement adds a foreign key constraint to the `user_organizations` table.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a foreign key constraint named `fk_user_id`
- Links the `user_id` column to the `id` column in the `users` table
- Specifies ON DELETE CASCADE behavior

### ALTER TABLE user_api_key
#### Description
This statement adds a foreign key constraint to the `user_api_key` table.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a foreign key constraint named `user_api_key_user_id_fkey`
- Links the `user_id` column to the `id` column in the `users` table
- Specifies ON DELETE CASCADE behavior

### ALTER TABLE files
#### Description
This statement adds a foreign key constraint to the `files` table.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a foreign key constraint named `files_user_id_fkey`
- Links the `user_id` column to the `id` column in the `users` table
- Specifies ON DELETE CASCADE behavior

### ALTER TABLE topics
#### Description
This statement adds a foreign key constraint to the `topics` table.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a foreign key constraint named `topics_user_id_fkey`
- Links the `user_id` column to the `id` column in the `users` table
- Specifies ON DELETE CASCADE behavior

## Side Effects
- The `chunk_metadata` table will have a new column `author_id` added, which may affect existing queries or data operations.
- The added foreign key constraints will enforce referential integrity between the modified tables and the `users` table.
- The CASCADE delete behavior will cause related records in the child tables to be automatically deleted when a user is deleted from the `users` table.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding indexes on the foreign key columns if they are frequently used in queries to improve performance.
- Evaluate the impact of CASCADE delete operations on data integrity and consider using alternative strategies like soft deletes if data preservation is critical.
- If the database grows large, consider the performance impact of adding these constraints and plan for any necessary database maintenance or optimization.
