## High-level description
This directory contains database migration files related to the `author_id` column in the `chunk_metadata` table. The migration aims to remove the `author_id` column and update foreign key constraints in related tables.

## What does it do?
The migration script `up.sql` removes the `author_id` column from the `chunk_metadata` table and updates foreign key constraints on several other tables (`user_organizations`, `user_api_key`, `files`, and `topics`). These updates ensure cascading updates and deletes from the `users` table to the related tables.

The `down.sql` script reverts these changes. It adds back the `author_id` column to the `chunk_metadata` table and re-establishes the original foreign key constraints.

Essentially, this migration changes how authorship is tracked within the database, decoupling it from the `chunk_metadata` table and relying on cascading actions from the `users` table.
