## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration files for managing the `user_plans` table in the database. It includes two files: `up.sql` for applying the migration and `down.sql` for reverting it.

## What does it do?
The migration files in this directory handle the removal and restoration of the `user_plans` table, which stores information about user subscriptions. The `up.sql` script drops the table and its associated index, effectively deleting the table and its data from the database. Conversely, the `down.sql` script recreates the `user_plans` table and its index, effectively restoring the table structure. This mechanism allows for controlled and reversible changes to the database schema during development or deployment.
