## High-level description
This SQL migration script removes the `user_plans` table and its associated index from the database schema. It's designed to be idempotent, meaning it can be run multiple times without causing errors.

## Table of contents
- Drop `user_plans` table
- Drop index on `stripe_customer_id`

## Symbols

### DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_plans
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `user_plans` table from the database if it exists. If the table doesn't exist, the command will not throw an error.

#### Internal Logic
The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the command will not fail if the table is not present in the database. This makes the migration script more robust and allows it to be run multiple times without issues.

### DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_user_plans_stripe_customer_id
#### Description
This SQL command removes an index named `idx_user_plans_stripe_customer_id` if it exists. This index was likely associated with the `user_plans` table that is being dropped.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to the table drop command, the `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the command will not fail if the index is not present in the database. This allows for idempotent execution of the migration script.

## Side Effects
- Permanent removal of the `user_plans` table and all its data
- Removal of the `idx_user_plans_stripe_customer_id` index, which may impact query performance if it was previously used

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a comment explaining why the `user_plans` table and its index are being removed
- If this change is part of a larger restructuring, ensure that any dependent tables or application code are updated accordingly
- If there's valuable data in the `user_plans` table, consider adding a data migration step to preserve or transform the data before dropping the table
