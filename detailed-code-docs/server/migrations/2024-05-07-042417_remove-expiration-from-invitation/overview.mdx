## High-level description
This directory contains database migration scripts for removing the expiration functionality from invitations. It includes two SQL files: `up.sql` for applying the migration and `down.sql` for reverting it.

## What does it do?
The migration removes the `expires_at` column from the `invitations` table in the database. This means that invitations will no longer have an expiration date and will remain valid indefinitely. The `up.sql` script executes the column removal, while the `down.sql` script reverts this change by adding the `expires_at` column back to the table.
