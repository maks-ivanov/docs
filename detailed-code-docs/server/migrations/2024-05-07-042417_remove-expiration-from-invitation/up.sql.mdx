### ALTER TABLE statement
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the `invitations` table by removing the `expires_at` column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the existing `invitations` table.
2. The `DROP COLUMN` clause is used to remove the `expires_at` column from the table.

## Side Effects
- The `expires_at` column will be permanently removed from the `invitations` table.
- Any data previously stored in the `expires_at` column will be lost.
- Applications or queries that relied on the `expires_at` column will need to be updated to reflect this change.

## Future Improvements
- Ensure that all application code that previously used the `expires_at` column is updated to handle its absence.
- Consider adding a comment in the migration file explaining the reason for removing this column, which could be helpful for future developers.
- If there's a need to track when invitations were created without an expiration, consider adding a `created_at` column in a separate migration if it doesn't already exist.
