## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE files
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the existing `files` table by adding a new column.

#### Internal Logic
1. Targets the `files` table for modification.
2. Adds a new column named `oc_file_path`.
3. Sets the data type of the new column to TEXT.
4. Allows NULL values for the new column.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the schema of the `files` table.
- Existing rows in the `files` table will have NULL values in the new `oc_file_path` column.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a default value for the `oc_file_path` column if appropriate.
- If `oc_file_path` is expected to have a specific format, consider adding a CHECK constraint to ensure data integrity.
- Depending on the application's needs, an index on this column might be beneficial for query performance if it's frequently used in WHERE clauses or joins.
