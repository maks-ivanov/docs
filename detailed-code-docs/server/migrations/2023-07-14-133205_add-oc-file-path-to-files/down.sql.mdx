## Table of contents
- ALTER TABLE statement

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE files
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `files` table by removing a specific column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` statement targets the `files` table.
2. The `DROP COLUMN` clause is used to remove the `oc_file_path` column from the table.

## Side Effects
- This migration will permanently remove the `oc_file_path` column and all its data from the `files` table.
- Any queries or application code relying on the `oc_file_path` column will need to be updated to avoid errors.

## Future Improvements
- Ensure that any application code or queries referencing the `oc_file_path` column are updated before running this migration.
- Consider adding a backup mechanism to preserve the data in the `oc_file_path` column before dropping it, if the information might be needed later.
