## High-level description
This directory contains database migration scripts for adding and removing the `oc_file_path` column in the `files` table. The `up.sql` script adds the column, while the `down.sql` script reverts this change.

## What does it do?
These SQL scripts manage changes to the database structure. The `up.sql` script adds a new column to store file paths in the `files` table. The `down.sql` script removes this column, effectively undoing the changes made by `up.sql`. This is useful for database version control and allows for easy rollback of changes during development or deployment.
