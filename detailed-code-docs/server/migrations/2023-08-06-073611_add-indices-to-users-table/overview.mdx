## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding and removing indices on the `users` table. These scripts are likely used as part of a database migration framework to manage changes to the database schema over time.

## What does it do?
The scripts in this directory manage database indices for the `users` table. Indices are like a table of contents for a database, allowing it to quickly find specific information. The `up.sql` script adds indices to speed up common lookups, like finding a user by their email address. The `down.sql` script removes these indices, which might be necessary to undo changes or revert to a previous database state.

## Key Files
- **`up.sql`**: This script adds indices to the `id`, `email`, `hash`, `username`, `website`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` columns of the `users` table. This is done to improve the performance of queries that search or filter data based on these columns.
- **`down.sql`**: This script removes the indices added by `up.sql`. It's used to revert the database schema to its previous state, effectively undoing the changes made by `up.sql`.
