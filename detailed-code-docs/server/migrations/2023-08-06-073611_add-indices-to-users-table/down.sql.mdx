## High-level description
This SQL script is designed to remove various indices from the `users` table in a database. It's a migration "down" script, intended to revert the changes made by a corresponding "up" migration that added these indices.

## Table of contents
- Remove index on id column
- Remove index on email column
- Remove index on hash column
- Remove index on username column
- Remove index on website column
- Remove index on created_at column
- Remove index on updated_at column

## Symbols

### `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_users_id`
#### Description
This SQL command removes the index named `idx_users_id` from the `users` table if it exists.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the command doesn't throw an error if the index doesn't exist.

### `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_users_email`
#### Description
This SQL command removes the index named `idx_users_email` from the `users` table if it exists.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the command doesn't throw an error if the index doesn't exist.

### `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_users_hash`
#### Description
This SQL command removes the index named `idx_users_hash` from the `users` table if it exists.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the command doesn't throw an error if the index doesn't exist.

### `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_users_username`
#### Description
This SQL command removes the index named `idx_users_username` from the `users` table if it exists.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the command doesn't throw an error if the index doesn't exist.

### `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_users_website`

## Side Effects
Executing this script will remove the specified indices from the `users` table, which may impact query performance on the affected columns.

## Performance Considerations
Removing indices can potentially slow down queries that were previously using these indices for faster data retrieval. However, it can also speed up insert, update, and delete operations on the table.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding comments explaining why each index is being removed, especially if there are specific performance or functional reasons.
- If the database system supports it, consider using a single command to drop multiple indices at once for better performance during migration.
- Implement a way to verify the existence of these indices before attempting to drop them, which could be useful for debugging or logging purposes.
