## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes a trigger and a function related to setting default organization usage data in a database.

## Table of contents
- Drop trigger
- Drop function

## Symbols

### DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS set_default_org_usage_data_trigger ON organizations
#### Description
This command removes the trigger named `set_default_org_usage_data_trigger` from the `organizations` table if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
- The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the command doesn't throw an error if the trigger doesn't exist.
- The trigger is specifically associated with the `organizations` table.

### DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS set_default_org_usage_data
#### Description
This command removes the function named `set_default_org_usage_data` from the database if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
- The `IF EXISTS` clause prevents errors if the function is not present in the database.
- No parameters are specified, indicating that the function is dropped regardless of its signature.

## Dependencies
This migration script doesn't rely on any external libraries or modules. It uses standard SQL commands supported by the database system (likely PostgreSQL, given the syntax).

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding comments to explain why these database objects are being removed.
- If there are any data implications from removing these objects, it might be beneficial to include data cleanup or transformation steps in this migration.
