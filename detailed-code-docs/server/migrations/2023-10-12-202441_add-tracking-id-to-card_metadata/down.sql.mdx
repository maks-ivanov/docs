## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `tracking_id` column from the `card_metadata` table in the database.

## Table of contents
- SQL statement to alter the `card_metadata` table

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE statement
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the `card_metadata` table by removing the `tracking_id` column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the `card_metadata` table.
2. The `DROP COLUMN` clause is used to remove the `tracking_id` column from the table.

## Side Effects
- Removing the `tracking_id` column will result in the loss of any data stored in that column.
- Any queries or application code that relies on the `tracking_id` column will need to be updated to avoid errors.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a backup mechanism before running this migration to preserve any important data in the `tracking_id` column.
- Ensure that all related application code and database queries are updated to reflect the removal of this column.
