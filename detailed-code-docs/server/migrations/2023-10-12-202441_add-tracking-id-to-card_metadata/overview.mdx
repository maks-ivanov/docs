## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding and removing a `tracking_id` column from the `card_metadata` table. 

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory manage changes to the database schema related to adding a unique tracking identifier to card metadata. The `up.sql` script adds a new column named `tracking_id` to the `card_metadata` table. This column is intended to store a unique identifier for tracking purposes. The `down.sql` script reverts this change by removing the `tracking_id` column. 

## Key Files
- `up.sql`: This script is executed to apply the migration, adding the `tracking_id` column.
- `down.sql`: This script is executed to revert the migration, removing the `tracking_id` column.
