## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for managing the `card_collection` table in the database. The `up.sql` script creates the table and defines its schema, while the `down.sql` script reverts these changes by dropping the table.

## What does it do?
These SQL scripts are used to manage database changes related to card collections. When applied, the `up.sql` script creates a new table to store information about collections of cards. This information includes details like the collection's owner, name, visibility settings, description, and timestamps for creation and modification. Conversely, the `down.sql` script undoes these changes by deleting the `card_collection` table and discarding all associated data. These scripts are essential for maintaining the database schema and ensuring that it aligns with the application's requirements.
