## High-level description
This SQL script is designed to revert the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` migration. It drops the `card_collection` table if it exists in the database.

## Table of contents
- Drop table statement

## Symbols

### DROP TABLE IF EXISTS card_collection
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `card_collection` table from the database if it exists. It's a safe operation that won't throw an error if the table doesn't exist.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the command will not raise an error if the table doesn't exist in the database. This makes the migration script more robust and idempotent.

## Side Effects
- Permanently removes the `card_collection` table and all its data from the database.
- Any dependent objects (like views or foreign keys) referencing this table may be affected or become invalid.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding statements to remove any associated sequences, indexes, or constraints if they were created separately.
- If there are any dependent objects, consider adding statements to drop or modify them before dropping the main table.
