## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to remove the `card_votes` table from the database if it exists. It's a simple, single-operation migration that ensures the table is dropped without causing errors if the table doesn't exist.

## Table of contents
- DROP TABLE statement

## Symbols

### DROP TABLE IF EXISTS card_votes;
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `card_votes` table from the database schema if it exists. The `IF EXISTS` clause prevents the statement from raising an error if the table is not present in the database.

#### Inputs
This statement doesn't take any direct inputs.

#### Outputs
This statement doesn't produce any direct outputs. However, it modifies the database schema by removing the specified table.

#### Side Effects
- Removes the `card_votes` table from the database if it exists.
- All data stored in the `card_votes` table will be permanently deleted.
- Any dependencies on the `card_votes` table (e.g., foreign key constraints, views, or triggers) may be affected or become invalid.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a comment explaining why the `card_votes` table is being dropped.
- If there are any dependencies on this table, ensure they are handled in subsequent migrations or in the application code.
- If this is part of a schema change, consider creating a corresponding "down" migration that would recreate the table if needed for rollback purposes.
