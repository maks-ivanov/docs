## High-level description
This directory contains database migration files related to the `card_votes` table. It includes two SQL scripts: `up.sql` for applying the migration and `down.sql` for reverting it. The migration aims to remove the `card_votes` table and its associated indexes from the database schema.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory manage changes to how votes on cards are stored in the database. The `up.sql` script removes the existing `card_votes` table, deleting all voting data. The `down.sql` script reverses this change by recreating the `card_votes` table and its indexes, effectively restoring the database to its state before the migration was applied. This allows for rolling back changes if needed.

## Key Files
- **up.sql:** This script drops the `card_votes` table if it exists. It's the primary action of this migration.
- **down.sql:** This script reverses the migration by recreating the `card_votes` table and its associated indexes. This ensures that the database can be reverted to its previous state.
