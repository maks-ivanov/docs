## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for removing and restoring a unique constraint on the `name` column of the `organizations` table. 

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory manage a database schema change related to organization names. One script (`up.sql`) removes a unique constraint, allowing duplicate organization names in the database. The other script (`down.sql`) reverts this change by adding the unique constraint back, ensuring that all organization names are unique.

## Key Files
- **up.sql:** This script removes the unique constraint called `organizations_name_key` from the `name` column of the `organizations` table. This allows for duplicate organization names in the database.
- **down.sql:** This script reverts the changes made by `up.sql`. It adds back the unique constraint `organizations_name_key` to the `name` column of the `organizations` table, ensuring that all organization names are unique.
