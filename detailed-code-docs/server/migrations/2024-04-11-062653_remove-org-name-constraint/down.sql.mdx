## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It adds a unique constraint to the `name` column in the `organizations` table.

## Table of contents
- SQL statement to add unique constraint

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE organizations ADD CONSTRAINT organizations_name_key UNIQUE (name)
#### Description
This SQL statement adds a unique constraint named `organizations_name_key` to the `name` column of the `organizations` table. This ensures that no two organizations can have the same name in the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organizations | table | The target table for the constraint |
| name | column | The column on which the unique constraint is applied |

#### Side Effects
- Enforces uniqueness of the `name` column in the `organizations` table
- May cause errors if duplicate names already exist in the table when applying this migration

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding error handling or a check for existing duplicate names before applying the constraint
- If organization names are case-sensitive, consider adding a case-insensitive unique constraint instead
