## High-level description
This SQL migration script removes the `client_configuration` column from the `datasets` table in the database schema.

## Table of contents
- ALTER TABLE statement

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE datasets DROP COLUMN client_configuration
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `datasets` table by removing the `client_configuration` column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` statement is used to modify the structure of an existing table.
2. `datasets` is the name of the table being altered.
3. `DROP COLUMN` is the specific alteration being made, which removes a column from the table.
4. `client_configuration` is the name of the column being removed from the `datasets` table.

## Side Effects
- The `client_configuration` column and all its data will be permanently removed from the `datasets` table.
- Any queries or application code that previously relied on the `client_configuration` column will need to be updated to avoid errors.

## Future Improvements
- Ensure that all application code and queries are updated to reflect the removal of the `client_configuration` column.
- If the data in the `client_configuration` column is still needed, consider creating a backup or moving it to another table before executing this migration.
- Review any indexes, constraints, or triggers that might have been associated with the `client_configuration` column and update or remove them as necessary.
