## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It adds a `client_configuration` column of type `jsonb` to the `datasets` table.

## Table of contents
- SQL ALTER TABLE statement

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE datasets ADD COLUMN client_configuration jsonb
#### Description
This SQL statement adds a new column named `client_configuration` to the `datasets` table. The column is of type `jsonb`, which is a binary JSON data type in PostgreSQL that allows for efficient storage and querying of JSON data.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a SQL statement, not a function)

#### Outputs
N/A (This is a SQL statement, not a function)

#### Internal Logic
1. The statement targets the `datasets` table.
2. It adds a new column named `client_configuration`.
3. The new column is of type `jsonb`, which allows for storing JSON data in a binary format.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the structure of the `datasets` table by adding a new column.
- May affect existing queries or applications that interact with the `datasets` table.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| PostgreSQL | This SQL script is designed for PostgreSQL databases, as it uses the `jsonb` data type which is specific to PostgreSQL. |

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a default value or constraints to the `client_configuration` column if needed.
- If this column is expected to be frequently queried, consider adding an index to improve performance.
- Ensure that any application code interacting with the `datasets` table is updated to handle this new column appropriately.
