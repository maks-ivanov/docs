## High-level description
This directory contains database migration scripts related to the `client_configuration` column in the `datasets` table. The `up.sql` script removes the column, while the `down.sql` script reverts this change.

## What does it do?
The scripts in this directory manage changes to the database structure. The `up.sql` script is executed when applying the migration, removing the `client_configuration` column from the `datasets` table. The `down.sql` script is used to revert this change, adding the column back to the table if needed. This allows for version control and rollback of database schema modifications.
