## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert changes made to the `card_collisions` table, specifically making the `collision_qdrant_id` column nullable again.

## Table of contents
- SQL ALTER TABLE statement

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE statement
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the `card_collisions` table by altering the `collision_qdrant_id` column to remove the `NOT NULL` constraint.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the existing `card_collisions` table.
2. The `ALTER COLUMN` clause specifies that we're changing the properties of the `collision_qdrant_id` column.
3. The `DROP NOT NULL` constraint removes the requirement for this column to always have a value, allowing it to be nullable.

## Side Effects
- This migration will allow NULL values to be inserted or updated in the `collision_qdrant_id` column of the `card_collisions` table.
- Existing data in the table will not be affected, but future operations can now include NULL values for this column.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a comment explaining why this column is being made nullable again, which could provide context for future developers.
- If this change is part of a larger feature or bug fix, it might be helpful to reference the related issue or pull request in a comment.
