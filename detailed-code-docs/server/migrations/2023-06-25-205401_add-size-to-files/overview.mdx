## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding a `size` column to the `files` table in the database. 

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory are designed to be run by a database migration tool. The `up.sql` script adds a new column named `size` to the `files` table. This column is intended to store file sizes as large integers. The `down.sql` script reverses this change by removing the `size` column from the `files` table.
