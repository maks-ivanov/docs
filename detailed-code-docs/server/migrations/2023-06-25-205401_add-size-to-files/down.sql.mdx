## Table of contents
- ALTER TABLE statement

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE files
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `files` table by removing the `size` column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` statement is used to modify the `files` table.
2. The `DROP COLUMN` clause is used to remove the `size` column from the table.

## Side Effects
- The `size` column and all its data will be permanently removed from the `files` table.
- Any queries or application code that relied on the `size` column will no longer function correctly after this migration is applied.

## Future Improvements
- Ensure that any application code or queries that used the `size` column are updated to handle its absence.
- Consider adding a backup mechanism before running this migration to preserve the `size` data in case it needs to be restored later.
