## High-level description
This SQL migration file creates three new indexes on the `created_at` columns of the `chunk_metadata`, `chunk_group`, and `files` tables. These indexes are designed to improve query performance for operations that filter or sort by the creation timestamp.

## Table of contents
- Create index on chunk_metadata.created_at
- Create index on chunk_group.created_at
- Create index on files.created_at

## Symbols

### `CREATE INDEX chunk_metadata_created_at_idx ON chunk_metadata (created_at);`
#### Description
This SQL statement creates an index named `chunk_metadata_created_at_idx` on the `created_at` column of the `chunk_metadata` table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| chunk_metadata | table | The table on which the index is being created |
| created_at | column | The column being indexed |

#### Outputs
An index is created on the specified table and column.

#### Performance Considerations
This index will improve query performance for operations that filter or sort the `chunk_metadata` table by the `created_at` column. However, it may slightly slow down insert and update operations on this table.

___

### `CREATE INDEX groups_created_at_idx ON chunk_group (created_at);`
#### Description
This SQL statement creates an index named `groups_created_at_idx` on the `created_at` column of the `chunk_group` table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| chunk_group | table | The table on which the index is being created |
| created_at | column | The column being indexed |

#### Outputs
An index is created on the specified table and column.

#### Performance Considerations
This index will improve query performance for operations that filter or sort the `chunk_group` table by the `created_at` column. However, it may slightly slow down insert and update operations on this table.

___

### `CREATE INDEX files_created_at_idx ON files (created_at);`
#### Description
This SQL statement creates an index named `files_created_at_idx` on the `created_at` column of the `files` table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| files | table | The table on which the index is being created |
| created_at | column | The column being indexed |

#### Outputs
An index is created on the specified table and column.

#### Performance Considerations
This index will improve query performance for operations that filter or sort the `files` table by the `created_at` column. However, it may slightly slow down insert and update operations on this table.

## Dependencies
This migration file depends on the existence of the following database tables:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| chunk_metadata | Table where the first index is created |
| chunk_group | Table where the second index is created |
| files | Table where the third index is created |

## Future Improvements
- Monitor the performance impact of these new indexes and adjust if necessary.
- Consider adding additional indexes on frequently queried columns if performance issues are identified in the future.
- Evaluate the need for composite indexes if queries often combine `created_at` with other columns.
