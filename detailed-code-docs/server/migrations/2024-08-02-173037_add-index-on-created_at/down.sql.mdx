## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to undo the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes three indexes that were previously created on the `created_at` columns of different tables in the database.

## Table of contents
- Drop index on chunk_metadata table
- Drop index on groups table
- Drop index on files table

## Symbols

### `DROP INDEX chunk_metadata_created_at_idx;`
#### Description
This SQL command removes the index named `chunk_metadata_created_at_idx` from the `chunk_metadata` table.

### `DROP INDEX groups_created_at_idx;`
#### Description
This SQL command removes the index named `groups_created_at_idx` from the `groups` table.

### `DROP INDEX files_created_at_idx;`
#### Description
This SQL command removes the index named `files_created_at_idx` from the `files` table.

## Side Effects
Removing these indexes will likely result in slower query performance for operations that were previously using these indexes, particularly for queries filtering or sorting on the `created_at` column of the affected tables.

## Performance Considerations
- Removing indexes will make certain queries slower, especially those that were utilizing these indexes for filtering or sorting on the `created_at` column.
- However, removing indexes can slightly improve the performance of INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations on the affected tables, as the database no longer needs to maintain these indexes.
- The overall impact on performance will depend on the specific query patterns and data volume in the application.

## Future Improvements
- Before applying this migration in a production environment, it's crucial to assess the impact on query performance, especially for frequently used queries involving the `created_at` column on these tables.
- If these indexes are found to be necessary for performance in certain scenarios, consider keeping them or creating more specific indexes tailored to the actual query patterns of the application.
- It might be beneficial to add comments explaining why these indexes are being removed, especially if there are specific reasons or if it's part of a larger optimization strategy.
