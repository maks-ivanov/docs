## High-level description
This directory contains database migration scripts for adding and removing indexes on the `created_at` columns of the `chunk_metadata`, `chunk_group`, and `files` tables. 

## What does it do?
The `up.sql` script creates indexes on the `created_at` columns of the `chunk_metadata`, `chunk_group`, and `files` tables. These indexes are designed to speed up queries that filter or sort data based on the creation timestamp. 

The `down.sql` script reverses the changes made by `up.sql`. It drops the indexes created by `up.sql`, reverting the tables to their previous state.

These scripts are intended to be run as part of a database migration process, allowing for controlled and reversible changes to the database schema.
