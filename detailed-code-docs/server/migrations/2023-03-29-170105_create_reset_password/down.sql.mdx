## High-level description
This SQL script is designed to revert the creation of the `password_resets` table in a database. It's a migration "down" script, typically used in database version control systems to undo changes made by a corresponding "up" migration.

## Table of contents
- DROP TABLE statement

## Symbols

### DROP TABLE IF EXISTS password_resets
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `password_resets` table from the database if it exists.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
The statement uses the `IF EXISTS` clause to prevent errors if the table doesn't exist when the script is run. This ensures that the script can be executed safely even if the table has already been dropped or was never created.

## Side Effects
- Permanently removes the `password_resets` table and all its data from the database.
- May affect any database objects (views, triggers, stored procedures) that depend on this table.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a backup mechanism before dropping the table to prevent accidental data loss.
- If there are any foreign key constraints referencing this table, include statements to drop those constraints before dropping the table.
