## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for managing the `password_resets` table in a PostgreSQL database. The scripts are designed to be used with a database version control system, allowing for controlled and reversible changes to the database schema.

## What does it do?
The directory contains two SQL scripts:

- `up.sql`: This script creates the `password_resets` table, which stores information about password reset requests. The table includes columns for storing the reset token, user email, expiration time, and timestamps for creation and updates.
- `down.sql`: This script reverts the changes made by `up.sql` by dropping the `password_resets` table. This ensures that the database schema can be rolled back to a previous state if needed.

These scripts work together to provide a way to manage the lifecycle of the `password_resets` table, allowing developers to safely create, modify, and delete the table as needed. 

The `up.sql` script defines the table structure with appropriate data types and constraints to ensure data integrity. It uses UUIDs for unique identification, enforces email uniqueness, and includes timestamps for tracking.

The `down.sql` script provides a safety net by allowing the changes to be reverted. It includes an `IF EXISTS` clause to prevent errors if the table doesn't exist, making it safe to run multiple times.
