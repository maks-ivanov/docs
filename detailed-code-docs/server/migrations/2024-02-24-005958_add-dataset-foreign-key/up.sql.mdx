## High-level description
This SQL migration script adds and updates foreign key constraints for various tables in a database, ensuring referential integrity with the `datasets` table and between related tables. It focuses on cascading updates and deletions to maintain data consistency across the database.

## Table of contents
- Dataset Usage Counts constraint
- Events constraint
- Chunk Metadata constraint
- Chunk Group constraint
- Files constraint
- Chunk Files constraints (for both files and chunks)
- Messages constraint
- Topics constraint

## Code Structure
The script consists of a series of `ALTER TABLE` statements, each following a similar pattern:
1. Drop the existing constraint (if any)
2. Add a new foreign key constraint referencing the `datasets` table or related tables

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE dataset_usage_counts
#### Description
Updates the foreign key constraint for the `dataset_usage_counts` table to reference the `datasets` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Drops the existing constraint if it exists
2. Adds a new constraint with cascading update and delete

### ALTER TABLE events
#### Description
Updates the foreign key constraint for the `events` table to reference the `datasets` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Drops the existing constraint if it exists
2. Adds a new constraint with cascading update and delete

### ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata
#### Description
Updates the foreign key constraint for the `chunk_metadata` table to reference the `datasets` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Drops the existing constraint if it exists
2. Adds a new constraint with cascading update and delete

### ALTER TABLE chunk_group
#### Description
Updates the foreign key constraint for the `chunk_group` table to reference the `datasets` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Drops the existing constraint if it exists
2. Adds a new constraint with cascading update and delete

### ALTER TABLE files
#### Description
Updates the foreign key constraint for the `files` table to reference the `datasets` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Drops the existing constraint if it exists
2. Adds a new constraint with cascading update and delete

### ALTER TABLE chunk_files (file_id)
#### Description
Updates the foreign key constraint for the `chunk_files` table to reference the `files` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Drops the existing constraint if it exists
2. Adds a new constraint with cascading update and delete

### ALTER TABLE chunk_files (chunk_id)
#### Description
Updates the foreign key constraint for the `chunk_files` table to reference the `chunk_metadata` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Drops the existing constraint if it exists
2. Adds a new constraint with cascading update and delete

### ALTER TABLE messages
#### Description
Updates the foreign key constraint for the `messages` table to reference the `datasets` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Drops the existing constraint if it exists
2. Adds a new constraint with cascading update and delete

### ALTER TABLE topics
#### Description
Updates the foreign key constraint for the `topics` table to reference the `datasets` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Drops the existing constraint if it exists
2. Adds a new constraint with cascading update and delete

## Side Effects
- Cascading updates and deletes: When a record in the `datasets` table is updated or deleted, the changes will propagate to all related tables.
- Potential data loss: If a dataset is deleted, all related records in the child tables will also be deleted due to the cascading delete.

## Performance Considerations
- The script may temporarily lock the affected tables during the constraint modifications, which could impact database performance during migration.
- After migration, the new foreign key constraints may slightly increase the overhead of insert and update operations on the affected tables.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding indexes on the foreign key columns if they don't already exist, to improve query performance.
- Evaluate the necessity of cascading deletes for all tables, as it might lead to unintended data loss in some scenarios.
- Consider adding a transaction wrapper around the entire migration to ensure atomicity of the changes.
