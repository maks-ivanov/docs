## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes three columns from the `users` table: `username`, `website`, and `visible_email`.

## Table of contents
- SQL ALTER TABLE statement

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE users
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the `users` table by removing three columns.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the existing `users` table.
2. Three `DROP COLUMN` clauses are used to remove the specified columns:
   - `username`
   - `website`
   - `visible_email`

## Side Effects
- This migration will permanently remove the `username`, `website`, and `visible_email` columns from the `users` table, along with any data stored in these columns.
- Any queries, views, or application code that relies on these columns will need to be updated to avoid errors.

## Performance Considerations
- Depending on the size of the `users` table and the database management system being used, this operation could potentially be time-consuming and may lock the table during execution.
- It's advisable to run this migration during a maintenance window or low-traffic period to minimize disruption to the application.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a backup mechanism before running destructive migrations like this one.
- If these columns might be needed again in the future, consider renaming or archiving them instead of dropping them completely.
