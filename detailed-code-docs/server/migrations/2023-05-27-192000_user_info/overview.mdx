## High-level description
The `/server/migrations/2023-05-27-192000_user_info` directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding and removing user-related information to the `users` table. The `up.sql` script adds columns for username, website, and email visibility, while the `down.sql` script reverts these changes.

## What does it do?
This directory manages a database migration. The migration adds three new pieces of information to each user in the database: username, website, and whether the user wants their email to be visible. The `up.sql` file contains instructions for adding these columns to the `users` table and populating them with initial values. The `down.sql` file contains instructions for undoing these changes, effectively reverting the `users` table to its previous state. 

For new users, the username is a unique text field, the website is a text field, and the email visibility is set to false by default. For existing users, the email visibility is set to true.
