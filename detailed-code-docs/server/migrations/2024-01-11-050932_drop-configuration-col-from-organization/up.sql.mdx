## High-level description
This SQL migration script removes the 'configuration' column from the 'organizations' table in the database schema.

## Table of contents
- SQL ALTER statement

## Symbols

### ALTER table organizations DROP COLUMN configuration
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the 'organizations' table by removing the 'configuration' column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of an existing table.
2. The table being altered is 'organizations'.
3. The `DROP COLUMN` clause is used to remove a column from the table.
4. The column being removed is named 'configuration'.

## Side Effects
- The 'configuration' column and all its data will be permanently removed from the 'organizations' table.
- Any queries or application code that previously relied on the 'configuration' column will need to be updated to avoid errors.

## Future Improvements
- Ensure that all application code and queries are updated to reflect this schema change.
- Consider adding a comment explaining why the 'configuration' column was removed for future reference.
- If the data in the 'configuration' column is still needed, consider creating a backup or moving it to another table before executing this migration.
