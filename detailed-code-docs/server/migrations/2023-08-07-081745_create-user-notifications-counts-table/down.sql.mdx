## High-level description
This SQL script is designed to undo the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` migration. It removes triggers, a function, and a table related to user notification counts in a database system.

## Table of contents
- Drop triggers
- Drop function
- Drop table

## Symbols

### Drop Triggers
#### Description
This section removes two triggers from the database:
1. `update_verification_notification_count` on the `verification_notifications` table
2. `update_file_upload_notification_count` on the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table

#### Internal Logic
The script uses the `DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS` command to remove the triggers if they exist. This ensures that the script can be run multiple times without causing errors if the triggers have already been removed.

### Drop Function
#### Description
This section removes the `update_notification_count()` function from the database.

#### Internal Logic
The script uses the `DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS` command to remove the function if it exists. This ensures that the script can be run multiple times without causing errors if the function has already been removed.

### Drop Table
#### Description
This section removes the `user_notification_counts` table from the database.

#### Internal Logic
The script uses the `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` command to remove the table if it exists. This ensures that the script can be run multiple times without causing errors if the table has already been removed.

## Side Effects
- Removal of triggers that were updating notification counts
- Removal of a function that was likely used by the triggers to update notification counts
- Removal of a table that was storing user notification counts

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each dropped object for better maintainability
- If there are any dependencies on these objects in other parts of the system, ensure they are handled appropriately when running this migration
