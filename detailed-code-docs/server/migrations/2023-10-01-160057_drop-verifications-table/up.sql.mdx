## High-level description
This SQL migration script removes two tables from the database: `verification_notifications` and `card_verification`. It's designed to clean up the database schema by dropping these tables if they exist.

## Table of contents
- Drop `verification_notifications` table
- Drop `card_verification` table

## Symbols

### DROP TABLE IF EXISTS verification_notifications
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `verification_notifications` table from the database if it exists.

#### Side Effects
- If the `verification_notifications` table exists, it will be permanently deleted along with all its data.
- If the table doesn't exist, the command will have no effect.

### DROP TABLE IF EXISTS card_verification
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `card_verification` table from the database if it exists.

#### Side Effects
- If the `card_verification` table exists, it will be permanently deleted along with all its data.
- If the table doesn't exist, the command will have no effect.

## Error Handling
The `IF EXISTS` clause in both DROP TABLE statements ensures that no error is raised if the tables don't exist. This makes the migration script more robust and idempotent.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding comments explaining why these tables are being dropped, which could provide context for future developers.
- If these tables are referenced by other tables or have foreign key constraints, ensure that those references are removed in the correct order to avoid dependency issues.
- If there's valuable data in these tables that needs to be preserved, consider creating a data migration script to move the data to other tables before dropping these.
