## High-level description
This directory contains database migration scripts for dropping the `verification_notifications` and `card_verification` tables. The `up.sql` script handles the removal of the tables, while the `down.sql` script reverts these changes by recreating the tables and their associated constraints.

## What does it do?
The scripts in this directory manage a database schema change related to card verification data. The `up.sql` script removes the `verification_notifications` and `card_verification` tables, effectively deleting any existing card verification data and functionality. The `down.sql` script reverses this process, recreating the tables and their constraints to restore the database to its previous state. This allows for rolling back the migration if needed. 

The `verification_notifications` table likely stored information about notifications sent to users regarding card verification attempts, including details like the user, card, verification attempt, and whether the user had read the notification. The `card_verification` table likely stored data about individual card verification attempts, such as the card being verified, a similarity score indicating the confidence of the verification, and timestamps.

These scripts are typically used in conjunction with a database migration tool that applies the changes in a controlled manner.
