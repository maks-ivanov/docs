## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for changing the data type of the `file_storage` column in the `stripe_plans` and `organization_usage_counts` tables. The `up.sql` script modifies the column type from INTEGER to BIGINT, while the `down.sql` script reverts this change.

## What does it do?
The scripts in this directory manage a database schema alteration related to how file storage sizes are represented. The `up.sql` script expands the storage capacity by changing the `file_storage` column to `BIGINT`, accommodating larger values. Conversely, the `down.sql` script reverses this change, reverting the column back to the `INTEGER` type. This might be necessary for compatibility reasons or to undo the effects of the `up.sql` migration. 

These scripts are likely executed as part of a larger database migration process, ensuring the database schema remains consistent with the application's requirements.
