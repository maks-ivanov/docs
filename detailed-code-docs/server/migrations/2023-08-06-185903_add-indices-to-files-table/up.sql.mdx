## High-level description
This SQL migration file adds several indices to the 'files' and 'card_files' tables to improve query performance. It creates indices on frequently accessed columns, which should enhance the speed of data retrieval operations.

## Table of contents
- Index creation for 'files' table
- Index creation for 'card_files' table

### CREATE INDEX statements
#### Description
These SQL statements create indices on specific columns in the 'files' and 'card_files' tables. Indices are database objects that improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional writes and storage space.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
For each CREATE INDEX statement:
1. Specify a unique name for the index (e.g., `idx_files_user_id`)
2. Indicate the table on which the index is being created (e.g., `ON files`)
3. Specify the column(s) to be indexed (e.g., `(user_id)`)

## Side Effects
- Improved query performance for SELECT operations involving the indexed columns
- Slightly increased storage space usage due to index data structures
- Potential slight decrease in performance for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations due to index maintenance

## Performance Considerations
- These indices will significantly improve the performance of queries that filter or sort by the indexed columns
- The database will need to maintain these indices, which may slightly impact write performance
- The choice of columns to index (user_id, private, created_at, updated_at for 'files', and card_id, file_id, created_at, updated_at for 'card_files') suggests these are frequently used in WHERE clauses or JOIN conditions

## Future Improvements
- Monitor query performance to ensure these indices are being utilized effectively
- Consider adding composite indices if queries frequently filter on multiple columns simultaneously
- Periodically review and potentially remove unused indices to optimize storage and write performance
