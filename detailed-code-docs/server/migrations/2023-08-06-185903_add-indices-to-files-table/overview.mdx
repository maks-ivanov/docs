## High-level description
This directory contains database migration scripts for adding and removing indices on the `files` and `card_files` tables. These scripts are likely used in a relational database management system to optimize query performance.

## What does it do?
The scripts in this directory manage database indices to improve the speed of data retrieval operations. One script adds indices to specific columns in the `files` and `card_files` tables, making it faster to search and filter data based on those columns. The other script reverts these changes, removing the indices. 

Think of it like adding a sorted index to a large book. The index lets you quickly find the pages containing information about a specific topic, rather than having to flip through the entire book. Similarly, database indices speed up data retrieval by providing a shortcut to find specific rows in a table.

## Key Files
- **`up.sql`**: This script adds indices to the `user_id`, `private`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` columns of the `files` table, and the `card_id`, `file_id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` columns of the `card_files` table. This aims to improve the performance of queries that filter or sort data based on these columns.

  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_files_user_id ON files (user_id);
  ```

- **`down.sql`**: This script reverts the changes made by `up.sql`. It removes the indices added to the `files` and `card_files` tables. This might be necessary to revert the database schema to a previous state or to address performance issues related to index maintenance.

  ```sql
  DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_files_user_id;
  ```
