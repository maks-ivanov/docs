## High-level description
This SQL script is designed to revert the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` migration. It removes a trigger named `update_event_count` from the `public.events` table.

## Table of contents
- Trigger removal

## Symbols

### `drop trigger if exists update_event_count on public.events;`
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `update_event_count` trigger from the `public.events` table if it exists.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
1. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the statement will not raise an error if the trigger doesn't exist.
2. The trigger named `update_event_count` is targeted for removal.
3. The `ON public.events` specifies that the trigger is associated with the `events` table in the `public` schema.

## Side Effects
- Removes the `update_event_count` trigger from the `public.events` table, which may affect any automated event count updates that were previously in place.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a comment explaining the purpose of the removed trigger for better context in the migration history.
- If there are any related functions or other database objects that were created alongside this trigger, consider removing them as well to ensure a complete rollback.
