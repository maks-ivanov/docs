## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for managing a database trigger associated with the `public.events` table. The scripts are responsible for creating and removing a trigger named `update_event_count`.

## What does it do?
These SQL scripts automate the process of adding and removing a database trigger that helps maintain the accuracy of an event count. When a new event is added, removed, or modified in the `public.events` table, the trigger automatically updates a corresponding event count, likely stored in a separate table or column. This ensures that the event count remains consistent with the actual number of events.

## Key Files
- **up.sql**: This script creates the `update_event_count` trigger. This trigger automatically executes a function called `update_notification_count()` whenever there are insertions, deletions, or updates to the `public.events` table.
- **down.sql**: This script reverts the changes made by `up.sql`. It removes the `update_event_count` trigger from the `public.events` table.
