## High-level description
This SQL script creates a trigger named `update_event_count` on the `public.events` table. The trigger is designed to automatically execute the `update_notification_count()` function after insert, delete, or update operations on the events table.

### `update_event_count` Trigger
#### Description
This trigger is set up to maintain the accuracy of an event count, presumably stored in another table or column. It fires after any insert, delete, or update operation on the `public.events` table.

#### Inputs
The trigger doesn't explicitly take inputs, but it operates on the `public.events` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. The trigger is activated after insert, delete, or update operations on the `public.events` table.
2. For each affected row, it executes the `update_notification_count()` function.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `update_notification_count()` function | This function is called by the trigger to update the notification count. Its implementation is not provided in this file. |

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding error handling within the `update_notification_count()` function to manage potential issues during the count update process.
- If performance becomes a concern with large numbers of events, consider implementing a batch update mechanism instead of triggering for each row.
- Ensure that the `update_notification_count()` function is optimized for quick execution to prevent delays in event insertions or updates.
