## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for managing the `tag_set` column in the `chunk_metadata` table. The scripts provide functionality for both adding and removing the column, allowing for flexible schema management during development or deployment.

## What does it do?
The SQL scripts in this directory are designed to be run by a database migration tool. They alter the structure of the `chunk_metadata` table, specifically focusing on the `tag_set` column. One script adds the column, while the other removes it. This allows developers to easily modify the database schema as needed, for example, to add or remove features related to tagging chunks of data.

## Key Files
- **`up.sql`**: This script removes the `tag_set` column from the `chunk_metadata` table if it exists. It's intended to be run when updating the database schema to a version that no longer requires this column.
- **`down.sql`**: This script reverts the changes made by `up.sql`. It adds the `tag_set` column back to the `chunk_metadata` table, restoring it to its previous state. This is useful for rolling back database changes or for development environments where schema flexibility is desired.
