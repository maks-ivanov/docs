## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `organizations` table and its associated index from the database schema.

## Table of contents
- Drop organizations table
- Drop index on organizations name

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS organizations;`
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `organizations` table from the database if it exists.

#### Side Effects
- Permanently deletes the `organizations` table and all its data
- Removes all constraints, triggers, and indexes associated with the table

### `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_organizations_name;`
#### Description
This SQL command removes the index named `idx_organizations_name` if it exists.

#### Side Effects
- Removes the index on the `name` column of the `organizations` table
- May impact query performance for searches or operations involving the `name` column

## Error Handling
The script uses `IF EXISTS` clauses to prevent errors if the table or index doesn't exist when trying to drop them.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a transaction wrapper to ensure atomicity of operations
- Add comments explaining the purpose of each drop operation for better maintainability
