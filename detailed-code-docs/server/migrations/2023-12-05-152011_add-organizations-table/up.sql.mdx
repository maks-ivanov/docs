## High-level description
This SQL migration script creates a new table called `organizations` and adds an index on the `name` column. The table is designed to store information about organizations, including a unique identifier, name, configuration, and timestamps for creation and updates.

## Table of contents
- Create `organizations` table
- Create index on `organizations.name`

## Symbols

### CREATE TABLE organizations
#### Description
Creates a new table named `organizations` to store organization data.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines columns for id, name, configuration, created_at, and updated_at
- Sets constraints for NOT NULL and UNIQUE where applicable
- Uses UUID as the primary key with a default value generated by `gen_random_uuid()`
- Uses JSONB data type for the configuration column
- Sets default values for created_at and updated_at columns

### CREATE INDEX idx_organizations_name
#### Description
Creates an index on the `name` column of the `organizations` table to improve query performance when searching or filtering by organization name.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| gen_random_uuid() | PostgreSQL function to generate random UUIDs for the id column |

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding additional indexes if query patterns suggest they would be beneficial
- If the configuration JSONB field has specific keys that are frequently queried, consider adding indexes on those keys
- Depending on the application's needs, consider adding a soft delete mechanism (e.g., a `deleted_at` timestamp column)
- If organization hierarchies are needed in the future, consider adding a self-referential `parent_id` column
