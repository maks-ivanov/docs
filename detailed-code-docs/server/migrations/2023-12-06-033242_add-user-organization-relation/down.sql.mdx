## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `organization_id` column from the `users` table if it exists.

## Table of contents
- SQL statement to drop the `organization_id` column

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS organization_id
#### Description
This SQL statement alters the `users` table by removing the `organization_id` column if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of the `users` table.
2. `DROP COLUMN` specifies that a column should be removed from the table.
3. `IF EXISTS` is used to prevent errors if the column doesn't exist, making the migration more robust.
4. `organization_id` is the name of the column being removed.

## Side Effects
- Removes the `organization_id` column from the `users` table, potentially affecting any queries or application logic that relied on this column.
- Data stored in the `organization_id` column will be permanently lost when this migration is executed.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a backup mechanism to preserve the data in the `organization_id` column before dropping it, if the data might be needed later.
- If there are foreign key constraints or indexes related to the `organization_id` column, they should be dropped explicitly before dropping the column to ensure a clean rollback.
