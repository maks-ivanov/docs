## High-level description
This SQL migration script adds an organization relationship to the users table by introducing a new column and a foreign key constraint. It establishes a many-to-one relationship between users and organizations.

## Table of contents
- Add organization_id column to users table
- Add foreign key constraint to users table

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN organization_id UUID NOT NULL
#### Description
This SQL command adds a new column named `organization_id` to the `users` table. The column is of type UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) and is set as NOT NULL, meaning it must have a value for every row.

#### Internal Logic
- Alters the existing `users` table
- Adds a new column named `organization_id`
- Sets the data type of the new column to UUID
- Enforces a NOT NULL constraint on the new column

### ALTER TABLE users ADD CONSTRAINT users_organization_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (organization_id) REFERENCES organizations(id)
#### Description
This SQL command adds a foreign key constraint to the `users` table, linking the `organization_id` column to the `id` column in the `organizations` table.

#### Internal Logic
- Alters the existing `users` table
- Adds a new constraint named `users_organization_id_fkey`
- Defines a foreign key relationship between `users.organization_id` and `organizations.id`
- Ensures referential integrity between the `users` and `organizations` tables

## Side Effects
- Existing rows in the `users` table will need to have a valid `organization_id` assigned, as the new column is set to NOT NULL
- Attempts to insert or update users without a valid `organization_id` will fail
- Deleting an organization from the `organizations` table may be restricted or cascade to related users, depending on the database's foreign key behavior settings

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding an index on the `organization_id` column in the `users` table to improve query performance when filtering or joining based on this column
- Evaluate whether a migration script is needed to populate the `organization_id` column for existing users
- Assess if any application code needs to be updated to handle the new organization relationship when creating or updating users
