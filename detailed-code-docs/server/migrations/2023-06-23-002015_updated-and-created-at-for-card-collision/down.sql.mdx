## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `created_at` and `updated_at` columns from the `card_collisions` table.

## Table of contents
- ALTER TABLE statement
- Column removals

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE card_collisions
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `card_collisions` table by removing two columns.

#### Internal Logic
1. Targets the `card_collisions` table for modification.
2. Removes the `created_at` column.
3. Removes the `updated_at` column.

## Side Effects
- Permanently removes the `created_at` and `updated_at` columns from the `card_collisions` table.
- Any data stored in these columns will be lost after executing this migration.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a backup mechanism before dropping columns to preserve historical data if needed.
- Implement a way to recreate these columns with their original data if the migration needs to be reverted.
