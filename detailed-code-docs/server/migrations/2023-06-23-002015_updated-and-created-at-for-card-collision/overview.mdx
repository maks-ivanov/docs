## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for the `card_collisions` table. The scripts manage the addition and removal of `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamp columns.

## What does it do?
The migration files in this directory are designed to be run sequentially by a database migration tool. The `up.sql` script adds `created_at` and `updated_at` columns to the `card_collisions` table. These columns automatically track when a record is created or modified. Conversely, the `down.sql` script reverts these changes by removing the added columns and any data they contain. This allows for version control and rollback of database schema changes. 

```sql
-- server/migrations/2023-06-23-002015_updated-and-created-at-for-card-collision/up.sql
ALTER TABLE card_collisions
    ADD COLUMN created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    ADD COLUMN updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW();
```

```sql
-- server/migrations/2023-06-23-002015_updated-and-created-at-for-card-collision/down.sql
ALTER TABLE card_collisions
    DROP COLUMN created_at,
    DROP COLUMN updated_at;
```
