## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert changes made to the `invitations` table by removing the `role` column if it exists. It serves as the "down" migration, undoing the changes implemented in the corresponding "up" migration.

### ALTER TABLE statement
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the `invitations` table by removing the `role` column if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the `invitations` table.
2. The `DROP COLUMN` clause is used to remove the `role` column.
3. The `IF EXISTS` condition is added to prevent errors if the column doesn't exist.

## Side Effects
- Removes the `role` column from the `invitations` table if it exists.
- If the column doesn't exist, the statement will not cause an error and will effectively do nothing.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a comment explaining the purpose of the `role` column that was removed, for better context in the future.
- If there are any foreign key constraints or indexes related to the `role` column, they should be dropped before removing the column. This script could be expanded to include those operations if necessary.
