## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding and removing a `role` column in the `invitations` table. The `up.sql` script adds the column, while the `down.sql` script reverts this change.

## What does it do?
The scripts in this directory manage changes to the database structure related to user invitations. The `up.sql` script modifies the database to include a new `role` column in the `invitations` table. This column likely defines the role a user will have upon accepting an invitation. The `down.sql` script undoes this change, removing the `role` column and reverting the `invitations` table to its previous state.
