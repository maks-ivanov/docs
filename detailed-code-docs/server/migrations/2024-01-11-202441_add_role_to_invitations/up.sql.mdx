## Table of contents

### ALTER TABLE statement
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the existing 'invitations' table by adding a new column.

#### Internal Logic
1. Targets the 'invitations' table
2. Adds a new column named 'role'
3. Sets the data type of the new column to integer
4. Makes the column NOT NULL (non-nullable)
5. Sets a default value of 0 for the new column

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the schema of the 'invitations' table in the database.
- Any existing rows in the 'invitations' table will have the new 'role' column populated with the default value of 0.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a CHECK constraint to ensure the 'role' column only contains valid values, if there's a predefined set of roles.
- If roles are meant to be human-readable, consider using an ENUM type instead of an integer, or create a separate 'roles' table and use a foreign key relationship.
- Add comments to explain the meaning of different role values (e.g., what role does 0 represent?).
