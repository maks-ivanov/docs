## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert changes made to the `messages` table, specifically undoing a modification to the foreign key constraint referencing the `topics` table. It removes a cascading delete constraint and replaces it with a standard foreign key constraint.

## Table of contents
- Drop existing foreign key constraint
- Add new foreign key constraint without cascade delete

## Symbols

### Drop existing foreign key constraint
#### Description
This SQL command removes the existing foreign key constraint named `messages_topic_id_fkey` from the `messages` table if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
The `DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS` clause is used to ensure that the operation is idempotent, meaning it can be run multiple times without causing an error if the constraint doesn't exist.

### Add new foreign key constraint
#### Description
This SQL command adds a new foreign key constraint to the `messages` table, linking the `topic_id` column to the `id` column in the `topics` table.

#### Internal Logic
The `ADD CONSTRAINT` clause creates a new constraint named `messages_topic_id_fkey`. This constraint establishes a relationship between the `messages` and `topics` tables without specifying any cascading behavior.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the structure of the `messages` table by changing its relationship with the `topics` table.
- Removes any cascading delete behavior that may have been present in the previous constraint.
- May impact data integrity and deletion behavior in the application using these tables.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding comments to explain why the cascade delete is being removed, which could help future developers understand the reasoning behind this change.
- If there are other tables with similar relationships, consider creating a standardized naming convention for foreign key constraints across the database schema.
