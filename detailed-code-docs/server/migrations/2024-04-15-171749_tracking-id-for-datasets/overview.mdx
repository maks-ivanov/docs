## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding and removing a `tracking_id` column from the `datasets` table. The scripts are likely part of a database migration system used to manage schema changes in a version-controlled manner.

## What does it do?
The `up.sql` script adds a new column called `tracking_id` to the `datasets` table. This column is meant to store a unique identifier for tracking datasets. The script also creates a unique constraint to ensure that each combination of `organization_id` and `tracking_id` is unique. Additionally, it creates an index on the `tracking_id` column to speed up queries that use this column.

The `down.sql` script reverts the changes made by `up.sql`. It removes the `tracking_id` column and its associated index. This ensures that the database schema can be rolled back to a previous state if needed.
