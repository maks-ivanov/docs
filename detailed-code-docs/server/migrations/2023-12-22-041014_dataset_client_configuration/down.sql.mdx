## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert changes made to the `datasets` table, specifically undoing the addition of a `client_configuration` column and renaming the `server_configuration` column back to `configuration`.

## Table of contents
- Drop `client_configuration` column
- Rename `server_configuration` column to `configuration`

## Symbols

### DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS client_configuration
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `client_configuration` column from the `datasets` table if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the operation will not fail if the column doesn't exist, making the migration more robust.

### ALTER TABLE datasets RENAME COLUMN IF EXISTS server_configuration TO configuration
#### Description
This SQL command renames the `server_configuration` column back to `configuration` in the `datasets` table if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
The `IF EXISTS` clause is used to prevent errors if the column doesn't exist or has already been renamed.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding error handling or logging to capture any issues that might occur during the migration process.
- If there's a need to preserve data, consider adding steps to backup or transfer data from the dropped column before removing it.
