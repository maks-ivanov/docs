## High-level description
This SQL script is designed to undo the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` migration file. It drops the `card_verification` table if it exists in the database.

## Table of contents
- DROP TABLE statement

## Symbols

### DROP TABLE IF EXISTS card_verification
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `card_verification` table from the database schema if it exists. It's a safe operation that won't throw an error if the table doesn't exist.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the command will not raise an error if the table doesn't exist in the database. This is particularly useful in migration scripts to ensure idempotency and prevent errors during repeated executions.

## Side Effects
- Permanently removes the `card_verification` table and all its data from the database if the table exists.
- If the table doesn't exist, the command has no effect on the database.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a backup mechanism before dropping the table to prevent accidental data loss.
- If there are any foreign key constraints referencing this table, they should be dropped first to ensure a clean removal.
