## High-level description
This directory contains database migration scripts for managing the `card_verification` table. The scripts are written in SQL and are designed to be executed by a database migration tool. The `up.sql` script creates the `card_verification` table and its associated columns and constraints, while the `down.sql` script drops the table.

## What does it do?
The scripts in this directory manage the lifecycle of the `card_verification` table in the database. 

- **Creation:** The `up.sql` script creates the `card_verification` table. This table stores information about card verifications, including a unique ID for each verification, a foreign key reference to the associated card in the `card_metadata` table, and a similarity score. 

- **Deletion:** The `down.sql` script handles the removal of the `card_verification` table. It uses `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` to safely remove the table only if it exists, preventing errors during repeated migrations.

These scripts work together to ensure that the database schema can be easily and reliably updated or reverted as needed.
