## High-level description
This SQL migration file creates two new indexes on the `events` table to improve query performance for lookups based on `dataset_id` and `event_type` columns.

## Table of contents
- Creation of index on `dataset_id` column
- Creation of index on `event_type` column

## Symbols

### `CREATE INDEX idx_events_dataset_id ON events (dataset_id);`
#### Description
This SQL statement creates a new index named `idx_events_dataset_id` on the `events` table, specifically for the `dataset_id` column.

#### Internal Logic
The database engine will create a B-tree index structure for the `dataset_id` column, allowing for faster lookups and potentially improving the performance of queries that filter or join on this column.

### `CREATE INDEX idx_events_event_type ON events (event_type);`
#### Description
This SQL statement creates a new index named `idx_events_event_type` on the `events` table, specifically for the `event_type` column.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to the previous index, this creates a B-tree index structure for the `event_type` column, which can improve the performance of queries that filter or sort based on the event type.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding indexes can significantly improve query performance for SELECT operations that use the indexed columns in WHERE clauses or JOIN conditions.
- However, indexes may slightly slow down INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations as the index structures need to be maintained.
- The effectiveness of these indexes depends on the data distribution and query patterns. They are most beneficial for columns with high cardinality (many distinct values) and frequently used in queries.

## Future Improvements
- Monitor query performance to ensure these indexes are being utilized effectively.
- Consider creating composite indexes if queries frequently filter on both `dataset_id` and `event_type` simultaneously.
- Evaluate the need for additional indexes on other frequently queried columns in the `events` table.
- Periodically analyze and rebuild the indexes to maintain optimal performance as the table grows.
