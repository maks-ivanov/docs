## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding and removing indexes on the `events` table. These scripts are likely used as part of a database migration framework to manage changes to the database schema over time.

## What does it do?
The `up.sql` script creates two indexes on the `events` table: one for the `dataset_id` column and one for the `event_type` column. These indexes are designed to speed up queries that filter or sort data based on these columns. 

The `down.sql` script does the opposite: it removes the two indexes that were created by the `up.sql` script. This is useful for rolling back changes or reverting the database to a previous state.

Here's a breakdown of the SQL commands used in these scripts:

| File       | Command         | Purpose                                                              |
| ---------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| up.sql     | `CREATE INDEX` | Creates a new index on a table column.                             |
| down.sql   | `DROP INDEX`    | Removes an existing index from a table.                              |

The indexes themselves are likely implemented using a B-tree data structure, which allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of data.
