## High-level description
This directory contains database migration scripts for managing Stripe integration within the application. It includes SQL files for both upgrading and reverting changes related to Stripe plans and subscriptions.

## What does it do?
These SQL scripts are used to create and modify database tables that store information about Stripe plans and subscriptions. When a user upgrades to a paid plan, the application uses these tables to track their subscription details, including the chosen plan, billing information, and subscription status. The `up.sql` script creates the necessary tables and relationships, while the `down.sql` script reverts these changes, effectively removing the Stripe integration from the database schema.

## Key Files
### `up.sql`
This script creates two tables:
- **`stripe_plans`**: Stores details of available Stripe plans, including features like card count, storage limits, and pricing.
- **`stripe_subscriptions`**: Tracks individual organization subscriptions, linking them to specific Stripe plans and recording creation and update timestamps.

### `down.sql`
This script handles the rollback by dropping the `stripe_plans` and `stripe_subscriptions` tables. It effectively removes the Stripe integration from the database.
