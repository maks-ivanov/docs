## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration files for managing changes related to API key roles in the `user_api_key` table. The files use the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss_[migration_name]`, with separate files for applying (`up.sql`) and reverting (`down.sql`) the migration.

## What does it do?
The migration files in this directory specifically handle the addition and removal of a `role` column in the `user_api_key` table. 

- The `up.sql` file adds a new `role` column to the `user_api_key` table. This column is intended to store information about the role associated with a particular API key. It is defined as an integer with a default value of 0 and is set as non-nullable.

- The `down.sql` file reverts the changes made by `up.sql`. It removes the `role` column from the `user_api_key` table, effectively deleting all data stored in that column.
