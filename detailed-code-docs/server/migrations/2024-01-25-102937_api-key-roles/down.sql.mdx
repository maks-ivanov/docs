## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `role` column from the `user_api_key` table in the database.

## Table of contents
- SQL statement to drop the `role` column

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE user_api_key DROP COLUMN role
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `role` column from the `user_api_key` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of an existing table.
2. `user_api_key` is the target table being altered.
3. `DROP COLUMN` is used to remove a column from the table.
4. `role` is the name of the column being removed.

## Side Effects
- Removing the `role` column will permanently delete all data stored in that column for all rows in the `user_api_key` table.
- Any queries or application code that relies on the `role` column in the `user_api_key` table will need to be updated to avoid errors.

## Performance Considerations
This operation may take longer to execute on tables with a large number of rows, as it involves modifying the table structure.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a backup mechanism before running this migration to preserve the `role` data in case it needs to be restored later.
- If the `role` information is still needed but in a different format, consider creating a new table or modifying the schema to accommodate the data in a different way before dropping the column.
