## High-level description
This SQL script is designed to revert the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` migration. It removes a trigger, a function, and a table related to user collection counts in a database system.

## Table of contents
- Trigger removal
- Function removal
- Table removal

## Symbols

### DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS update_collection_counts_trigger ON card_collection
#### Description
This command removes the trigger named `update_collection_counts_trigger` from the `card_collection` table if it exists.

#### Side Effects
- Removes the automatic updating mechanism for collection counts when changes occur in the `card_collection` table.

### DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS update_collection_counts()
#### Description
This command removes the function named `update_collection_counts()` if it exists in the database.

#### Side Effects
- Removes the function that was likely used by the trigger to update collection counts.

### DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_collection_counts
#### Description
This command removes the `user_collection_counts` table if it exists in the database.

#### Side Effects
- Permanently deletes the table and all data stored in it related to user collection counts.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each drop statement for better maintainability.
- If there's a need to preserve data before dropping the table, consider adding a data export step before the drop operation.
