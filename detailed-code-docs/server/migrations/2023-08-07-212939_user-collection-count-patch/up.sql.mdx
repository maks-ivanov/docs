## High-level description
This SQL script implements a migration to create and manage a user collection count system. It sets up a table to store user collection counts, creates a trigger function to automatically update these counts, and initializes the counts based on existing data.

## Table of contents
- Drop previous objects
- Create user_collection_counts table
- Create update_collection_counts function
- Create update_collection_counts_trigger
- Initialize user_collection_counts data

## Code Structure
The script is structured in a sequential manner, first removing any existing objects, then creating new ones, and finally initializing data. The main components are the `user_collection_counts` table, the `update_collection_counts()` function, and the `update_collection_counts_trigger`.

## Symbols

### user_collection_counts
#### Description
A table that stores the count of collections for each user.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | UUID | Primary key, auto-generated |
| user_id | UUID | Foreign key referencing users table |
| collection_count | INTEGER | Count of collections for the user |

### update_collection_counts()
#### Description
A PL/pgSQL function that updates the `user_collection_counts` table when changes occur in the `card_collection` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. For INSERT or UPDATE operations:
   - Insert a new record or increment the count for the user
2. For DELETE operations:
   - Decrement the count for the user

### update_collection_counts_trigger
#### Description
A trigger that executes the `update_collection_counts()` function after INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations on the `card_collection` table.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the `user_collection_counts` table based on changes in the `card_collection` table.
- Initializes the `user_collection_counts` table with data from existing `card_collection` records.

## Performance Considerations
- The trigger operates on each row, which could impact performance for bulk operations on the `card_collection` table.
- The initial data insertion uses a subquery, which might be slow for large datasets.

## Future Improvements
1. Consider adding error handling within the `update_collection_counts()` function to manage potential issues like negative counts.
2. For large datasets, the initial data insertion could be optimized using batch processing or a more efficient query structure.
3. Implement a mechanism to periodically verify and correct the counts in case of any discrepancies that might occur due to concurrent operations or system failures.
