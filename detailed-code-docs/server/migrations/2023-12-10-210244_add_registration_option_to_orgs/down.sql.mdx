### ALTER TABLE statement
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `orgs` table by removing the `registerable` column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command targets the `orgs` table.
2. `DROP COLUMN` is used to remove the specified column.
3. `IF EXISTS` is added as a safeguard to prevent errors if the column doesn't exist.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the structure of the `orgs` table by removing the `registerable` column.
- If the column doesn't exist, the operation will not cause an error due to the `IF EXISTS` clause.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a comment explaining why this column is being removed for better context in the future.
- If there are any dependent views or indexes on this column, they should be dropped before removing the column.
