## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding and removing a `registerable` column from the `organizations` table. The `up.sql` script adds the column, while the `down.sql` script removes it.

## What does it do?
These scripts are used to manage database schema changes over time. The `up.sql` script modifies the database by adding a new column called `registerable` to the `organizations` table. This column indicates whether new users can register themselves to an organization. The `down.sql` script reverts this change by removing the `registerable` column. 

The migration scripts are intended to be run in sequence, ensuring the database schema is correctly updated or reverted as needed.
