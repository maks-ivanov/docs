## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for renaming the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table to `events` and changing its schema. The goal is to transition from a table dedicated to file upload notifications to a more generic events table.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory modify the database schema to rename a table and adjust its columns. One script handles the upgrade process, while the other handles the downgrade process, allowing for reversible changes to the database structure.

## Entry points
- `up.sql`: This script is executed to apply the migration, renaming the table and modifying its columns.
- `down.sql`: This script reverses the changes made by `up.sql`, restoring the original table name and schema.

The migration process involves renaming the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table to `events`, dropping the `user_read` and `group_uuid` columns, and adding `event_type` (VARCHAR(255)) and `event_data` (JSONB) columns. The `down.sql` script performs the inverse operations.
