## High-level description
This directory contains database migration scripts related to moving files under datasets. Specifically, it focuses on removing the `user_id` column from the `files` table.

## What does it do?
The scripts in this directory manage a database schema change related to file storage. The `up.sql` script removes the `user_id` column from the `files` table, indicating a shift away from associating files directly with users. This change suggests a move towards organizing files under datasets, which may have their own mechanisms for managing ownership and permissions. The `down.sql` script reverses this change by adding the `user_id` column back to the `files` table, allowing for rollback if necessary.
