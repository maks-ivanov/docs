## High-level description
This SQL migration script removes the `user_id` column from the `files` table in the database. It's part of a larger migration process, likely related to reorganizing file storage under datasets.

## Table of contents
- ALTER TABLE statement

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE files DROP COLUMN user_id
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `files` table by removing the `user_id` column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` statement is used to modify an existing table structure.
2. `files` is the target table being altered.
3. `DROP COLUMN` is the specific alteration being made, which removes a column from the table.
4. `user_id` is the name of the column being removed from the `files` table.

## Side Effects
- The `files` table will no longer have a `user_id` column after this migration is applied.
- Any existing data in the `user_id` column will be permanently deleted.
- Queries or application code that previously relied on the `user_id` column in the `files` table will need to be updated to reflect this change.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a corresponding `down.sql` migration to revert this change if needed.
- Ensure that any foreign key constraints or indexes involving the `user_id` column are also removed if they exist.
- Update application code to reflect the removal of the `user_id` column from the `files` table.
- If file ownership or user association is still required, consider implementing it through a different mechanism, possibly involving the mentioned datasets.
