## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to undo the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It adds a `user_id` column of type UUID to the `files` table.

## Table of contents
- ALTER TABLE statement

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE files ADD COLUMN user_id UUID
#### Description
This SQL command adds a new column named `user_id` of type UUID to the existing `files` table.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a DDL statement and doesn't take inputs in the traditional sense)

#### Outputs
N/A (This statement modifies the table structure but doesn't return data)

#### Internal Logic
The statement performs the following action:
1. Identifies the `files` table
2. Adds a new column named `user_id`
3. Sets the data type of the new column to UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)

## Side Effects
- Modifies the structure of the `files` table by adding a new column
- May impact existing queries or applications that interact with the `files` table
- Potentially increases storage requirements for the `files` table

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a foreign key constraint to link the `user_id` to a users table if it doesn't already exist
- Evaluate if an index on the `user_id` column would be beneficial for query performance
- If this column is meant to be non-nullable, consider adding a NOT NULL constraint and providing a default value or migration strategy for existing rows
