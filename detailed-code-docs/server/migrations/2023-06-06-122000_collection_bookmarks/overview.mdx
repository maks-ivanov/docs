## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration files for managing the `card_collection_bookmarks` table in the database. The `up.sql` file creates the table and its associated relationships, while the `down.sql` file reverts these changes.

## What does it do?
These migration files are used to manage changes to the database structure related to bookmarking cards within collections. The `up.sql` file sets up the table to store these bookmarks, linking cards and collections. The `down.sql` file removes this table and its data, effectively undoing the changes made by `up.sql`.

## Key Files
- **up.sql:** This file contains the SQL code to create the `card_collection_bookmarks` table. It defines the table structure, including columns for linking to collections and card metadata, as well as timestamps for tracking creation and updates.
- **down.sql:** This file contains the SQL code to drop the `card_collection_bookmarks` table. It's used to revert the database changes made by `up.sql`, effectively removing the bookmarking functionality.
