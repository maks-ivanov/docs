## High-level description

## Table of contents
- DROP TABLE statement

## Symbols

### DROP TABLE card_collection_bookmarks
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `card_collection_bookmarks` table from the database schema.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
The `DROP TABLE` statement is used to completely remove the `card_collection_bookmarks` table and all its associated data from the database.

## Side Effects
- Permanent deletion of the `card_collection_bookmarks` table and all its data
- Potential impact on any database objects (views, triggers, stored procedures) that depend on this table

## Dependencies
This migration script depends on the existence of the `card_collection_bookmarks` table in the database.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a check for table existence before dropping (e.g., `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS card_collection_bookmarks;`) to make the script more robust
- If there are foreign key constraints referencing this table, consider adding statements to drop these constraints before dropping the table
