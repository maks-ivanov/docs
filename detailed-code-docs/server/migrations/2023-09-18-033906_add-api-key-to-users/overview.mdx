## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding and removing an `api_key_hash` column to the `users` table in the database. 

## What does it do?
These scripts manage changes to the database structure related to storing API keys for users. The `up.sql` script adds a new column to the `users` table for storing hashed API keys, while the `down.sql` script reverts this change by removing the column. This allows for version control and rollback of database schema modifications.
