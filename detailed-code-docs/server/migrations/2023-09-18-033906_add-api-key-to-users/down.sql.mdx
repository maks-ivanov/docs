## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` migration. It removes the `api_key_hash` column from the `users` table in the database.

## Table of contents
- SQL statement to alter the `users` table

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE users
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the `users` table by removing the `api_key_hash` column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the existing `users` table.
2. The `DROP COLUMN` clause is used to remove the `api_key_hash` column from the table.

## Side Effects
- Removes the `api_key_hash` column from the `users` table, potentially causing data loss if the column contained any values.
- Any queries or application code relying on the `api_key_hash` column will no longer function correctly after this migration is applied.

## Performance Considerations
- This operation may temporarily lock the `users` table, which could impact database performance during the migration, especially if the table is large or frequently accessed.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a backup mechanism before dropping the column to preserve any important data.
- If the `api_key_hash` is used for authentication or other critical features, ensure that alternative methods are in place before applying this migration.
