## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for renaming database entities from using "collection" terminology to "group" terminology. It includes both an "up" migration to apply the changes and a "down" migration to revert them.

## What does it do?
These SQL scripts are designed to be run on a database to modify its structure. The "up" script renames tables and columns from "collection" to "group", adds a unique constraint, and updates a function to reflect these changes. The "down" script does the opposite, reverting the database back to using "collection" terminology. This is a common practice in software development to keep track of changes to the database schema over time.
