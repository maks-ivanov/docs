## High-level description
This SQL migration script removes a unique constraint from the `chunk_group` table in the database. Specifically, it drops the constraint named `chunk_group_tracking_id_key`.

## Table of contents
- SQL ALTER TABLE statement

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE chunk_group
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `chunk_group` table by removing a constraint.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` statement targets the `chunk_group` table.
2. The `DROP CONSTRAINT` clause is used to remove the specified constraint.
3. The constraint being removed is named `chunk_group_tracking_id_key`.

## Side Effects
- The unique constraint `chunk_group_tracking_id_key` will be removed from the `chunk_group` table.
- This may allow duplicate values in the column(s) that were previously constrained.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a comment explaining why the constraint is being removed.
- If this constraint removal is part of a larger schema change, ensure that corresponding changes are made in related tables or application code.
- After removing the constraint, it may be beneficial to review any indexes on the affected column(s) to ensure optimal query performance.
