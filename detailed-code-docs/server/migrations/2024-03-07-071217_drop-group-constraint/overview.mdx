## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for dropping a unique constraint on the `tracking_id` column in the `chunk_group` table. 

## What does it do?
The directory contains two SQL scripts:
- `up.sql`: This script removes the unique constraint called `chunk_group_tracking_id_key` from the `tracking_id` column of the `chunk_group` table. This allows for duplicate values in the `tracking_id` column.
- `down.sql`: This script reverts the changes made by `up.sql`. It adds the unique constraint `chunk_group_tracking_id_key` back to the `tracking_id` column, ensuring that all values in this column are unique.

These scripts are typically used in database migration frameworks to manage changes to the database schema in a controlled manner.
