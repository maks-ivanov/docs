## High-level description
This SQL migration script adds a new column `oc_file_path` to the `card_metadata` table. The column is designed to store file path information related to optical character recognition (OCR) for card metadata.

## Table of contents
- ALTER TABLE statement
- New column addition

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE card_metadata
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the existing `card_metadata` table structure by adding a new column.

#### Internal Logic
The command alters the `card_metadata` table to include an additional column for storing OCR-related file paths.

### ADD COLUMN oc_file_path TEXT NULL
#### Description
This clause specifies the new column to be added to the `card_metadata` table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| oc_file_path | TEXT | Stores the file path for OCR-related data |

#### Internal Logic
- The new column is named `oc_file_path`.
- It is defined as `TEXT` type, allowing for the storage of string data of variable length.
- The `NULL` constraint indicates that this column can contain null values, making it optional.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding an index on the `oc_file_path` column if it will be frequently used in queries.
- If the file paths have a specific format or maximum length, consider using a more specific data type or adding a CHECK constraint to ensure data integrity.
- Depending on the application's needs, you might want to add a trigger or constraint to validate or standardize the file path format when data is inserted or updated.
