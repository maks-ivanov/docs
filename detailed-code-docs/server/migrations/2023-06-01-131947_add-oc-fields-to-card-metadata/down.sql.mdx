## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `oc_file_path` column from the `card_metadata` table.

## Table of contents
- ALTER TABLE statement

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE card_metadata
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `card_metadata` table by removing a specific column.

#### Internal Logic
1. Identifies the `card_metadata` table
2. Uses the DROP COLUMN clause to remove the `oc_file_path` column

## Side Effects
- Permanently removes the `oc_file_path` column and all its data from the `card_metadata` table
- May affect any queries or application logic that previously relied on the `oc_file_path` column

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| PostgreSQL | This SQL syntax is compatible with PostgreSQL databases |

## Error Handling
This script does not include explicit error handling. If the column doesn't exist, the database will likely raise an error.

## Future Improvements
- Add error handling to check if the column exists before attempting to drop it
- Consider adding a transaction to ensure atomicity of the operation
- If data preservation is important, consider adding a step to backup the column data before dropping it
