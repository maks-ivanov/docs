## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding and removing the `oc_file_path` column in the `card_metadata` table. These scripts are likely designed for a relational database system like PostgreSQL.

## What does it do?
The `up.sql` script adds a new column named `oc_file_path` to the `card_metadata` table. This column is intended to store file paths related to optical character recognition (OCR) performed on card metadata. The `down.sql` script reverts this change by removing the `oc_file_path` column from the `card_metadata` table. 

These scripts are typically used in version control systems to manage database schema changes over time. Developers can apply or revert these changes as needed during development or deployment.
