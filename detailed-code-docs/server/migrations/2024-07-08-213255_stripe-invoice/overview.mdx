## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration files for managing the `stripe_invoices` table in the database. The `up.sql` file defines the table structure and creates it, while the `down.sql` file handles its removal.

## What does it do?
The files in this directory manage the lifecycle of the `stripe_invoices` table in the database. When applied, the `up.sql` script creates the table and defines its columns, including a link to the `organizations` table. This table stores information about Stripe invoices issued to organizations. The `down.sql` script reverses this process by deleting the `stripe_invoices` table.

## Key Files
- **up.sql:** This file contains the SQL code to create the `stripe_invoices` table. It defines the table structure, columns, data types, and constraints. The script ensures that each invoice is associated with an organization and includes fields for tracking invoice details and status.
- **down.sql:** This file is responsible for undoing the changes made by `up.sql`. It contains a single SQL command to drop the `stripe_invoices` table. This action is irreversible and will delete all existing invoice data.
