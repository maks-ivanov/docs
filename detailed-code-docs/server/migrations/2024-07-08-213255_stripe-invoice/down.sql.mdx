## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to undo the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` file. It drops the `stripe_invoices` table from the database.

## Table of contents
- DROP TABLE statement

## Symbols

### DROP TABLE stripe_invoices
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `stripe_invoices` table from the database schema.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
The `DROP TABLE` statement is used to completely remove the `stripe_invoices` table and all its associated data from the database.

## Side Effects
- Permanent deletion of the `stripe_invoices` table and all its contents
- Potential impact on any database objects (views, stored procedures, etc.) that depend on this table

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a check for table existence before dropping (e.g., `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS stripe_invoices;`) to prevent errors if the table doesn't exist
- If there are foreign key constraints referencing this table, consider adding `CASCADE` option to automatically remove dependent objects
