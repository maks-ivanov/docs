## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It adds a boolean column named `is_public` to the `card_collection` table with a default value of `true`.

## Table of contents
- ALTER TABLE statement
- ADD COLUMN statement

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE card_collection
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `card_collection` table.

### ADD COLUMN is_public
#### Description
This clause adds a new column named `is_public` to the `card_collection` table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| is_public | boolean | Indicates whether the card collection is public or not |

#### Internal Logic
- The column is defined as `NOT NULL`, meaning it must always have a value.
- The `DEFAULT true` clause sets the default value of this column to `true` for any existing or new rows where a value is not explicitly specified.

## Dependencies
This script relies on the existence of the `card_collection` table in the database schema.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a comment to explain the purpose of the `is_public` column for better documentation.
- If there are any indexes or constraints related to this column, they should be recreated in this migration as well.
