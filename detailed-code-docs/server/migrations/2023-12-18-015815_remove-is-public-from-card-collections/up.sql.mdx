### ALTER TABLE statement
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `card_collection` table by removing the `is_public` column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the existing `card_collection` table.
2. The `DROP COLUMN` clause is used to remove the `is_public` column from the table.

## Side Effects
- The `is_public` column and all its data will be permanently removed from the `card_collection` table.
- Any queries, views, or application code that previously relied on the `is_public` column will need to be updated to reflect this change.

## Future Improvements
- Ensure that any application logic that previously used the `is_public` column is updated to handle the absence of this field.
- Consider adding a comment explaining the reason for removing this column, which could be helpful for future maintenance.
- If there's a need to maintain information about the public/private status of card collections, consider implementing this functionality through a different mechanism, such as a separate permissions table or a different column with more granular access control options.
