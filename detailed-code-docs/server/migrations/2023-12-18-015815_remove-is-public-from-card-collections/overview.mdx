## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for the `card_collection` table. The scripts specifically address the removal and restoration of the `is_public` column, which determines the visibility of a card collection.

## What does it do?
The directory houses two SQL scripts that act as a reciprocal pair for database migration:

1. **`up.sql`**: This script removes the `is_public` column from the `card_collection` table. This implies a functional change where the system no longer distinguishes between public and private card collections.

2. **`down.sql`**: This script reverts the changes made by `up.sql`. It adds the `is_public` column back to the `card_collection` table, setting a default value of `true` for existing and new collections. This ensures backward compatibility if the decision to remove the public/private distinction is reversed.
