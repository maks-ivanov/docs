## High-level description
This SQL migration script removes the `stripe_customers` table from the database if it exists. It's a simple, single-operation migration that cleans up potentially outdated or unnecessary data structures related to Stripe customer information.

## Table of contents
- DROP TABLE statement

## Symbols

### DROP TABLE IF EXISTS stripe_customers
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `stripe_customers` table from the database schema if it exists. If the table doesn't exist, the operation completes without raising an error.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a standalone SQL command that doesn't take any inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This command doesn't return any data. It either successfully drops the table or does nothing if the table doesn't exist.

#### Side Effects
- If the `stripe_customers` table exists, it will be permanently removed from the database, along with all its data and associated indexes or constraints.
- If the table doesn't exist, there will be no changes to the database structure.

## Performance Considerations
This operation is typically fast, especially if the table is small. However, for large tables, it might take some time and could potentially lock the database briefly, depending on the database management system being used.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a comment explaining why the table is being dropped, which could be helpful for future maintenance.
- If there are any foreign key constraints referencing this table, they should be dropped first to ensure a clean removal.
- After dropping the table, it might be beneficial to run VACUUM (for PostgreSQL) or similar optimization commands for other database systems to reclaim storage and update statistics.
