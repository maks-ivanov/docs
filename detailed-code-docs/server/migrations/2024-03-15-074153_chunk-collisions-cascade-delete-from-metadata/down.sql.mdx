title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL script is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It modifies the foreign key constraints of the `chunk_collisions` table, reverting them to their previous state and renaming them.

## Table of contents
- Drop and recreate foreign key constraint for `chunk_id`
- Drop and recreate foreign key constraint for `collision_qdrant_id`

## Symbols

### SQL Commands

#### Description
The script consists of four main SQL commands that alter the `chunk_collisions` table:

1. Drop the foreign key constraint `chunk_collisions_card_id_fkey`
2. Add a new foreign key constraint `card_collisions_card_id_fkey`
3. Drop the foreign key constraint `chunk_collisions_collision_qdrant_id_fkey`
4. Add a new foreign key constraint `card_collisions_collision_qdrant_id_fkey`

#### Internal Logic
1. The script first removes the existing foreign key constraints that were likely added in the `up.sql` file.
2. It then adds new foreign key constraints with different names, presumably reverting to the previous state of the table.
3. The new constraints reference the `chunk_metadata` table, suggesting a relationship between `chunk_collisions` and `chunk_metadata`.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the structure of the `chunk_collisions` table
- Changes the referential integrity constraints of the database

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| chunk_collisions table | The table being modified |
| chunk_metadata table | Referenced by the new foreign key constraints |

## Error Handling
This script does not include explicit error handling. If any of the commands fail, the database system will likely roll back the transaction.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding error handling or validation checks to ensure the operations complete successfully.
- If the `up.sql` file introduces any new columns or data modifications, this `down.sql` script should address those changes as well.
- Ensure that the constraint names (`card_collisions_card_id_fkey` and `card_collisions_collision_qdrant_id_fkey`) are consistent with the overall naming convention of the database schema.
