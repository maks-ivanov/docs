## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `referral_tokens` column from the `invitations` table in the database.

## Table of contents
- SQL statement to alter the `invitations` table

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE invitations
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the `invitations` table by removing the `referral_tokens` column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the existing `invitations` table.
2. The `DROP COLUMN` clause is used to remove the `referral_tokens` column from the table.

## Side Effects
- The `referral_tokens` column and all its data will be permanently removed from the `invitations` table.
- Any queries or application code that relied on the `referral_tokens` column will no longer function correctly after this migration is applied.

## Future Improvements
- Ensure that all application code and queries are updated to remove references to the `referral_tokens` column before applying this migration.
- Consider adding a backup mechanism to preserve the data in the `referral_tokens` column before dropping it, if the information might be needed in the future.
