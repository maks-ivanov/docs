## High-level description
This directory contains database migration scripts for adding and removing a `referral_tokens` column to the `invitations` table. The `up.sql` script adds the column, while the `down.sql` script reverts this change.

## What does it do?
These SQL scripts manage changes to the database structure. The `up.sql` script modifies the `invitations` table to include a new column for storing referral tokens. The `down.sql` script undoes this change by removing the `referral_tokens` column. This allows for version control and rollback of database schema modifications.
