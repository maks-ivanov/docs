## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding a new 'name' column to the 'stripe_plans' table in the database. The migration is split into two files: an 'up' script to apply the change and a 'down' script to revert it.

## What does it do?
These migration scripts modify the structure of the 'stripe_plans' table in the database. The 'up' script adds a new column called 'name' to store additional information about each stripe plan. The 'down' script provides a way to remove this column if needed, reverting the database to its previous state.

When applied, the 'up' migration will add a 'name' column to the 'stripe_plans' table. This column is defined as a non-nullable TEXT field with a default empty string value. This means that every stripe plan in the database will now have a 'name' associated with it, even if it's just an empty string by default.

If for any reason this change needs to be undone, the 'down' migration can be run to remove the 'name' column from the 'stripe_plans' table, effectively erasing this piece of information from all stripe plans in the database.

## Key Files

1. `up.sql`
   - This file contains the SQL command to add the 'name' column to the 'stripe_plans' table.
   - The command used is:
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE stripe_plans ADD COLUMN name TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT ''
     ```
   - This ensures that the new column is added as a non-nullable TEXT field with a default empty string value.

2. `down.sql`
   - This file contains the SQL command to remove the 'name' column from the 'stripe_plans' table.
   - The command used is:
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE stripe_plans DROP COLUMN name;
     ```
   - This command will completely remove the 'name' column and all its data from the table.

## Configuration
These migration scripts do not require any additional configuration. They are designed to be run as part of a database migration process, typically managed by an ORM or migration tool.

## Side Effects and Considerations
- When the 'up' migration is applied, all existing rows in the 'stripe_plans' table will have the new 'name' column populated with an empty string due to the default value.
- Any application code or queries that interact with the 'stripe_plans' table will need to be updated to handle the new 'name' column after the 'up' migration is applied.
- Running the 'down' migration will permanently remove the 'name' column and all its data. This action is irreversible unless you have a backup of the data.
- It's important to ensure that all parts of the application that interact with the 'stripe_plans' table are updated to reflect the addition or removal of the 'name' column, depending on which migration is applied.

## Future Improvements
1. Data population: After applying the 'up' migration, consider updating existing rows with meaningful names instead of leaving them as empty strings.
2. Indexing: Evaluate if an index should be created on the 'name' column for performance optimization, especially if it will be frequently used in queries.
3. Backup mechanism: Implement a backup process before running these migrations, especially the 'down' migration, to allow for data recovery if needed.
4. Validation: Add checks or constraints to ensure the 'name' column contains valid and meaningful data when it's being populated.

By implementing these migrations, the database schema becomes more flexible, allowing for the storage of additional information (names) for stripe plans. This can enhance the functionality and user experience of the application that uses this database.
