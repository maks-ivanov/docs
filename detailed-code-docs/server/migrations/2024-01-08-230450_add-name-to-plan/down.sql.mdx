## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `name` column from the `stripe_plans` table in the database.

## Table of contents
- SQL statement to drop the `name` column

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE stripe_plans DROP COLUMN name;
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `name` column from the `stripe_plans` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of an existing table.
2. `stripe_plans` is the target table being altered.
3. `DROP COLUMN` is the specific alteration being made, which removes a column from the table.
4. `name` is the name of the column being removed.

## Side Effects
- This migration will permanently remove the `name` column and all its data from the `stripe_plans` table.
- Any queries or application code that previously relied on the `name` column in the `stripe_plans` table will no longer function correctly after this migration is applied.

## Future Improvements
- Ensure that all parts of the application that interact with the `stripe_plans` table are updated to reflect the removal of the `name` column.
- Consider adding a backup mechanism before running destructive migrations like this one to allow for data recovery if needed.
