## High-level description
This SQL migration script adds a new column named 'name' to the 'stripe_plans' table. The column is defined as a non-nullable TEXT field with a default empty string value.

## Table of contents
- ALTER TABLE statement

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE stripe_plans ADD COLUMN name TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT ''
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the existing 'stripe_plans' table by adding a new column called 'name'.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of an existing table.
2. `stripe_plans` is the name of the table being altered.
3. `ADD COLUMN` specifies that a new column is being added to the table.
4. `name` is the name of the new column being added.
5. `TEXT` defines the data type of the new column, allowing it to store string data of variable length.
6. `NOT NULL` constraint ensures that this column cannot contain NULL values.
7. `DEFAULT ''` sets the default value for this column to an empty string when no value is explicitly provided during insertion.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the structure of the 'stripe_plans' table in the database.
- Existing rows in the table will have the new 'name' column populated with an empty string due to the default value.
- Any code or queries that interact with the 'stripe_plans' table will now have access to this new 'name' column.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a corresponding down migration to reverse this change if needed.
- If the 'name' column is intended to store meaningful data, consider updating existing rows with appropriate values after the migration.
- Evaluate if any indexes should be created on the 'name' column for performance optimization, especially if it will be frequently used in queries.
