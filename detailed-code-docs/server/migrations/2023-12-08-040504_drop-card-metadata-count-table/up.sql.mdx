## High-level description
This SQL migration script removes the `card_metadata_count` table, its associated trigger, and the function used to update the count. It's designed to clean up database objects related to card metadata counting.

## Table of contents
- Drop `card_metadata_count` table
- Drop `card_metadata_count_trigger` trigger
- Drop `update_card_metadata_count()` function

## Symbols

### DROP TABLE card_metadata_count
#### Description
This command removes the `card_metadata_count` table from the database schema.

#### Side Effects
- Permanently deletes the `card_metadata_count` table and all its data
- Removes any dependencies on this table (e.g., views, foreign keys)

### DROP TRIGGER card_metadata_count_trigger ON card_metadata
#### Description
This command removes the trigger named `card_metadata_count_trigger` that was associated with the `card_metadata` table.

#### Side Effects
- Eliminates the automatic execution of the trigger function when changes occur on the `card_metadata` table
- May affect data integrity if the trigger was responsible for maintaining consistency

### DROP FUNCTION update_card_metadata_count()
#### Description
This command removes the function `update_card_metadata_count()` from the database.

#### Side Effects
- Deletes the function definition from the database
- Any other objects (e.g., triggers, stored procedures) that depend on this function may become invalid

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding comments to explain why these objects are being removed
- If this is part of a larger refactoring, ensure that any application code relying on the removed objects is updated accordingly
- Implement a corresponding "down" migration to recreate these objects if needed for rollback purposes
