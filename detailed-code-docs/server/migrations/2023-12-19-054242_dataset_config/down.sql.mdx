title: "down.sql"

The provided file `down.sql` is currently empty, containing only a comment. This file is typically used in database migrations to undo the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` file. To properly complete this file, we need to know what changes were made in the `up.sql` file.

Without knowing the specific changes made in the `up.sql` file, it's impossible to provide an accurate `down.sql` script. However, I can give you a general idea of what you might include in a `down.sql` file:

1. If tables were created in `up.sql`, you would typically drop those tables in `down.sql`.
2. If columns were added to existing tables, you would remove those columns.
3. If data was inserted, you might delete that data.
4. If indexes or constraints were added, you would remove them.

For example, if the `up.sql` file created a new table called `dataset_config`, the `down.sql` file might look like this:

```sql
-- This file should undo anything in `up.sql`
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS dataset_config;
```

Remember, the exact content of the `down.sql` file should mirror the opposite actions of what was done in the `up.sql` file. If you can provide the contents of the `up.sql` file, I can help you create a more accurate `down.sql` file.
