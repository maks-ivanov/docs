## High-level description
This directory contains database migration scripts for managing changes related to dataset configuration in the application. The scripts use SQL language and are designed for a PostgreSQL database.

## What does it do?
The `up.sql` script modifies the existing `datasets` table in the database to include a new column named `configuration`. This column stores a JSON object containing configuration data for each dataset. The `down.sql` script is intended to reverse these changes but is currently empty and needs to be populated with the appropriate commands.

## Key Files
### up.sql
This file contains the SQL commands to apply the migration. It adds a new column called `configuration` to the `datasets` table. This column is of type JSONB, defaults to an empty JSON object (`{}`), and cannot be NULL.

### down.sql
This file is intended to revert the changes made by `up.sql`. Currently, it's empty and needs to be populated with the command to drop the `configuration` column from the `datasets` table.

## Dependencies
- **PostgreSQL:** The migration scripts utilize the JSONB data type, which is specific to PostgreSQL.

## Configuration
This migration itself doesn't introduce any configuration files or environment variables. However, it modifies the database schema to support storing configuration data within the `datasets` table using the JSON format.
