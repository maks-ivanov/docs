## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for managing the `cut_cards` table in the database. The `up.sql` script creates the table and its associated columns, constraints, and indexes, while the `down.sql` script reverts these changes by dropping the table.

## What does it do?
The scripts in this directory are used to manage the lifecycle of the `cut_cards` table in the database. When applied, the `up.sql` script creates the table with the specified columns and constraints, enabling the application to store information about cut cards. Conversely, the `down.sql` script drops the table, removing it and its data from the database. These scripts are typically used in conjunction with a database migration tool to manage schema changes over time.

## Key Files
### up.sql
This script creates the `cut_cards` table with the following columns:

- `id`: A UUID serving as the primary key for uniquely identifying each cut card.
- `user_id`: A UUID referencing the `users` table, indicating the user who created the cut card.
- `cut_card_content`: A TEXT field storing the actual content of the cut card.
- `created_at`: A TIMESTAMP recording the creation time of the cut card.
- `updated_at`: A TIMESTAMP tracking the last update time of the cut card.

The script also establishes a foreign key constraint on the `user_id` column, linking it to the `users` table to ensure data integrity.

### down.sql
This script simply drops the `cut_cards` table from the database. It's important to note that this action is irreversible and will result in data loss.
