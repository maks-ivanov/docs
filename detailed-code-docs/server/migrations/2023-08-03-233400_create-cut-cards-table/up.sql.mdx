### `cut_cards` Table
#### Description
The `cut_cards` table is created to store information about cut cards. Each record in this table represents a single cut card with its associated data.

#### Columns
| Name | Type | Constraints | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|:------------|
| id | UUID | PRIMARY KEY | Unique identifier for each cut card |
| user_id | UUID | NOT NULL, REFERENCES users (id) | Foreign key linking to the users table |
| cut_card_content | TEXT | NOT NULL | The content of the cut card |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | NOT NULL, DEFAULT NOW() | Timestamp of when the cut card was created |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMP | NOT NULL, DEFAULT NOW() | Timestamp of when the cut card was last updated |

#### Internal Logic
- The table uses UUIDs for the primary key and foreign key, ensuring unique identification across distributed systems.
- A foreign key constraint is applied to `user_id`, referencing the `id` column in the `users` table, maintaining referential integrity.
- Both `created_at` and `updated_at` columns are automatically set to the current timestamp when a record is inserted, using the `NOW()` function as the default value.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| users table | The `cut_cards` table references the `users` table for the `user_id` foreign key |

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding an index on the `user_id` column to improve query performance when searching for cut cards by user.
- If versioning of cut cards is required, consider adding a version number column.
- Depending on the application's needs, you might want to add additional columns such as `title`, `tags`, or `category` to enhance organization and searchability of cut cards.
