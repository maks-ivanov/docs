## High-level description
This SQL script is designed to undo the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` migration. It drops the `cut_cards` table from the database.

## Table of contents
- Drop table statement

## Symbols

### DROP TABLE cut_cards
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `cut_cards` table from the database schema.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
The `DROP TABLE` statement is used to completely remove the `cut_cards` table and all its associated data from the database.

## Side Effects
- Permanently deletes the `cut_cards` table and all its contents from the database.
- Removes any associated indexes, constraints, or triggers tied to the `cut_cards` table.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a check for table existence before dropping (e.g., `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS cut_cards;`) to prevent errors if the table doesn't exist.
- If there are any foreign key constraints referencing this table, consider adding `CASCADE` option to automatically remove dependent objects.
