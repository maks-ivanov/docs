## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for managing the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table in the database. The scripts handle both the creation and deletion of the table and its associated columns and constraints.

## What does it do?
The files in this directory are responsible for updating the database schema to include a table for storing notifications about completed file uploads. This table allows the application to inform users when a file upload related to a specific collection is finished. The `up.sql` script creates the table and its columns, while the `down.sql` script reverses these changes by deleting the table.

## Key Files
- **up.sql:** This script creates the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table. The table includes columns for tracking the user, the associated collection, whether the user has read the notification, and timestamps for creation and updates.
- **down.sql:** This script drops the `file_upload_completed_notifications` table. It's used to roll back the changes introduced by the `up.sql` script.
