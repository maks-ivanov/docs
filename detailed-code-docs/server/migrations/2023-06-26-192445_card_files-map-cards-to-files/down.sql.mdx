## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to undo the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` file. It drops the `card_files` table if it exists in the database.

## Table of contents
- DROP TABLE statement

## Symbols

### DROP TABLE IF EXISTS card_files
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `card_files` table from the database if it exists. It's a safe operation that won't throw an error if the table doesn't exist.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the command will not throw an error if the table doesn't exist in the database. This makes the migration script more robust and idempotent.

## Side Effects
- Permanently removes the `card_files` table and all its data from the database if the table exists.
- If the table doesn't exist, the command has no effect on the database.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a backup mechanism before dropping the table to prevent accidental data loss.
- If there are any foreign key constraints referencing this table, they should be dropped first to ensure a clean removal.
