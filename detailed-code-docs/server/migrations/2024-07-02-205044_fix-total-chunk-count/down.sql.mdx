## High-level description
This SQL script is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` migration. It primarily focuses on removing the `NOT NULL` constraint from the `chunk_count` column in the `organization_usage_counts` table and dropping a trigger function.

## Table of contents
- Alter `organization_usage_counts` table
- Drop trigger function

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE organization_usage_counts
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `NOT NULL` constraint from the `chunk_count` column in the `organization_usage_counts` table.

#### Internal Logic
The command uses the `ALTER COLUMN` clause to modify the `chunk_count` column, specifically using `DROP NOT NULL` to remove the not-null constraint.

### DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS update_organization_chunk_count
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `update_organization_chunk_count` function if it exists in the database.

#### Internal Logic
The `DROP FUNCTION` statement is used with the `IF EXISTS` clause to ensure that the function is dropped only if it exists, preventing potential errors if the function is not present.

## Side Effects
- The `chunk_count` column in the `organization_usage_counts` table will allow NULL values after this migration is applied.
- The `update_organization_chunk_count` function will be removed from the database.

## Future Improvements
- The commented-out sections suggest that there might be additional data updates or reversals that could be implemented if needed in the future. These sections could be uncommented and adjusted if a more comprehensive rollback is required.
- Consider adding error handling or logging to track the success of the migration, especially for critical operations like dropping functions or altering table structures.
