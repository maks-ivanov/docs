## High-level description
The `server/migrations/2023-12-23-032731_rename_card_to_chunk` directory contains SQL migration scripts for renaming database entities from "card" to "chunk". This change likely reflects a conceptual shift in the application's data model.

## What does it do?
This directory houses two SQL scripts:

- `up.sql`: Renames database tables and columns from "card" to "chunk". This script is executed to apply the migration.
- `down.sql`: Reverts the changes made by `up.sql`, renaming entities back to "card". This script is used to rollback the migration if needed.

These scripts work in tandem to ensure a controlled and reversible change to the database schema, reflecting the application's evolution from using "cards" to "chunks" as a core data unit.
