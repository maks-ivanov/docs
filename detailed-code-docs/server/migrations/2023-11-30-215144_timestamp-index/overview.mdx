## High-level description
This directory contains database migration scripts related to creating and removing timestamp indexes on the `card_metadata` and `files` tables. The purpose is to improve query performance for time-based operations.

## What does it do?
The `up.sql` script creates indexes on the `time_stamp` columns of the `card_metadata` and `files` tables. These indexes speed up queries that filter, sort, or join data based on timestamps. 

Conversely, the `down.sql` script reverts these changes by removing the created indexes. This action is usually performed during a database rollback or when the indexes are no longer needed.
