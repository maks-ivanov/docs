## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes two timestamp indexes that were previously created for the `card` and `file` tables.

## Table of contents
- DROP INDEX statements for card_time_stamp_index
- DROP INDEX statements for file_time_stamp_index

## Symbols

### `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS card_time_stamp_index`
#### Description
This SQL command removes the index named `card_time_stamp_index` if it exists in the database.

#### Side Effects
- Removes the `card_time_stamp_index` from the database schema
- May affect query performance for operations that previously utilized this index

### `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS file_time_stamp_index`
#### Description
This SQL command removes the index named `file_time_stamp_index` if it exists in the database.

#### Side Effects
- Removes the `file_time_stamp_index` from the database schema
- May affect query performance for operations that previously utilized this index

## Error Handling
The script uses `IF EXISTS` clauses in the DROP INDEX statements to prevent errors if the indexes do not exist. This ensures the script can be run multiple times without causing errors.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding comments to explain why these indexes are being removed
- If these indexes are critical for performance, consider adding a warning or documentation about potential performance impacts of removing them
