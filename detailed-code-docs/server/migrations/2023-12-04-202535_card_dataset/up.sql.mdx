## High-level description
This SQL script creates a new table named `datasets` in the database. The table is designed to store information about datasets, including a unique identifier, name, and timestamps for creation and last update.

## Table of contents

### `datasets` table
#### Description
The `datasets` table is created to store information about datasets. It includes columns for a unique identifier, name, and timestamps for creation and last update.

#### Columns
| Name | Type | Constraints | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|:------------|
| id | UUID | NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY, DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() | Unique identifier for each dataset |
| name | TEXT | NOT NULL | Name of the dataset |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | NOT NULL, DEFAULT NOW() | Timestamp of when the dataset was created |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMP | NOT NULL, DEFAULT NOW() | Timestamp of when the dataset was last updated |

#### Internal Logic
- The `id` column uses the `gen_random_uuid()` function to automatically generate a unique UUID for each new dataset entry.
- Both `created_at` and `updated_at` columns use the `NOW()` function to automatically set the current timestamp when a new record is inserted.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| gen_random_uuid() | PostgreSQL function to generate random UUIDs |
| NOW() | PostgreSQL function to get the current timestamp |

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding indexes on frequently queried columns, such as `name` or `created_at`, to improve query performance if the table is expected to grow large.
- If versioning of datasets is required, consider adding a `version` column or implementing a separate versioning table.
- Depending on the application's needs, additional columns like `description`, `owner`, or `status` could be added to provide more context about each dataset.
