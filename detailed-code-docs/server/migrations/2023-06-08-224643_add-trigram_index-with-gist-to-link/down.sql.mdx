## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to undo the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes a GIN index named `idx_link_gin` from a database table.

## Table of contents
- DROP INDEX statement

## Symbols

### DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_link_gin
#### Description
This SQL command removes the GIN index named `idx_link_gin` if it exists in the database.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
The `DROP INDEX` statement is used to remove an index from the database. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the command doesn't throw an error if the index doesn't exist. This is a safe way to ensure idempotency of the migration.

## Side Effects
- Removes the `idx_link_gin` index from the database if it exists.
- May affect query performance for operations that previously used this index.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a comment explaining which table this index was associated with, for better context.
- If there are any dependencies on this index, consider addressing them in this migration file.
