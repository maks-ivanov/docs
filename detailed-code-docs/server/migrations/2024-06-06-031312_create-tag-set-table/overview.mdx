## High-level description
The `/server/migrations/2024-06-06-031312_create-tag-set-table` directory contains SQL migration scripts for managing database tables related to a tagging system. The scripts handle the creation and deletion of tables designed to associate tags with datasets and chunk metadata.

## What does it do?
This directory contains two SQL scripts that manage database tables for a tagging system. One script creates the tables, while the other removes them. This system allows datasets and individual pieces of data within those datasets to be tagged with descriptive labels. This makes it easier to search for and organize data within the application.

## Key Files
- **up.sql**: This script creates two tables: `dataset_tags` and `chunk_metadata_tags`. 
    - `dataset_tags` links datasets to specific tags. For example, a dataset containing images of cats could be tagged with "cats", "pets", and "animals".
    - `chunk_metadata_tags` associates tags with individual pieces of data within a dataset. For instance, a specific image within the "cats" dataset could be tagged with "kitten" or "sleeping".
- **down.sql**: This script undoes the changes made by `up.sql`. It drops both the `dataset_tags` and `chunk_metadata_tags` tables, effectively removing the tagging system from the database.
