## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to undo the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` file. It drops two tables: `chunk_metadata_tags` and `dataset_tags`.

## Table of contents
- Drop `chunk_metadata_tags` table
- Drop `dataset_tags` table

## Symbols

### DROP TABLE IF EXISTS chunk_metadata_tags
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `chunk_metadata_tags` table from the database if it exists.

#### Side Effects
- If the `chunk_metadata_tags` table exists, it will be permanently deleted from the database, along with all its data.
- If the table doesn't exist, the command will have no effect.

### DROP TABLE IF EXISTS dataset_tags
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `dataset_tags` table from the database if it exists.

#### Side Effects
- If the `dataset_tags` table exists, it will be permanently deleted from the database, along with all its data.
- If the table doesn't exist, the command will have no effect.

## Error Handling
The `IF EXISTS` clause in both DROP TABLE statements ensures that no error is raised if the tables do not exist in the database. This makes the migration script more robust and idempotent.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a transaction wrapper around the DROP TABLE statements to ensure atomicity of the operation.
- If there are any foreign key constraints or dependencies on these tables, it might be necessary to drop those constraints first before dropping the tables.
- Add comments explaining the purpose of these tables and why they are being dropped, to provide more context for future developers.
