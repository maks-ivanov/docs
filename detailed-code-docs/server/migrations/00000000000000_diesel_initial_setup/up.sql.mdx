This SQL file is part of the Diesel ORM setup for a PostgreSQL database. It creates two functions that help manage the `updated_at` column for tables in your database:

1. `diesel_manage_updated_at(_tbl regclass)`: This function creates a trigger for a given table to automatically update the `updated_at` column whenever a row is modified.

2. `diesel_set_updated_at()`: This function is used by the trigger created by `diesel_manage_updated_at`. It sets the `updated_at` column to the current timestamp when a row is updated.

These functions are typically used to automatically keep track of when records were last modified in your database tables. To use this functionality, you would:

1. Create a table with an `updated_at` column.
2. Call `SELECT diesel_manage_updated_at('your_table_name');` to set up the automatic updating for that table.

This setup allows you to easily maintain `updated_at` timestamps without having to manually set them in your application code every time you update a record.

The file is marked as safe to edit, meaning you can add additional setup or helper functions here if needed for your project. Any future changes made by Diesel will be added as new migrations, preserving your custom modifications to this file.
