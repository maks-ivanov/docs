## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for managing database schema changes related to Diesel ORM setup. It includes scripts for both upgrading and reverting the initial setup of Diesel-specific database functions.

## What does it do?
These SQL scripts are responsible for setting up and tearing down helper functions in the database that Diesel ORM uses to manage timestamps, specifically the `updated_at` column in tables. 

The `up.sql` script creates two functions:
- `diesel_manage_updated_at`: This function sets up a trigger on a given table to automatically update the `updated_at` column whenever a row in that table is modified.
- `diesel_set_updated_at`: This function is used by the trigger created by `diesel_manage_updated_at`. It sets the `updated_at` column to the current timestamp when a row is updated.

The `down.sql` script essentially reverts the changes made by `up.sql`. It drops the two functions mentioned above, removing the automatic timestamp management functionality provided by Diesel.

This approach ensures that the `updated_at` column is automatically updated whenever a row is modified, simplifying application code and ensuring data consistency.

## Key Files
- `up.sql`: Contains SQL commands to be executed when applying the migration. In this case, it creates the necessary functions for Diesel's timestamp management.
- `down.sql`: Contains SQL commands to be executed when reverting the migration. It drops the functions created by `up.sql`, effectively undoing the changes.

## Dependencies
- **Diesel ORM**: These migration scripts are specifically designed for Diesel ORM and rely on its conventions and functionality.
