## High-level description
This SQL script creates a PostgreSQL function `update_notification_count()` that manages a user's notification count. It automatically increments the count when a new notification is inserted and decrements it when a notification is deleted.

### `update_notification_count()`
#### Description
This is a PostgreSQL function that serves as a trigger function to maintain an accurate count of notifications for each user. It handles both insertion of new notifications and deletion of existing ones.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't explicitly take any inputs. As a trigger function, it implicitly works with the `NEW` and `OLD` record variables provided by the triggering event.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| RETURN | TRIGGER | Returns the `NEW` record as required by trigger functions |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function first checks the operation type (`TG_OP`).
2. For INSERT operations:
   - It attempts to insert a new record into the `user_notification_counts` table.
   - If a record for the user already exists, it updates the existing count instead.
3. For DELETE operations:
   - It updates the `user_notification_counts` table, decrementing the count for the affected user.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the `user_notification_counts` table by inserting new records or updating existing ones.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| PostgreSQL | This script uses PostgreSQL-specific syntax and features |

## Error Handling
The function doesn't implement explicit error handling. It relies on PostgreSQL's default error handling mechanisms.

## Future Improvements
1. Add error handling for cases where the notification count might become negative.
2. Consider adding a check to ensure the user exists before updating their notification count.
3. Implement logging for debugging purposes, especially for tracking unexpected behavior.
4. Add handling for UPDATE operations if notifications can be modified.
5. Consider adding a maximum cap on the notification count to prevent potential integer overflow issues.
