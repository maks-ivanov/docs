## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration files for managing changes related to user notification counts in a PostgreSQL database. It includes an `up.sql` file for applying the migration and a `down.sql` file for reverting it. 

## What does it do?
The `up.sql` file introduces a new PostgreSQL function called `update_notification_count()`. This function is designed to be used as a trigger on the notifications table. Whenever a new notification is added for a user, this function automatically increases their notification count. Conversely, when a notification is deleted, the function decreases the count. This ensures that the notification count for each user remains accurate.

The `down.sql` file is intended for rolling back the changes made by `up.sql`. However, it's currently empty, indicating that the changes introduced by this migration are not meant to be reverted.
