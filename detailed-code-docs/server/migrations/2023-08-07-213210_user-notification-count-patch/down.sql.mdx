### Comment
#### Description
The file contains two comments that explain its purpose and the lack of reversion actions.

1. `-- This file should undo anything in `up.sql``
   This comment indicates that the file's purpose is to undo changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file.

2. `-- Nothing to revert here`
   This comment explicitly states that there are no actions to revert from the associated `up.sql` migration.

## Future Improvements
- If the corresponding `up.sql` file is modified in the future to include reversible changes, this `down.sql` file should be updated accordingly to include the necessary SQL commands for reverting those changes.
- Consider adding a comment explaining why there's nothing to revert, if applicable, to provide more context for future developers.
