## High-level description
This directory contains database migration files related to the `cut_chunks` table. It includes an "up" migration to drop the table and a "down" migration to recreate it.

## What does it do?
The files in this directory manage changes to the database structure related to the `cut_chunks` table. The `up.sql` file drops the table entirely, removing it from the database. The `down.sql` file reverts this change by recreating the `cut_chunks` table with its original columns and constraints. This table likely stored information about "cut chunks" associated with users, potentially representing segments of content. 

The `down.sql` file defines the table with columns for:

- `id`: A unique identifier for each cut chunk.
- `user_id`: A foreign key linking the cut chunk to a specific user.
- `cut_card_content`: The actual content of the cut chunk.
- `created_at`: A timestamp indicating when the record was created.
- `updated_at`: A timestamp indicating when the record was last updated.

The `down.sql` migration ensures data integrity by enforcing `NOT NULL` constraints on relevant columns and establishes relationships with other tables through foreign keys.
