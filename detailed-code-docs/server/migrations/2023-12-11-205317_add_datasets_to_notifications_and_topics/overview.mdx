## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding and removing a `dataset_id` column and associated foreign key constraints to and from the `file_upload_completed_notifications`, `topics`, and `messages` tables. These migrations are designed to work with a relational database system.

## What does it do?
The `up.sql` script modifies the database schema to associate notifications, topics, and messages with specific datasets. It adds a `dataset_id` column to each of these tables and creates foreign key constraints to ensure referential integrity with the `datasets` table.

The `down.sql` script reverts these changes by removing the `dataset_id` column and its associated foreign key constraints from the affected tables. This effectively removes the ability to link these entities to datasets at the database level.

These scripts are typically used in conjunction with a database migration tool to manage schema changes in a controlled and versioned manner.
