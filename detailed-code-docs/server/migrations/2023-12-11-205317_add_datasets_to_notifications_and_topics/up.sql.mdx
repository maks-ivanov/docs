## High-level description
This SQL migration script adds a `dataset_id` column to the `file_upload_completed_notifications`, `topics`, and `messages` tables, and establishes foreign key relationships between these tables and the `datasets` table.

## Table of contents
- Add `dataset_id` column to tables
- Add foreign key constraints

## Code Structure
The script consists of two main parts: adding the `dataset_id` column to three tables and then creating foreign key constraints for these new columns.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE statements (Adding columns)
#### Description
These statements add a new column `dataset_id` of type UUID to the `file_upload_completed_notifications`, `topics`, and `messages` tables.

#### Internal Logic
For each table:
1. Adds a new column named `dataset_id`
2. Sets the column type to UUID
3. Makes the column NOT NULL

### ALTER TABLE statements (Adding constraints)
#### Description
These statements create foreign key constraints for the newly added `dataset_id` columns, linking them to the `datasets` table.

#### Internal Logic
For each table:
1. Adds a new constraint with a unique name
2. Sets the `dataset_id` column as a foreign key
3. References the `id` column in the `datasets` table

## Side Effects
- Modifies the structure of the `file_upload_completed_notifications`, `topics`, and `messages` tables
- Establishes referential integrity between these tables and the `datasets` table

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding indexes on the `dataset_id` columns to improve query performance, especially if these columns will be frequently used in JOIN operations or WHERE clauses
- If the tables already contain data, a data migration strategy might be needed to populate the new `dataset_id` columns with valid values
