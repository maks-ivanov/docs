## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding and removing a unique constraint on the `name` column of the `organizations` table. 

## What does it do?
The `up.sql` script ensures that each organization in the database has a unique name. This prevents duplicate organization names from being stored. The `down.sql` script reverts this change, allowing for duplicate organization names. 

## Key Files
- **up.sql**: Adds a unique constraint to the `name` column of the `organizations` table. This ensures that all organization names in the database are unique.
- **down.sql**: Removes the unique constraint added by `up.sql`, allowing for duplicate organization names in the `organizations` table.
