## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for renaming the `tag_set_array` column to `tag_set` in the database schema. Two files, `up.sql` and `down.sql`, manage the forward and reverse migrations, respectively.

## What does it do?
The `up.sql` script renames the `tag_set_array` column to `tag_set` and drops the original `tag_set` column in three tables: `chunk_metadata`, `files`, and `chunk_group`. This suggests a schema change where the intended way to store tag sets is being updated.

The `down.sql` script reverts these changes by renaming `tag_set` back to `tag_set_array` and adding a new `tag_set` column. This ensures that the database schema can be rolled back to its previous state if needed.

These scripts are likely used as part of a database migration framework, which handles executing them in the correct order during database upgrades and rollbacks.
