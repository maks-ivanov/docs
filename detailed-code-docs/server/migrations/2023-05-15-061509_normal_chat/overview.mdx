## High-level description
This directory contains database migration files for adding and removing the `normal_chat` column from the `topics` table. The `up.sql` file describes the forward migration, while the `down.sql` file describes how to revert the changes.

## What does it do?
The migration files in this directory manage changes to the database structure related to a "normal chat" feature. The `up.sql` file adds a new boolean column called `normal_chat` to the `topics` table. This column indicates whether a topic is considered a "normal chat" or not. The `down.sql` file reverses this change by removing the `normal_chat` column from the `topics` table.
