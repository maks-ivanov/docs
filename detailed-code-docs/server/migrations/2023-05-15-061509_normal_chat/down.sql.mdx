## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `normal_chat` column from the `topics` table in the database.

## Table of contents
- ALTER TABLE statement

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE statement
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the `topics` table by removing the `normal_chat` column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the existing `topics` table.
2. The `DROP COLUMN` clause is used to remove the `normal_chat` column from the table.

## Side Effects
- Removing the `normal_chat` column will result in the loss of any data stored in that column.
- Any queries or application code that relied on the `normal_chat` column will need to be updated to avoid errors.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a backup mechanism before running this migration to preserve the data in the `normal_chat` column if it might be needed later.
- If the `normal_chat` column is referenced in any views, indexes, or constraints, those would need to be dropped before this migration and recreated after, if still relevant.
