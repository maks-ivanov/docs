## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for managing the `users` table in the database. The scripts define the table structure, constraints, and data types for storing user information.

## What does it do?
The `up.sql` script creates the `users` table and defines its columns, including user ID, email, password hash, and timestamps. This table is essential for storing and managing user accounts. The `down.sql` script handles the reverse operation, dropping the `users` table when rolling back the migration.

## Key Files
- **up.sql:** This script is responsible for creating the `users` table and defining its schema. It sets up columns for storing user ID, email, password hash, creation timestamp, and update timestamp.
- **down.sql:** This script handles the rollback operation by dropping the `users` table. It ensures that the database schema returns to its previous state before the `users` table was added.
