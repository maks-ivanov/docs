## High-level description
This SQL script is designed to undo the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` migration. It drops the `users` table if it exists in the database.

## Table of contents
- Drop users table

## Symbols

### `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users;`
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `users` table from the database if it exists.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the command will not throw an error if the `users` table does not exist in the database. This makes the migration script idempotent, allowing it to be run multiple times without causing errors.

## Side Effects
- Permanently removes the `users` table and all its data from the database if the table exists.
- If the table doesn't exist, the command will have no effect on the database.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a backup mechanism before dropping the table to prevent accidental data loss.
- If there are any foreign key constraints referencing the `users` table, those should be dropped first to ensure a clean removal of the table.
