## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for updating the `events` table. The scripts specifically target the `event_type` column, replacing the prefix 'card_' with 'chunk_' and vice versa.

## What does it do?
The `up.sql` script modifies existing records in the `events` table by replacing the prefix 'card_' with 'chunk_' in the `event_type` column. This change is applied to all records where the `event_type` value starts with 'card_'.

The `down.sql` script reverts the changes made by `up.sql`. It replaces 'chunk_' with 'card_' in the `event_type` column for all rows where `event_type` starts with 'chunk_'.

Essentially, these scripts manage a database migration that updates how event types are prefixed in the `events` table.
