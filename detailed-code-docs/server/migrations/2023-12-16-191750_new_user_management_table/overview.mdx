## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for managing changes related to user-organization relationships in the application's database. The scripts introduce a new table to represent this relationship as a many-to-many mapping.

## What does it do?
The code defines two database migration scripts:

- **`up.sql`**: This script modifies the database schema to enable a many-to-many relationship between users and organizations. It creates a new table called `user_organizations` to store these relationships and removes the previous one-to-one relationship enforced by the `organization_id` column in the `users` table.
- **`down.sql`**: This script reverses the changes made by `up.sql`, effectively reverting the database schema to its previous state. It removes the `user_organizations` table and reintroduces the `organization_id` column in the `users` table.

These scripts are likely designed to be executed by a database migration tool, which would apply the changes in a controlled and reversible manner.
