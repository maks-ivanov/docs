## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `user_organizations` table and restores the `organization_id` column in the `users` table, effectively undoing a many-to-many relationship between users and organizations.

## Table of contents
- Drop foreign key constraints
- Drop `user_organizations` table
- Add `organization_id` column to `users` table

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE user_organizations DROP CONSTRAINT
#### Description
This command removes the foreign key constraints from the `user_organizations` table.

#### Internal Logic
- Drops the foreign key constraint `fk_user_id` if it exists
- Drops the foreign key constraint `fk_organization_id` if it exists

### DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_organizations
#### Description
This command removes the `user_organizations` table from the database.

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if the `user_organizations` table exists
- If it exists, drops the table and all its contents

### ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN
#### Description
This command adds the `organization_id` column back to the `users` table.

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if the `organization_id` column doesn't already exist in the `users` table
- If it doesn't exist, adds a new column named `organization_id` of type UUID

## Side Effects
- Removes the `user_organizations` table, which may result in data loss if not handled properly
- Modifies the structure of the `users` table by adding a column
- Potentially affects any queries or application logic that relies on the `user_organizations` table or the `organization_id` column in the `users` table

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a data migration step to preserve the information from the `user_organizations` table before dropping it
- Implement a check to ensure that the `organization_id` column doesn't already exist in the `users` table before attempting to add it
- Add error handling or logging to capture any issues that may occur during the migration process
