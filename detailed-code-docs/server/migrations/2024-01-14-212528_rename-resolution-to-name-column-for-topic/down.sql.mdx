## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It renames the `name` column back to `resolution` in the `topics` table.

## Table of contents
- SQL ALTER TABLE statement

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE statement
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `topics` table by renaming a column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command targets the `topics` table.
2. The `RENAME COLUMN` clause is used to change the column name.
3. The column currently named `name` is renamed to `resolution`.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the schema of the `topics` table.
- Any queries or application code referring to the `name` column of the `topics` table will need to be updated to use `resolution` instead.
- Existing data in the column will be preserved, only the column name changes.

## Future Improvements
- Ensure that all related application code and queries are updated to reflect this column name change.
- Consider adding a comment explaining the reason for this renaming, if not already present in the corresponding `up.sql` file.
- If there are any indexes, views, or foreign key constraints using this column, they may need to be updated in separate migration steps.
