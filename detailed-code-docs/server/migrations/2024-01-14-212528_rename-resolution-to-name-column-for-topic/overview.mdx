## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for renaming the `resolution` column to `name` in the `topics` table. Two files, `up.sql` and `down.sql`, manage the forward and reverse migrations, respectively.

## What does it do?
The `up.sql` script renames the `resolution` column in the `topics` table to `name`. This change is applied to the database schema when this migration is run. Conversely, the `down.sql` script reverts this change, renaming the `name` column back to `resolution`. This ensures that the database schema can be rolled back to its previous state if needed. 

These scripts are part of a version control system for database schemas, allowing for controlled and reversible modifications.
