### ALTER TABLE statement
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the 'topics' table by renaming a column.

#### Internal Logic
1. Identifies the 'topics' table
2. Renames the 'resolution' column to 'name'

## Side Effects
- Changes the schema of the 'topics' table
- Any existing queries or code referencing the 'resolution' column will need to be updated to use 'name' instead

## Future Improvements
- Ensure all application code and queries are updated to reflect this column name change
- Consider adding a comment to explain the reason for the rename, if not obvious
- If there are any views or stored procedures referencing this column, they should be updated as well
