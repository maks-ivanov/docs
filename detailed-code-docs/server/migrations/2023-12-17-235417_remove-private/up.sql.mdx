## High-level description
This SQL migration script removes the 'private' column from two tables: 'card_metadata' and 'files'. It's designed to modify the database schema by eliminating a specific attribute from these tables.

## Table of contents
- Alter card_metadata table
- Alter files table

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE card_metadata
#### Description
This SQL command removes the 'private' column from the 'card_metadata' table.

#### Internal Logic
The command uses the `ALTER TABLE` statement to modify the structure of the 'card_metadata' table. The `DROP COLUMN` clause is used to remove the 'private' column entirely from this table.

### ALTER TABLE files
#### Description
This SQL command removes the 'private' column from the 'files' table.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to the previous command, this uses the `ALTER TABLE` statement to modify the 'files' table structure. The `DROP COLUMN` clause is used to remove the 'private' column from this table.

## Side Effects
- The 'private' column and all its data will be permanently removed from both the 'card_metadata' and 'files' tables.
- Any queries, views, or application code that previously relied on the 'private' column in these tables will need to be updated to reflect this change.
- The storage space used by the 'private' column in both tables will be freed.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a comment explaining why the 'private' column is being removed for better documentation.
- If there's a need to preserve the data before removal, consider adding a step to backup the 'private' column data before dropping it.
- If this change is part of a larger restructuring, consider combining it with other related schema changes in a single migration for better coherence.
