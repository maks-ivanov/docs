## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding and removing the `current_period_end` column in the `stripe_subscriptions` table. The `up.sql` script adds the column, while the `down.sql` script reverts the change.

## What does it do?
The `up.sql` migration script modifies the database schema to include a new column named `current_period_end` in the `stripe_subscriptions` table. This column stores the timestamp indicating when the current subscription period ends. 

Conversely, the `down.sql` script undoes this change by removing the `current_period_end` column from the `stripe_subscriptions` table. This effectively reverts the database schema to its state before the addition of the column.
