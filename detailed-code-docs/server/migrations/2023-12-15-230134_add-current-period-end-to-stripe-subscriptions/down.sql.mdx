## Table of contents

### ALTER TABLE statement
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the `stripe_subscriptions` table by removing the `current_period_end` column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the existing `stripe_subscriptions` table.
2. The `DROP COLUMN` clause is used to remove the `current_period_end` column from the table.

## Side Effects
- This migration will permanently remove the `current_period_end` column and all its data from the `stripe_subscriptions` table.
- Any queries or application code relying on the `current_period_end` column will no longer function correctly after this migration is applied.

## Future Improvements
- Ensure that all application code and queries are updated to remove references to the `current_period_end` column before applying this migration.
- Consider adding a backup mechanism to preserve the data in the `current_period_end` column before dropping it, if the information might be needed in the future.
