## High-level description

## Table of contents
- DROP TABLE statement

## Symbols

### DROP TABLE IF EXISTS events;
#### Description
This SQL command is used to delete the `events` table from the database schema. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the operation will not throw an error if the table doesn't exist.

#### Inputs
This command doesn't take any direct inputs.

#### Outputs
This command doesn't produce any direct outputs. However, it results in the removal of the `events` table from the database schema if it exists.

#### Side Effects
- If the `events` table exists, it will be permanently deleted from the database schema.
- All data stored in the `events` table will be lost.
- Any dependencies on the `events` table (such as foreign keys, views, or triggers) may be affected or become invalid.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a backup mechanism before dropping the table to preserve data if needed.
- If there are dependencies on this table, ensure they are properly handled in related migration scripts.
- Consider adding comments explaining why the table is being dropped for better maintainability.
