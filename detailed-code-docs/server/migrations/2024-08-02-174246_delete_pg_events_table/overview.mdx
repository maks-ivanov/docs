## High-level description
This directory contains database migration scripts for managing the `events` table in a PostgreSQL database. The scripts are written in SQL and are designed to be executed sequentially to update the database schema.

## What does it do?
This directory contains two SQL scripts that handle the deletion and recreation of the `events` table in a PostgreSQL database. The `up.sql` script is designed to be run when migrating the database to a newer version and handles the deletion of the `events` table. Conversely, the `down.sql` script is designed to revert this change, recreating the `events` table if rolling back to a previous database version. This approach allows for version-controlled database schema changes.

## Key Files
- **up.sql:** This script drops the `events` table if it exists. It's used to remove the table during a database migration.
- **down.sql:** This script recreates the `events` table with all its columns, constraints, and default values. It effectively reverses the changes made by `up.sql`, restoring the table to its previous state.
