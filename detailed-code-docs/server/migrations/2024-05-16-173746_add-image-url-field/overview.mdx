## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding and removing the `image_urls` column from the `chunk_metadata` table. 

## What does it do?
The `up.sql` script adds a new column named `image_urls` to the `chunk_metadata` table. This column is designed to store an array of text strings, each representing a URL pointing to an image. This allows the application to associate multiple images with each chunk of metadata.

Conversely, the `down.sql` script reverts this change by removing the `image_urls` column from the `chunk_metadata` table. This effectively undoes the migration, deleting the column and any data it contained. 

These scripts are intended to be run in sequence to manage database schema changes over time.
