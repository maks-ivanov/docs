## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `image_urls` column from the `chunk_metadata` table.

## Table of contents
- SQL statement to drop the `image_urls` column

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata DROP COLUMN image_urls
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the `image_urls` column from the `chunk_metadata` table.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a direct SQL statement without parameterized inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This statement modifies the database schema but doesn't return any data.

#### Internal Logic
The statement uses the `ALTER TABLE` command to modify the `chunk_metadata` table structure. The `DROP COLUMN` clause is used to remove the `image_urls` column from the table.

## Side Effects
- Permanently removes the `image_urls` column from the `chunk_metadata` table.
- Any data stored in the `image_urls` column will be lost.
- Applications or queries that depend on the `image_urls` column will need to be updated to avoid errors.

## Performance Considerations
This operation may lock the `chunk_metadata` table for the duration of the column removal, which could impact database performance temporarily, especially for large tables.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a backup mechanism before running this migration to preserve any important data in the `image_urls` column.
- If the `image_urls` data is still needed, consider moving it to another table or format before dropping the column.
