## High-level description
This SQL migration script adds a new column `image_urls` of type `TEXT[]` (an array of text) to the `chunk_metadata` table. This allows for storing multiple image URLs associated with each chunk of metadata.

## Table of contents
- ALTER TABLE statement

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE chunk_metadata ADD COLUMN image_urls TEXT[]
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the existing `chunk_metadata` table by adding a new column named `image_urls`. The new column is defined as an array of TEXT values, which can store multiple URLs for images related to each chunk of metadata.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of an existing table.
2. `chunk_metadata` is the name of the table being altered.
3. `ADD COLUMN` specifies that a new column is being added to the table.
4. `image_urls` is the name of the new column being added.
5. `TEXT[]` defines the data type of the new column as an array of TEXT values.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the structure of the `chunk_metadata` table in the database.
- Existing rows in the `chunk_metadata` table will have a new `image_urls` column with NULL values.
- Any applications or queries that interact with the `chunk_metadata` table will need to be updated to account for the new column.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding an index on the `image_urls` column if it will be frequently queried.
- If the number of image URLs per chunk is expected to be large, consider creating a separate table for image URLs with a foreign key relationship to `chunk_metadata` for better performance and data management.
- Add constraints or validation to ensure that only valid URLs are stored in the `image_urls` column.
