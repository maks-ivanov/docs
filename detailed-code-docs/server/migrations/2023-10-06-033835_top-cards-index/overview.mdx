## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration files for creating and reverting an index on the `vote` column of the `card_votes` table. These migrations are likely part of a larger application that involves voting or rating cards.

## What does it do?
The `up.sql` file creates an index on the `vote` column of the `card_votes` table. This index speeds up queries that filter or sort based on the vote value. For example, finding all cards with a vote greater than 4 will be much faster with the index.

The `down.sql` file reverts the changes made by `up.sql`. It drops the index created on the `vote` column. This is useful for rolling back the migration if needed. 

Essentially, these files optimize how the database retrieves information about card votes, making the application faster and more efficient.
