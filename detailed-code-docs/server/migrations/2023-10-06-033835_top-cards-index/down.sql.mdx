## Symbols

### DROP INDEX idx_card_votes_vote
#### Description
This SQL command removes the index named `idx_card_votes_vote` from the database schema.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
The `DROP INDEX` statement is used to remove an existing index from a database table. In this case, it's removing the index named `idx_card_votes_vote`, which was likely created to improve query performance on the `card_votes` table, specifically for the `vote` column or a combination of columns including `vote`.

## Side Effects
- Removing this index may impact query performance for operations that were previously utilizing this index.
- The database schema is modified, removing the specified index structure.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a safety check to ensure the index exists before attempting to drop it, to prevent potential errors if the migration is run multiple times.
- If the index is critical for certain operations, ensure that alternative optimization strategies are in place or that the impact on query performance is acceptable.
