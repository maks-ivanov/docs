## High-level description
This SQL migration script is designed to revert the changes made by the corresponding `up.sql` file. It removes the `dataset_id` column from the `files` table if it exists.

## Table of contents
- SQL statement to drop the `dataset_id` column

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE Statement
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the `files` table by removing the `dataset_id` column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The statement targets the `files` table.
2. It uses the `DROP COLUMN` clause to remove the `dataset_id` column.
3. The `IF EXISTS` condition is used to prevent errors if the column doesn't exist.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the structure of the `files` table by removing the `dataset_id` column.
- Any data stored in the `dataset_id` column will be permanently lost when this migration is executed.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a backup mechanism before dropping the column to preserve data if needed.
- If there are any foreign key constraints or indexes related to the `dataset_id` column, they should be dropped as well in this migration.
