## High-level description
This SQL migration script adds a new column `dataset_id` to the `files` table and establishes a foreign key relationship between the `files` and `datasets` tables.

## Table of contents
- Add `dataset_id` column to `files` table
- Add foreign key constraint

## Code Structure
The script consists of two SQL ALTER TABLE statements that modify the `files` table.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE files ADD COLUMN dataset_id UUID NOT NULL
#### Description
This statement adds a new column named `dataset_id` to the `files` table.

#### Internal Logic
- The new column is of type UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)
- It is defined as NOT NULL, meaning it must always have a value

### ALTER TABLE files ADD CONSTRAINT files_dataset_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (dataset_id) REFERENCES datasets(id)
#### Description
This statement adds a foreign key constraint to the `files` table, linking the `dataset_id` column to the `id` column in the `datasets` table.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a constraint named `files_dataset_id_fkey`
- Establishes a foreign key relationship between `files.dataset_id` and `datasets.id`
- Ensures referential integrity between the `files` and `datasets` tables

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| datasets table | The target table for the foreign key relationship |

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding an index on the `dataset_id` column in the `files` table to improve query performance, especially if there will be frequent joins or lookups based on this column.
- Evaluate the need for cascading actions (e.g., ON DELETE CASCADE) on the foreign key constraint, depending on the desired behavior when a dataset is deleted.
- If not already present, consider adding a unique constraint or index on the `id` column of the `datasets` table to ensure optimal performance of the foreign key relationship.
