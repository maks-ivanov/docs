### SQL Statement
#### Description
The SQL statement in this migration file is responsible for removing the `organization_id` column from the `datasets` table. It uses the `ALTER TABLE` command with the `DROP COLUMN` clause to achieve this.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the structure of the `datasets` table.
2. The `DROP COLUMN` clause is used to remove the specified column.
3. The `IF EXISTS` condition is added to prevent errors if the column doesn't exist.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the structure of the `datasets` table by removing the `organization_id` column if it exists.
- Any data stored in the `organization_id` column will be permanently lost when this migration is executed.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a backup mechanism before dropping the column to preserve data if needed.
- If foreign key constraints are involved, ensure they are properly handled in the migration process.
