## High-level description
This directory contains database migration scripts for altering the `invitations` table. The migration aims to replace the existing `referral_tokens` column with a new `organization_id` column, establishing a relationship between invitations and organizations.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory modify the structure of the `invitations` table in the database. 

1. **Establish a relationship between invitations and organizations:** It introduces a new column `organization_id` to the `invitations` table. This column will store a unique identifier referencing a corresponding entry in the `organizations` table, effectively linking each invitation to a specific organization.

2. **Remove the referral token mechanism:** It removes the `referral_tokens` column from the `invitations` table. This suggests a shift away from using referral tokens for managing invitations.

The `up.sql` script is designed to apply these changes to the database, while the `down.sql` script reverts the changes, restoring the table to its previous state. 

This change likely signifies a move towards a more structured invitation system where invitations are directly associated with organizations rather than relying on referral tokens.
