## High-level description
This SQL migration script modifies the `topics` table by replacing the `user_id` column with an `owner_id` column. It also creates an index on the `dataset_id` and `owner_id` columns for improved query performance.

## Table of contents
- Add `owner_id` column
- Update `owner_id` with existing `user_id` values
- Drop `user_id` column
- Create index on `dataset_id` and `owner_id`

## Code Structure
The migration script consists of four main SQL statements that are executed sequentially to modify the `topics` table structure.

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE topics ADD COLUMN owner_id
#### Description
This statement adds a new column `owner_id` to the `topics` table.

#### Internal Logic
- Adds a new column named `owner_id` of type TEXT
- Sets the column as NOT NULL
- Provides a default value of '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000' (a UUID)

### UPDATE topics SET owner_id = user_id
#### Description
This statement populates the newly added `owner_id` column with existing values from the `user_id` column.

#### Internal Logic
- Updates all rows in the `topics` table
- Sets `owner_id` to the value of `user_id` where `user_id` is not NULL

### ALTER TABLE topics DROP COLUMN user_id
#### Description
This statement removes the `user_id` column from the `topics` table.

#### Internal Logic
- Drops the `user_id` column from the `topics` table

### CREATE INDEX topics_dataset_id_owner_id_idx
#### Description
This statement creates a new index on the `topics` table for improved query performance.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates an index named `topics_dataset_id_owner_id_idx`
- The index is created on the `dataset_id` and `owner_id` columns of the `topics` table

## Side Effects
- The structure of the `topics` table is permanently modified
- Existing data in the `user_id` column is migrated to the new `owner_id` column
- A new index is created, which may impact storage and query performance

## Performance Considerations
- The creation of the new index (`topics_dataset_id_owner_id_idx`) may improve query performance for operations involving `dataset_id` and `owner_id`
- The migration process, especially the UPDATE statement, may take some time depending on the size of the `topics` table

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a foreign key constraint on the `owner_id` column if it references a user table
- If the default UUID for `owner_id` is meant to represent a system or anonymous user, consider creating a constant or configuration value for this UUID to ensure consistency across the application
