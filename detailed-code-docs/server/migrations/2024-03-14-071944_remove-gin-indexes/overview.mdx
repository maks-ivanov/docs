## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for managing indexes on the `chunk_metadata` table. It includes scripts for both creating and removing various types of indexes, including GIN indexes for text search and JSON data, as well as B-tree indexes for timestamp columns.

## What does it do?
The SQL scripts in this directory are used to modify the structure of the `chunk_metadata` table in a database. One script focuses on creating indexes, which are like lookup tables that help the database find information faster. The other script is designed to remove these indexes. This is often done to optimize performance, as indexes can sometimes slow down data updates. However, the script that removes indexes is currently inactive, meaning it won't actually remove anything unless modified. 

These scripts are likely used as part of a larger database migration process, allowing developers to adjust the database structure in a controlled manner. 

## Key Files
- **`down.sql`**: This script creates various indexes on the `chunk_metadata` table. These indexes are designed to speed up different types of queries, such as text search within specific columns or range queries on timestamp columns.
- **`up.sql`**: This script is intended to remove the indexes created by `down.sql`. However, the commands to remove indexes are currently commented out, meaning the script is inactive and won't make any changes to the database unless the comments are removed.
