## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration files for managing database schema changes related to indexes on specific fields. The primary purpose of these migrations is to improve query performance by creating and dropping indexes as needed.

## What does it do?
The `up.sql` file adds a new index to the `card_metadata` table to speed up searches within the `metadata` column, which contains JSON data. This is particularly useful for complex queries that need to filter or search within the JSON structure. 

Conversely, the `down.sql` file reverts this change by dropping the index. This is essential for rolling back migrations or undoing changes during development. This ensures that the database schema can be easily managed and versioned.
