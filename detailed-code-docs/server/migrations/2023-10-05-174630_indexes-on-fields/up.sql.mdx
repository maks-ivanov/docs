## High-level description
This SQL migration file creates a GIN (Generalized Inverted Index) index on the `metadata` column of the `card_metadata` table. This index is designed to improve query performance for JSON data stored in the `metadata` column.

## Table of contents
- Create GIN index on `card_metadata` table

## Symbols

### `CREATE INDEX json_gin ON card_metadata USING gin (metadata);`
#### Description
This SQL command creates a GIN index named `json_gin` on the `metadata` column of the `card_metadata` table. GIN indexes are particularly useful for indexing columns that contain JSON data, allowing for efficient querying of JSON contents.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| card_metadata | table | The table on which the index is being created |
| metadata | column | The column of the `card_metadata` table being indexed |

#### Internal Logic
1. The database engine creates a GIN index structure for the `metadata` column.
2. The index is optimized for querying JSON data within the column.
3. The index is named `json_gin` for easy reference in future operations or queries.

## Performance Considerations
- GIN indexes are optimized for columns containing JSON or other complex data types.
- This index will significantly improve query performance for operations that search or filter based on the contents of the `metadata` column.
- However, the index will slightly increase storage requirements and may impact the performance of insert, update, and delete operations on the `card_metadata` table.

## Future Improvements
- Monitor the performance impact of this index on write operations. If write performance becomes a concern, consider using partial indexes or exploring other optimization techniques.
- If specific JSON fields within the `metadata` column are frequently queried, consider creating additional indexes on those specific fields using JSON path expressions for even more targeted performance improvements.
