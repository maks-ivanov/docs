title: "down.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to undo the changes made in the corresponding `up.sql` file. It specifically drops a GIN (Generalized Inverted Index) index named `json_gin` if it exists.

## Table of contents
- Drop index statement

## Symbols

### `drop index json_gin if exists;`
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the GIN index named `json_gin` from the database if it exists.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
1. The statement checks if the index named `json_gin` exists in the database.
2. If the index exists, it is dropped (removed) from the database.
3. If the index does not exist, no action is taken, and no error is raised due to the `if exists` clause.

## Side Effects
- Removes the `json_gin` index from the database if it exists.
- May affect query performance for operations that previously utilized this index.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of the `json_gin` index and why it's being dropped.
- If there are multiple indexes being created in the `up.sql` file, ensure all of them are dropped in this `down.sql` file to maintain consistency.
