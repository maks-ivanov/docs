## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for the `users` table. These scripts manage database schema changes related to dropping and restoring a "hash" column and adding a "name" column.

## What does it do?
The scripts in this directory manage changes to how user data is stored in the database. One script (`up.sql`) removes a "hash" column (likely used for storing password hashes) and adds a "name" column. The other script (`down.sql`) reverses these changes, restoring the "hash" column and removing the "name" column. This is essential for database version control, allowing developers to modify the database schema over time while maintaining compatibility. 

## Key Files
- **up.sql:** This script makes the following changes to the `users` table:
    - Removes the `hash` column.
    - Adds a nullable `name` column of type TEXT.
- **down.sql:** This script reverts the changes made by `up.sql`:
    - Adds back the `hash` column as VARCHAR(255) allowing NULL values.
    - Removes the `name` column.
