### ALTER TABLE statement
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the `card_metadata` table by removing the `weight` column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the `card_metadata` table.
2. The `DROP COLUMN` clause is used to remove the `weight` column.
3. The `IF EXISTS` condition is added to prevent errors if the column doesn't exist.

## Side Effects
- Removes the `weight` column from the `card_metadata` table if it exists.
- If the column doesn't exist, the statement will not cause an error and will effectively do nothing.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a comment explaining why this column is being removed, which could be helpful for future maintainers.
- If there are any indexes or constraints related to the `weight` column, they should also be dropped in this migration.
