## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding and removing a 'weight' column from the 'card_metadata' table. 

## What does it do?
These scripts manage database schema changes related to adding a 'weight' attribute to cards. The `up.sql` script adds the 'weight' column to the 'card_metadata' table, while the `down.sql` script reverts this change by removing the column.
