## High-level description
This directory contains database migration files for managing the `files` table. The `up.sql` file defines the structure and properties of the `files` table, while the `down.sql` file provides instructions for reverting these changes.

## What does it do?
The files in this directory are responsible for creating and deleting the `files` table in the database. The `up.sql` file is executed to create the table and define its columns, data types, and constraints. This table stores information about files uploaded by users, including the file name, type, privacy settings, and timestamps. The `down.sql` file, on the other hand, is used to undo the changes made by `up.sql` by dropping the `files` table and removing all associated data. These files are typically used in conjunction with a database migration tool to manage database schema changes over time.
