## High-level description
This SQL script is a database migration file designed to undo the changes made by its corresponding `up.sql` file. It drops the `files` table from the database.

## Table of contents
- DROP TABLE statement

## Symbols

### DROP TABLE files
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `files` table from the database schema.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
The `DROP TABLE` statement is a simple SQL command that completely removes the specified table (`files` in this case) and all its data from the database.

## Side Effects
- Permanently deletes the `files` table and all its contents from the database.
- Removes the table structure, including all columns, indexes, and constraints associated with the `files` table.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a check to ensure the table exists before attempting to drop it, to prevent errors if the migration is run multiple times.
- If data preservation is a concern, consider adding a backup mechanism before dropping the table.
