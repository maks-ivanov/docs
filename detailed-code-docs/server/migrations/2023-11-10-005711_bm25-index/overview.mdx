## High-level description
The `/server/migrations/2023-11-10-005711_bm25-index` directory contains SQL migration files for creating and removing a BM25 search index on the `card_metadata` table. However, the actual index creation is currently commented out and not functional.

## What does it do?
This directory contains two SQL files:

- `up.sql`: This file is intended to create a BM25 index on the `card_metadata` table, likely to enable full-text search functionality. However, the index creation code is currently commented out, and a placeholder statement is used instead. This means the migration will run without errors but won't actually create the index.
- `down.sql`: This file is responsible for undoing the changes made by `up.sql`. It attempts to remove the `idx_content_search` index if it exists. This ensures that running the migration downwards will revert the database to its previous state, even though the index creation is currently inactive.

In essence, this migration directory represents an incomplete attempt to add a BM25 search index to the database. It likely requires further development and configuration to become fully functional.
