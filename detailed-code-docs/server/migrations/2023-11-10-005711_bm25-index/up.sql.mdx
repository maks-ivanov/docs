## High-level description
This SQL migration file is intended to create a BM25 index for full-text search on the `card_metadata` table. However, the actual index creation is commented out, and a placeholder SELECT statement is used instead.

## Table of contents
- Commented-out extension creation
- Commented-out BM25 index creation
- Placeholder SELECT statement

## Code Structure
The file contains three main parts, all of which are currently inactive except for the last one:
1. Extension creation (commented out)
2. BM25 index creation (commented out)
3. Placeholder SELECT statement (active)

## Symbols

### Extension Creation (Commented Out)
#### Description
This line would create the `pg_bm25` extension if it doesn't already exist.

```sql
-- CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_bm25;
```

### BM25 Index Creation (Commented Out)
#### Description
This block would create a BM25 index named `idx_content_search` on the `card_metadata` table.

```sql
-- CREATE INDEX idx_content_search
-- ON card_metadata
-- USING bm25 ((card_metadata.*))
-- WITH (text_fields='{"card_html": {}}');
```

#### Internal Logic
- The index would be created on all fields of the `card_metadata` table.
- It specifically targets the `card_html` field for text search.

### Placeholder SELECT Statement
#### Description
This is a simple SELECT statement that does nothing but ensures the migration runs without errors.

```sql
SELECT 1;
```

## Future Improvements
1. Uncomment and implement the `pg_bm25` extension creation if it's required for the project.
2. Uncomment and adjust the BM25 index creation statement based on the actual requirements:
   - Verify if indexing all fields (`card_metadata.*`) is necessary or if specific fields should be targeted.
   - Confirm if `card_html` is the correct field for text search or if additional fields should be included.
3. Replace the placeholder SELECT statement with actual, meaningful database changes once the requirements are finalized.
4. Consider adding error handling or logging to ensure the migration runs successfully and to track any issues during index creation.
