### DROP INDEX statement
#### Description
This SQL statement removes the index named `idx_content_search` from the database if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `DROP INDEX` command is used to remove an index from the database.
2. The `IF EXISTS` clause is added to prevent errors if the index doesn't exist.
3. The index name `idx_content_search` suggests it was likely created for full-text search functionality, possibly using BM25 algorithm (based on the migration folder name).

## Side Effects
- Removing this index may impact the performance of search queries that were utilizing it.
- The database schema will be modified, removing the specified index structure.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a comment explaining the purpose of the index that's being dropped, to provide context for future developers.
- If there are any dependent objects or queries relying on this index, they should be identified and potentially modified after running this migration.
