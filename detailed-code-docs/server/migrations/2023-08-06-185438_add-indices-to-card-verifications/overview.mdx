## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration files for adding and removing indices on the `card_verification` table. These migrations are likely part of a larger system that manages credit card information and verification processes.

## What does it do?
The files in this directory manage database schema changes related to performance optimization. The `up.sql` file adds an index to the `card_id` column in the `card_verification` table. This index speeds up queries that search or filter based on `card_id`. The `down.sql` file reverses this change by removing the index, allowing for rollback to a previous database state.

## Key Files
- **`up.sql`**: Defines the forward migration, adding an index to the `card_id` column of the `card_verification` table. This is a common performance optimization for frequently queried columns.
- **`down.sql`**: Defines the reverse migration, removing the index added by `up.sql`. This ensures that database changes can be reverted if needed.
