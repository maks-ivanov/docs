### DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_card_verification_card_id
#### Description
This SQL command removes the index named `idx_card_verification_card_id` if it exists in the database.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
The command uses the `DROP INDEX` SQL statement with the `IF EXISTS` clause to safely remove the index without causing an error if it doesn't exist.

## Side Effects
- Removal of the `idx_card_verification_card_id` index from the database schema
- Potential impact on query performance for operations involving the `card_id` column in the `card_verification` table

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a comment explaining the reason for removing this specific index
- If there are multiple indices being removed, consider grouping them together in this file for better organization
