## High-level description
This SQL migration file adds an index to the `card_verification` table to improve query performance on the `card_id` column.

## Table of contents
- Index creation on `card_verification` table

## Symbols

### CREATE INDEX idx_card_verification_card_id
#### Description
This SQL command creates a new index named `idx_card_verification_card_id` on the `card_verification` table, specifically for the `card_id` column.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| card_id | Column | The column in the `card_verification` table on which the index is created |

#### Internal Logic
The index is created using the standard SQL syntax for index creation. It will generate a data structure that allows for faster lookups and queries on the `card_id` column in the `card_verification` table.

#### Performance Considerations
Adding this index will improve query performance for operations that involve searching or filtering on the `card_id` column in the `card_verification` table. However, it may slightly slow down insert, update, and delete operations on this table, as the index will need to be updated along with the table data.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding additional indices if other columns in the `card_verification` table are frequently used in WHERE clauses or JOIN conditions.
- Monitor the performance impact of this index and adjust if necessary, potentially by creating a composite index if multiple columns are often queried together.
- Ensure that this index is also dropped in the corresponding "down" migration file to allow for proper rollback of database changes.
