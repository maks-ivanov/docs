## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for updating the foreign key constraint in the `chunk_group_bookmarks` table. The scripts manage the relationship between `chunk_group_bookmarks` and `chunk_metadata` tables, ensuring data integrity.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory handle changes to how bookmarks are linked to metadata in a database. 

- The `up.sql` script updates the database schema to point the `chunk_group_bookmarks` table to the `chunk_metadata` table. It also sets up automatic deletion and updating of bookmarks when corresponding entries in the `chunk_metadata` table are deleted or updated.
- The `down.sql` script reverses the changes made by `up.sql`, reverting the `chunk_group_bookmarks` table to its previous state. This is essential for rolling back database changes if needed. 

These scripts are designed to be run in sequence, ensuring the database schema is correctly migrated and rolled back when necessary.
