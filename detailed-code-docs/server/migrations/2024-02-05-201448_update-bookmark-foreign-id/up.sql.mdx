## High-level description
This SQL migration script modifies the foreign key constraint in the `chunk_group_bookmarks` table. It removes an existing constraint and adds a new one to establish a relationship with the `chunk_metadata` table, including cascade actions for delete and update operations.

## Table of contents
- Drop existing foreign key constraint
- Add new foreign key constraint

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE chunk_group_bookmarks (First Statement)
#### Description
This statement removes an existing foreign key constraint from the `chunk_group_bookmarks` table.

#### Internal Logic
The constraint named `card_collection_bookmarks_card_metadata_id_fkey` is dropped from the `chunk_group_bookmarks` table.

### ALTER TABLE chunk_group_bookmarks (Second Statement)
#### Description
This statement adds a new foreign key constraint to the `chunk_group_bookmarks` table, linking it to the `chunk_metadata` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. A new constraint named `chunk_group_bookmarks_chunk_metadata_id_fkey` is created.
2. It establishes a foreign key relationship between the `chunk_metadata_id` column in `chunk_group_bookmarks` and the `id` column in `chunk_metadata`.
3. The constraint includes `ON DELETE CASCADE` and `ON UPDATE CASCADE` clauses, ensuring referential integrity is maintained when records in the `chunk_metadata` table are deleted or updated.

## Side Effects
- The relationship between `chunk_group_bookmarks` and the previously referenced table (likely `card_metadata`) is removed.
- A new relationship is established between `chunk_group_bookmarks` and `chunk_metadata`.
- Deleting or updating records in `chunk_metadata` will now cascade to related records in `chunk_group_bookmarks`.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a comment explaining the reason for this change, especially if it's part of a larger refactoring or data model update.
- Ensure that any application code or queries relying on the old relationship are updated to reflect this change.
- Verify that the cascade actions (ON DELETE CASCADE, ON UPDATE CASCADE) align with the intended behavior of the application.
