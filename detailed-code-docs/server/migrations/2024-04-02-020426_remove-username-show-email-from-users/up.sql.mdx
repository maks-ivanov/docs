## High-level description
This SQL migration script removes three columns from the `users` table: `username`, `visible_email`, and `website`. It's designed to simplify the user data structure by eliminating these fields.

## Table of contents
- Remove `username` column
- Remove `visible_email` column
- Remove `website` column

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN username
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `username` column from the `users` table.

#### Internal Logic
The `ALTER TABLE` statement is used to modify the structure of an existing table. The `DROP COLUMN` clause specifically removes a column from the table.

### ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN visible_email
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `visible_email` column from the `users` table.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to the previous command, this uses `ALTER TABLE` with `DROP COLUMN` to remove the `visible_email` column.

### ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN website
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `website` column from the `users` table.

#### Internal Logic
Again, `ALTER TABLE` with `DROP COLUMN` is used to remove the `website` column from the `users` table.

## Side Effects
- The `users` table will no longer contain `username`, `visible_email`, and `website` columns.
- Any data previously stored in these columns will be permanently lost.
- Applications or queries that relied on these columns will need to be updated to avoid errors.

## Performance Considerations
- Dropping columns is generally a quick operation, but the exact performance impact depends on the database system and the size of the `users` table.
- For large tables, this operation might require a table rewrite, which could be time-consuming and resource-intensive.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a corresponding "down" migration to recreate these columns if needed for rollback purposes.
- Ensure that all application code and database queries are updated to reflect the removal of these columns.
- If any of these fields are still needed in the application, consider storing them in a separate table or a different format (e.g., JSON column) depending on the use case.
