## High-level description
This SQL migration file is designed to undo the creation of the `stripe_customers` table. It's a "down" migration that reverses the changes made by the corresponding "up" migration.

## Table of contents
- DROP TABLE statement

## Symbols

### DROP TABLE IF EXISTS stripe_customers
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `stripe_customers` table from the database if it exists.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the command will not throw an error if the table doesn't exist. This makes the migration more robust and idempotent.

## Side Effects
- Permanently removes the `stripe_customers` table and all its data from the database.
- Any dependent objects (like views or foreign keys) referencing this table may be affected or become invalid.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a backup mechanism before dropping the table to prevent accidental data loss.
- If there are any dependent objects, consider adding statements to handle them (e.g., dropping views or foreign keys) before dropping the table.
