## High-level description
This SQL script creates a new table named `stripe_customers` to store information about customers associated with Stripe payments. It establishes a relationship between Stripe customers and users in the system.

## Table of contents
- Table creation
- Column definitions
- Primary key
- Foreign key constraint

## Code Structure
The code consists of a single SQL statement that creates the `stripe_customers` table with specific columns and constraints.

## Symbols

### CREATE TABLE stripe_customers
#### Description
This SQL command creates a new table named `stripe_customers` with columns to store Stripe customer information and establish a relationship with the `users` table.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a DDL statement and doesn't take inputs in the traditional sense)

#### Outputs
N/A (This statement creates a table in the database)

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines the table name as `stripe_customers`
2. Specifies columns with their respective data types and constraints
3. Sets the primary key as the `id` column
4. Establishes a foreign key relationship with the `users` table

## Dependencies
This script assumes the existence of a `users` table in the database, as it references the `email` column from that table.

### Configuration
| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|:------------|
| id | UUID | NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY | Unique identifier for the Stripe customer |
| stripe_id | TEXT | NOT NULL, UNIQUE | Stripe's internal customer ID |
| email | VARCHAR(100) | UNIQUE, DEFAULT NULL | Customer's email address |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | NOT NULL | Timestamp of record creation |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMP | NOT NULL | Timestamp of last record update |

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding indexes on frequently queried columns, such as `stripe_id` or `email`, to improve query performance.
- If the `users` table doesn't exist, ensure it's created before running this migration.
- Depending on the application's needs, consider adding additional columns for storing more customer information, such as name or billing address.
