### ALTER TABLE statement
#### Description
This SQL statement modifies the structure of the `card_verification` table by removing a unique constraint.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the existing `card_verification` table.
2. The `DROP CONSTRAINT` clause is used to remove a constraint from the table.
3. The constraint being removed is named `uq_card_id`.

## Side Effects
- Removing this constraint will allow duplicate values in the column(s) that were previously constrained by `uq_card_id`.
- This may affect data integrity and the uniqueness of records in the `card_verification` table.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a comment explaining why this constraint is being removed, which could be helpful for future maintenance.
- Ensure that any application code relying on the uniqueness of this field is updated accordingly to prevent potential data inconsistencies.
