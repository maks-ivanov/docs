## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for adding and removing a unique constraint on the `card_id` column in the `card_verification` table. 

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory manage a database constraint. One script adds a rule to the database that prevents duplicate `card_id` values from being stored in the `card_verification` table. The other script removes this rule. This is a common practice in software development to keep databases organized and prevent data inconsistencies. 

The script `up.sql` is executed when the migration is applied, while the script `down.sql` is executed when the migration is rolled back.
