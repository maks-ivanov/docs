## Table of contents
- ALTER TABLE statement

### ALTER TABLE statement
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `invitations` table by renaming a column.

#### Internal Logic
1. Targets the `invitations` table
2. Uses the `RENAME COLUMN` clause to change the column name
3. Renames `organization_id` back to `dataset_id`

## Side Effects
- Modifies the schema of the `invitations` table
- May affect any queries or code that rely on the column name `organization_id`

## Future Improvements
- Ensure that all related code and queries are updated to use the reverted column name `dataset_id`
- Consider adding appropriate indexes on the `dataset_id` column if they were removed during the previous migration
