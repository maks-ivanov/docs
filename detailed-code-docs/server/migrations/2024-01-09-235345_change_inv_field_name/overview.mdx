## High-level description
This directory contains SQL migration scripts for renaming the `dataset_id` column to `organization_id` in the `invitations` table. The `up.sql` script applies the change, while the `down.sql` script reverts it.

## What does it do?
These scripts manage a database schema alteration. The `up.sql` script changes the name of a column in the `invitations` table from `dataset_id` to `organization_id`. This suggests a shift in the application's logic, linking invitations to organizations instead of individual datasets. The `down.sql` script reverses this change, renaming the column back to its original name. This is essential for rolling back the database to a previous state if needed.
