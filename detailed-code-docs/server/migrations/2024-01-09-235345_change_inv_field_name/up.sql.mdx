## High-level description
This SQL migration script renames the `dataset_id` column to `organization_id` in the `invitations` table. This change likely reflects a shift in the data model, associating invitations with organizations rather than specific datasets.

### ALTER TABLE statement
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `invitations` table by renaming a column.

#### Internal Logic
1. Identifies the `invitations` table
2. Renames the column `dataset_id` to `organization_id`

## Side Effects
- Changes the schema of the `invitations` table
- May affect any existing queries or code that reference the `dataset_id` column in the `invitations` table

## Future Improvements
- Ensure all application code and queries are updated to use `organization_id` instead of `dataset_id`
- Consider adding a comment to explain the reason for this change, if not already documented elsewhere
- If necessary, update any foreign key constraints or indexes that may have been associated with the `dataset_id` column
