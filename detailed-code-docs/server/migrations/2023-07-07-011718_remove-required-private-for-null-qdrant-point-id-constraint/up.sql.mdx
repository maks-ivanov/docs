### ALTER TABLE statement
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `card_metadata` table by removing a specific constraint.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the `card_metadata` table.
2. The `DROP CONSTRAINT` clause is used to remove the constraint named `qdrant_point_nullable_constraint`.

## Side Effects
- The removal of this constraint may affect data integrity rules previously enforced on the `card_metadata` table.
- Any queries or operations that relied on this constraint being present may need to be reviewed and potentially updated.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding comments to explain why this constraint is being removed and any implications it might have on the application logic.
- If this change is part of a larger refactoring, ensure that corresponding changes are made in the application code that interacts with this table.
- Consider adding a new constraint if necessary to maintain data integrity in a different way, depending on the requirements of the application.
