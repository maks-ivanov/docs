### ALTER TABLE statement
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `organization_usage_counts` table by removing the `chunk_count` column.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command is used to modify the existing `organization_usage_counts` table.
2. The `DROP COLUMN` clause is used to remove the `chunk_count` column from the table.

## Side Effects
- Removes the `chunk_count` column from the `organization_usage_counts` table.
- Any data stored in the `chunk_count` column will be permanently deleted.

## Future Improvements
- Ensure that no critical data is lost when running this migration.
- Consider adding a backup mechanism before running destructive migrations.
- If the `chunk_count` data is valuable, consider archiving it before removal.
