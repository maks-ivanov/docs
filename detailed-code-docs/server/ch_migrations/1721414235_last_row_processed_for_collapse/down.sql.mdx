## High-level description
This SQL script is designed to remove the `last_collapsed_dataset` table from the database if it exists. It's a database migration script, specifically a "down" migration, used to revert changes made by a corresponding "up" migration.

## Table of contents
- DROP TABLE statement

## Symbols

### DROP TABLE IF EXISTS last_collapsed_dataset
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `last_collapsed_dataset` table from the database if it exists. If the table doesn't exist, the command will not raise an error due to the `IF EXISTS` clause.

#### Inputs
This command doesn't take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This command doesn't produce any direct outputs. However, it has the side effect of removing the specified table from the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
1. The database engine checks if a table named `last_collapsed_dataset` exists in the current schema.
2. If the table exists, it is completely removed from the database, including all its data and structure.
3. If the table doesn't exist, the command completes without any action or error.

## Side Effects
- Permanent removal of the `last_collapsed_dataset` table and all its contents from the database, if it exists.
- This action is irreversible within the scope of this script.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a comment explaining the purpose of the `last_collapsed_dataset` table and why it's being dropped.
- If there are any foreign key constraints or dependencies on this table, it might be beneficial to add commands to handle those before dropping the table.
- For larger systems, it might be useful to add logging or output to confirm whether the table was actually dropped or if it didn't exist.
