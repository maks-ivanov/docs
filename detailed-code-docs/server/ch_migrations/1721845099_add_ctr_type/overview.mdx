## High-level description
This directory contains database migration scripts for adding and removing the `type` column in the `ctr_data` table. The directory structure follows a specific naming convention for database migrations, with `up.sql` for applying the migration and `down.sql` for reverting it.

## What does it do?
The scripts in this directory manage a specific change to the database structure: the addition and removal of the `type` column in the `ctr_data` table. The `up.sql` script adds this column as a String type, while the `down.sql` script removes it. These scripts are designed to be executed sequentially by a database migration tool, allowing for controlled and reversible changes to the database schema over time. 

The `up.sql` script modifies the existing `ctr_data` table by adding a new column named `type`. This column is defined as a String data type, allowing it to store textual information. Existing rows in the table will have `NULL` values for the new `type` column unless a default value is explicitly specified.

The `down.sql` script reverts the changes made by `up.sql`. It removes the `type` column from the `ctr_data` table if it exists. The script includes an `IF EXISTS` condition to ensure that the operation only proceeds if the `type` column is present, preventing errors if the column has already been removed. 

These scripts are essential for managing the evolution of the database schema and ensuring that changes can be applied and reverted in a controlled manner, especially in collaborative development environments.
