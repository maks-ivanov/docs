### DROP TABLE IF EXISTS recommendations
#### Description
This SQL command removes the `recommendations` table from the database if it exists. If the table doesn't exist, the command will not raise an error due to the `IF EXISTS` clause.

#### Inputs
This command doesn't take any direct inputs.

#### Outputs
This command doesn't produce any direct outputs. However, it has the side effect of removing the `recommendations` table from the database schema if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `IF EXISTS` clause checks if the `recommendations` table is present in the database.
2. If the table exists, it is completely removed from the database schema.
3. If the table doesn't exist, the command completes without any action or error.

## Side Effects
- Removes the `recommendations` table and all its data from the database if it exists.
- Modifies the database schema.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a backup mechanism before dropping the table to prevent accidental data loss.
- If there are any foreign key constraints referencing this table, they should be handled before dropping the table.
