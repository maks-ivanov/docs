## High-level description
This directory contains database migration scripts for the `recommendations` table in a ClickHouse database. The scripts manage the schema changes required to create and drop the table as part of the application's version control system.

## What does it do?
The directory includes two SQL scripts:

- **up.sql:** Defines the schema and configuration for creating the `recommendations` table. This script is executed when upgrading the database to a version that includes this table.
- **down.sql:** Contains the SQL command to drop the `recommendations` table. This script is executed when rolling back the database to a version prior to the existence of this table.

These scripts ensure that the database schema remains consistent with the application codebase as it evolves. Developers can use these scripts to apply or revert database changes related to the `recommendations` table during development or deployment.
