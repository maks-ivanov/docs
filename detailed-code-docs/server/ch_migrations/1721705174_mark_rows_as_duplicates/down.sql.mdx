## High-level description
This SQL script is designed to revert changes made to the `search_queries` table by removing the `is_duplicate` column. It's part of a database migration system, specifically a "down" migration to undo a previous alteration.

## Table of contents
- ALTER TABLE statement

## Symbols

### ALTER TABLE search_queries
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `search_queries` table by removing the `is_duplicate` column if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` statement targets the `search_queries` table.
2. The `DROP COLUMN` clause is used to remove a column from the table.
3. The `IF EXISTS` condition ensures that the operation only proceeds if the column actually exists, preventing errors if the column has already been removed or never existed.

## Side Effects
- Removes the `is_duplicate` column from the `search_queries` table if it exists.
- Any data stored in the `is_duplicate` column will be permanently lost when this migration is executed.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a backup mechanism before dropping the column to preserve data if needed.
- If the `is_duplicate` information is valuable, consider moving it to another table or implementing a different storage solution before removing the column.
