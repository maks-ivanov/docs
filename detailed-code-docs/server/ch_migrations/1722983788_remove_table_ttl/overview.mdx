## High-level description
This directory contains database migration scripts for managing the Time-To-Live (TTL) settings of five tables in a ClickHouse database. The scripts are designed to be run in sequence to either apply or revert changes related to data retention policies.

## What does it do?
The scripts in this directory control how long data is stored in five specific tables within a ClickHouse database. One script sets a 30-day expiration date on the data, automatically deleting records older than 30 days. The other script removes this automatic expiration, allowing data to be stored indefinitely. This is a common practice in database management to balance storage costs with the need to retain historical data.

## Entry points
- **up.sql**: This script is executed to apply the migration, which in this case means *removing* the TTL setting from the five tables.
- **down.sql**: This script reverts the migration, effectively *reinstating* the 30-day TTL on the five tables.

The naming convention of "up" and "down" is standard for migration scripts, indicating the direction of the change relative to the database schema.
