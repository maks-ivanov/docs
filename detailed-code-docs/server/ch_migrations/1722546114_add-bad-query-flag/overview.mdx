## High-level description
This directory contains database migration scripts for adding and removing the `query_rating` column in the `search_queries` table. The scripts are written in SQL and are designed to be executed sequentially.

## What does it do?
This code manages changes to how search queries are rated in the database. It provides a way to add a new rating system and to revert back to the previous state if needed. The code ensures that the database structure is updated safely, preventing errors if the migration is run multiple times. 

## Key Files
- **up.sql**: This script adds a new column named `query_rating` to the `search_queries` table. The column is designed to store a rating for each search query, likely indicating its quality or relevance.
- **down.sql**: This script reverts the changes made by `up.sql`. It removes the `query_rating` column from the `search_queries` table, effectively rolling back the database schema to its previous state.
