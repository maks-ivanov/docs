## High-level description
This SQL script is designed to revert changes made to the `search_queries` table by removing the `query_rating` column if it exists. It's part of a database migration system, specifically a downgrade script.

### ALTER TABLE statement
#### Description
This SQL command modifies the structure of the `search_queries` table by removing the `query_rating` column if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ALTER TABLE` command targets the `search_queries` table.
2. The `DROP COLUMN` clause specifies that a column should be removed.
3. The `IF EXISTS` condition ensures that the operation only proceeds if the column actually exists, preventing errors if the column has already been removed or never existed.
4. The column to be dropped is named `query_rating`.

## Side Effects
- If the `query_rating` column exists in the `search_queries` table, it will be permanently removed along with all data it contains.
- If the column doesn't exist, the script will execute without making any changes to the table structure.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a comment explaining the purpose of this migration and why the `query_rating` column is being removed.
- If there's valuable data in the `query_rating` column, consider adding a step to backup this data before dropping the column.
