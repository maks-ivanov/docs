## High-level description
This directory contains database migration scripts for managing the `ctr_data` table in a ClickHouse database. The scripts are written in SQL and are designed to be executed by a database migration tool. The directory contains two files: `up.sql` for creating the table and `down.sql` for dropping it.

## What does it do?
The scripts in this directory manage the lifecycle of a database table named `ctr_data`. The `up.sql` script creates the table and defines its structure, including columns for storing data related to click-through rates (CTR) or similar metrics. It also configures the table for efficient querying and data retention using features like partitioning and data expiration policies. The `down.sql` script handles the removal of the `ctr_data` table when it's no longer needed, ensuring a clean uninstallation process.

## Key Files
- **up.sql:** This script is responsible for creating the `ctr_data` table. It defines the table's schema, including columns for unique identifiers (`id`, `request_id`, `chunk_id`, `dataset_id`), position (`position`), metadata (`metadata`), and timestamps (`created_at`). The script also sets up the table's storage engine, ordering, partitioning, and TTL (Time-To-Live) configuration for optimized performance and data management.
- **down.sql:** This script handles the removal of the `ctr_data` table from the database. It uses a conditional drop statement (`DROP TABLE IF EXISTS`) to avoid errors if the table doesn't exist. This script ensures that the database is cleaned up correctly when the `ctr_data` table is no longer required.
