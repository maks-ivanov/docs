## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow, named "main", is designed to automate the release process for a Go project. It runs on pushes to the main branch or manual triggers, and performs tasks such as building the project, creating a release, and uploading artifacts to an S3-compatible storage.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of a single job named "release-main" with multiple steps that handle different aspects of the release process, including checkout, Go setup, running GoReleaser, and uploading artifacts to S3.

## Symbols

### Workflow: main
#### Description
This GitHub Actions workflow automates the release process for a Go project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| push to main branch | event | Triggers the workflow when code is pushed to the main branch |
| workflow_dispatch | event | Allows manual triggering of the workflow |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up concurrency to cancel any in-progress workflows when a new one is triggered.
2. Defines permissions for contents and packages.
3. Runs a single job "release-main" with multiple steps:
   - Checks out the repository
   - Sets up Go environment
   - Runs GoReleaser to create a release
   - Uploads release artifacts to an S3-compatible storage

### Job: release-main
#### Description
This job performs the main release tasks for the project.

#### Internal Logic
1. Runs on Ubuntu 22.04
2. Executes a series of steps:
   - Checkout: Fetches the repository code
   - Set up Go: Prepares the Go environment
   - Run GoReleaser: Creates a release snapshot
   - Upload to S3: Syncs release artifacts to S3-compatible storage

### Step: Checkout
#### Description
Checks out the repository code.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| fetch-depth | integer | Specifies the number of commits to fetch (0 for all) |

### Step: Set up Go
#### Description
Sets up the Go environment for the project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cache | boolean | Disables Go module caching |
| go-version | string | Specifies the Go version to use ("1.23") |

### Step: Run GoReleaser
#### Description
Runs GoReleaser to create a release snapshot.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| distribution | string | Specifies the GoReleaser distribution to use |
| version | string | Sets the version of GoReleaser to use |
| args | string | Provides arguments for the GoReleaser command |

#### Environment Variables
| Name | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| GITHUB_TOKEN | GitHub token for authentication |
| TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN | Token for updating Homebrew tap |

### Step: Upload to S3
#### Description
Uploads release artifacts to an S3-compatible storage.

#### Environment Variables
| Name | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| SOURCE_DIR | Directory containing files to upload |
| DEST_DIR | Destination directory in the S3 bucket |
| AWS_REGION | Region of the S3-compatible storage |
| AWS_S3_BUCKET | Name of the S3 bucket |
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | Access key for S3 authentication |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | Secret key for S3 authentication |
| AWS_S3_ENDPOINT | Endpoint URL for the S3-compatible storage |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v4 | Checks out the repository |
| actions/setup-go@v5 | Sets up the Go environment |
| goreleaser/goreleaser-action@v6 | Runs GoReleaser for creating releases |
| jakejarvis/s3-sync-action@v0.5.1 | Syncs files to S3-compatible storage |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| concurrency.group | string | "main" | Defines the concurrency group for the workflow |
| concurrency.cancel-in-progress | boolean | true | Cancels in-progress workflows when a new one is triggered |

## Error Handling
The workflow does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on GitHub Actions' default behavior of stopping the workflow if any step fails.
