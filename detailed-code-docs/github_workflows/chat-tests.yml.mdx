---

## High-level description
This code defines a GitHub Actions workflow named "chat test suite" that runs on pull requests modifying files in specific directories of a frontend project. It performs build and linting checks on the codebase, specifically targeting the "chat" feature.

## Table of contents
- **Concurrency**
- **On**
- **Jobs**
    - **build-test**
    - **eslint**

## Code Structure
The workflow is triggered `on` pull requests and runs two `jobs`: `build-test` and `eslint`. Both jobs run on the `blacksmith-2vcpu-ubuntu-2204` runner. 

## Symbols
### `name: chat test suite`
#### Description
Defines the name of the workflow as "chat test suite".

### `concurrency`
#### Description
Configures concurrency for the workflow, ensuring that only one workflow run is executed at a time for the same workflow and branch.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| group | string |  A string identifying the workflow group. Uses an expression combining the workflow name and head ref. |
| cancel-in-progress | boolean | If true, cancels any in-progress workflow runs within the same concurrency group. |

### `on`
#### Description
Specifies the events that trigger the workflow.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| pull_request | object | Defines the workflow to trigger on pull request events. |
| paths | array | An array of file paths that trigger the workflow when modified. |

### `jobs`
#### Description
Defines a set of jobs that run in parallel.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| build-test | object | A job that builds and tests the code. |
| eslint | object | A job that runs ESLint on the code. |

### `jobs.&lt;job_id&gt;.runs-on`
#### Description
Specifies the type of runner that the job will execute on.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| runs-on | string | The name of the runner to use. In this case, it's "blacksmith-2vcpu-ubuntu-2204". |

### `jobs.&lt;job_id&gt;.steps`
#### Description
A sequence of tasks that are executed as part of the job.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| uses | string | Uses an action defined in the same repository, a public repository, or a published Docker container image. |
| name | string | A name for the step that will be displayed in the workflow log. |
| working-directory | string | Specifies the working directory of the action. |
| run | string | Runs command-line programs using the operating system's shell. |
| if | string |  Runs a step only when the `if` conditional is met. |
| with | object | A map of input parameters provided to the action. |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v4 | Checks out the repository's code. |
| ataylorme/eslint-annotate-action@1.0.4 | Annotates code with ESLint results. |

## Error Handling
The workflow relies on GitHub Actions' built-in error handling. If any step fails, the workflow run is marked as failed. The `eslint` job uses `if: always()` to ensure the annotation step runs even if linting fails.
