title: "search-tests.yml"
---

## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow file defines two jobs, "build-test" and "eslint", triggered on pull requests modifying files in specific directories of a frontend project. These jobs aim to ensure code quality by running build and linting processes on the codebase, specifically targeting the "search" feature.

## Table of contents
- **Jobs**
    - build-test
    - eslint

## References
This workflow file references the following:
- `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`: This suggests the workflow uses a GitHub secret for authentication.

## Symbols
### `name: search test suite`
#### Description
This line defines the name of the entire workflow as "search test suite".

### `concurrency`
#### Description
This section configures how concurrent workflow runs are handled.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| group | string |  `${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.head_ref }}` - This creates a concurrency group based on the workflow name and the head ref of the triggering event. |
| cancel-in-progress | boolean | `true` - This cancels any in-progress workflow runs that are part of the same concurrency group. |

### `on`
#### Description
This section defines the events that trigger the workflow.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| pull_request | event | This triggers the workflow on pull requests that modify files within the specified paths. |
| paths | array of strings | This specifies the file paths that, when modified in a pull request, will trigger the workflow. |

### `jobs`
#### Description
This section defines the jobs that will be executed within the workflow.

#### Internal Logic
- Each job ("build-test" and "eslint") runs on a specific virtual environment.
- They utilize various actions for checking out code, installing dependencies, and running commands.
- The "eslint" job includes annotating code linting results using a dedicated action.

### `build-test`
#### Description
This job defines a series of steps to build and test the "search" feature of the frontend project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| runs-on | string | `blacksmith-2vcpu-ubuntu-2204` - This specifies the virtual environment to run the job on. |

#### Internal Logic
- It checks out the codebase.
- Installs project dependencies using `yarn`.
- Runs the build process for the "search" feature.

### `eslint`
#### Description
This job defines a series of steps to lint the codebase, specifically targeting the "search" feature.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| runs-on | string | `blacksmith-2vcpu-ubuntu-2204` - This specifies the virtual environment to run the job on. |

#### Internal Logic
- It checks out the codebase.
- Installs project dependencies using `yarn`.
- Runs the linting process for the "search" feature using ESLint.
- Annotates the linting results directly on the code using the `eslint-annotate-action`.

## Dependencies
This workflow file utilizes the following GitHub Actions:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v4 | Checks out the repository's code. |
| ataylorme/eslint-annotate-action@1.0.4 | Annotates ESLint results on the code. |

## Error Handling
The workflow does not implement specific error handling beyond the default behavior of GitHub Actions. If a step fails, the job will fail, and the workflow run will be marked as failed.

## Logging
The workflow relies on the default logging mechanisms of GitHub Actions. Each step's output is captured and displayed in the workflow run logs.
