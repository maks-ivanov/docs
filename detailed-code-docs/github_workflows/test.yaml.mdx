title: "test.yaml"

## High-level description
This YAML file defines a GitHub Actions workflow named "test" that automates the testing process for a Go project. It runs on push and pull request events to the main branch, excluding changes to documentation and tools, and performs validation, building, and testing on both Ubuntu and Windows environments.

## Code Structure
The workflow is structured into a single job named "test" with multiple steps that checkout the code, set up Go, and run various make commands for validation, building, and testing.

### Workflow: test
#### Description
This GitHub Actions workflow is triggered on push and pull request events to the main branch. It sets up the testing environment, builds the project, and runs tests on multiple operating systems.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| push | event | Push events to the main branch |
| pull_request | event | Pull request events to the main branch |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines the trigger events (push and pull request) and paths to ignore.
2. Sets up a matrix strategy for running on multiple operating systems.
3. Checks out the code repository.
4. Sets up the Go environment.
5. Runs validation (only on Ubuntu).
6. Builds the project.
7. Runs tests.

### Job: test
#### Description
This job defines the steps to be executed for testing the project on different operating systems.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| matrix.os | string | Operating system to run the job on |

#### Internal Logic
1. Runs on the specified operating system (Ubuntu 22.04 or latest Windows).
2. Checks out the code repository with a fetch depth of 1.
3. Sets up Go version 1.23 without caching.
4. Runs the "validate" make command only on Ubuntu.
5. Builds the project using the "build" make command.
6. Runs tests using the "test" make command.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v4 | To check out the repository code |
| actions/setup-go@v5 | To set up the Go environment |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| fetch-depth | integer | 1 | Depth of git fetch for checkout |
| cache | boolean | false | Whether to cache Go modules |
| go-version | string | "1.23" | Version of Go to use |

## TODOs
- Consider updating the Go version if a newer stable version is available.
- Evaluate if caching Go modules would be beneficial for performance.
- Review if the paths-ignore list needs to be updated with any new directories.
