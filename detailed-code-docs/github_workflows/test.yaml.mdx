title: "test.yaml"

## High-level description

The `test.yaml` file is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration that automates the testing and building processes for a project. It is triggered on pushes to the `main` branch and on pull requests. The workflow includes jobs for linting, testing, and building a frontend application, testing a Python application across multiple operating systems and Python versions, and checking for typos in the codebase.

## Code Structure

The workflow is divided into three main jobs:

1. **`test_frontend`**: This job handles the linting, testing, and building of the frontend application. It uses Node.js and pnpm for package management and includes steps for setting up the environment, installing dependencies, and running various checks and builds.

2. **`test_python`**: This job tests a Python application across different operating systems and Python versions. It includes steps for setting up the Python environment, installing dependencies, and running linting, type checking, and tests with both minimal and optional dependencies.

3. **`typos`**: This job checks the codebase for typos using the `typos` action.

## Symbols

### `test_frontend`
#### Description
This job is responsible for linting, testing, and building the frontend part of the project. It ensures that the frontend code is clean, functional, and ready for production.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | This job does not take direct inputs but relies on the repository's code and configuration. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | The job does not produce direct outputs but results in a built frontend application. |

#### Internal Logic
- Cancels any previous runs to avoid redundant processes.
- Checks out the repository code.
- Sets up Node.js and pnpm for package management.
- Installs dependencies and performs deduplication if it's a pull request.
- Runs linting, type checking, and tests.
- Builds the frontend application for production and validates the build.

### `test_python`
#### Description
This job tests the Python application across various environments, ensuring compatibility and functionality across different OS and Python versions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| matrix.os | String | The operating system to run the tests on. |
| matrix.python-version | String | The Python version to use for testing. |
| matrix.dependencies | String | The set of dependencies to install (core or core,optional). |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | The job does not produce direct outputs but ensures the Python application is tested across environments. |

#### Internal Logic
- Cancels any previous runs.
- Checks out the repository code.
- Sets up the specified Python version and installs dependencies.
- Copies necessary static files for tests.
- Installs the application with development dependencies and runs linting and type checking.
- Tests the application with both minimal and optional dependencies.

### `typos`
#### Description
This job checks the codebase for typos to maintain code quality and readability.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | This job does not take direct inputs but operates on the repository's code. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | The job does not produce direct outputs but ensures the codebase is free of typos. |

#### Internal Logic
- Cancels any previous runs.
- Checks out the repository code.
- Uses the `typos` action to scan the codebase for typos.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `styfle/cancel-workflow-action@0.12.1` | Cancels previous workflow runs to save resources. |
| `actions/checkout@v4` | Checks out the repository code for the workflow. |
| `pnpm/action-setup@v2` | Sets up pnpm for package management. |
| `actions/setup-node@v4` | Sets up Node.js environment. |
| `turbocache-build/turbocache-action@v1` | Caches build artifacts for faster builds. |
| `actions/setup-python@v5` | Sets up Python environment. |
| `yezz123/setup-uv@v4` | Sets up the `uv` tool for Python virtual environments. |
| `crate-ci/typos@v1.22.9` | Checks the codebase for typos. |

## Error Handling

The workflow does not explicitly define error handling mechanisms beyond the default behavior of GitHub Actions, which marks a job as failed if any step within it fails.

## Logging

The workflow relies on GitHub Actions' built-in logging to provide output for each step, which can be reviewed in the Actions tab of the repository.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
