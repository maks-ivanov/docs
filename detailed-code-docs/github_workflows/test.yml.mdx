## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow, named "cassiopeia", is designed to automate the testing and linting process for a Python project. It runs on push events to the master branch and pull requests targeting the master branch, using multiple Python versions to ensure compatibility.

## Code Structure
The workflow is defined as a single job named "build" with multiple steps that set up the environment, install dependencies, run tests, and report code coverage.

## Symbols

### `name`
#### Description
Defines the name of the GitHub Actions workflow as "cassiopeia".

### `on`
#### Description
Specifies the events that trigger the workflow: pushes to the master branch and pull requests targeting the master branch.

### `jobs.build`
#### Description
Defines the main job of the workflow, named "build".

#### Internal Logic
1. Runs on the latest Ubuntu environment
2. Sets a timeout of 20 minutes
3. Uses a matrix strategy to test with Python versions 3.8 and 3.9

### `jobs.build.steps`
#### Description
Defines the sequence of steps to be executed in the build job.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks out the repository
2. Sets up Python environment
3. Caches pip dependencies
4. Installs project dependencies
5. Runs tests with pytest and generates coverage report
6. Uploads coverage data to Codecov
7. Lists installed packages

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| pytest-cov | For running tests with coverage reporting |
| codecov | For uploading coverage data |
| .[spatial] | Project-specific dependency (likely the main package with spatial extras) |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| python-version | list | [3.8, 3.9] | Python versions to test against |
| timeout-minutes | integer | 20 | Maximum duration for the job |

## Error Handling
The workflow does not implement specific error handling beyond the default behavior of GitHub Actions, which will mark the workflow as failed if any step exits with a non-zero status code.

## Logging
The workflow uses default GitHub Actions logging. The `-vv` flag in the pytest command enables verbose output for test results.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the workflow file.
