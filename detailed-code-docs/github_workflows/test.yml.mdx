## High-level description

The provided YAML file is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration for a project named "cassiopeia". It is designed to automate the process of installing Python dependencies, running tests, and performing linting across multiple Python versions (3.8 and 3.9) whenever there is a push or pull request to the master branch.

## Code Structure

The workflow is structured into a single job named `build`, which is executed on the `ubuntu-latest` runner. The job uses a matrix strategy to test the code against two different Python versions. The steps within the job include checking out the code, setting up the Python environment, caching pip dependencies, installing necessary packages, running tests with coverage, and reporting the results.

## Symbols

### `name: cassiopeia`
#### Description
This defines the name of the workflow as "cassiopeia". It is used for identification purposes within the GitHub Actions interface.

### `on`
#### Description
Specifies the events that trigger the workflow. In this case, the workflow is triggered on pushes and pull requests to the `master` branch.

### `jobs`
#### Description
Defines a collection of jobs to be run as part of the workflow. Here, there is a single job named `build`.

### `build`
#### Description
The main job in the workflow that performs the tasks of setting up the environment, installing dependencies, running tests, and reporting coverage.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| python-version | list | A list of Python versions (3.8, 3.9) to test against. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | None | The job does not produce direct outputs but performs actions like testing and reporting. |

#### Internal Logic
- **Runs-on**: Specifies the environment (`ubuntu-latest`) where the job will run.
- **Timeout-minutes**: Sets a maximum time limit of 20 minutes for the job to complete.
- **Strategy**: Uses a matrix to run the job with different Python versions.
- **Steps**:
  - **Checkout**: Uses the `actions/checkout@v2` action to clone the repository.
  - **Set up Python**: Configures the Python environment using `actions/setup-python@v2`.
  - **Cache pip**: Caches pip dependencies to speed up subsequent runs.
  - **Install dependencies**: Installs necessary Python packages including `pytest-cov`, `codecov`, and any additional dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt`.
  - **Test with pytest**: Runs tests using `pytest` with coverage reporting.
  - **After success**: Uploads coverage reports to `codecov` and lists installed packages.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `actions/checkout@v2` | Checks out the repository code. |
| `actions/setup-python@v2` | Sets up the specified Python version. |
| `actions/cache@v2` | Caches dependencies to improve workflow efficiency. |
| `pytest-cov` | A pytest plugin for measuring code coverage. |
| `codecov` | A tool for uploading code coverage reports. |

## Error Handling

The workflow does not explicitly define error handling mechanisms. However, GitHub Actions will automatically fail the workflow if any step returns a non-zero exit code, which is typical for CI/CD pipelines.

## Logging

GitHub Actions provides built-in logging for each step in the workflow. The `pytest` command is run with the `-vv` flag to increase verbosity, which provides detailed output for each test case.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
