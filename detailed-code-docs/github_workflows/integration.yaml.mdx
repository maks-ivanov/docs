## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow file defines an integration testing process for a Go project. It runs on both Ubuntu and Windows environments, triggered by pushes to the main branch and pull requests, excluding changes to documentation and tools.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of a single job named "integration" that runs on multiple operating systems. It includes steps for checking out the code, setting up Go, building the project, and running integration tests.

### Workflow: integration
#### Description
This workflow automates the integration testing process for the project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| push | event | Triggered on pushes to the main branch |
| pull_request | event | Triggered on pull requests to the main branch |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines the trigger events (push and pull request) and paths to ignore.
2. Sets up a matrix strategy for running on multiple operating systems.
3. Checks out the code repository.
4. Sets up the Go environment.
5. Builds the project (different commands for Ubuntu and Windows).
6. Runs integration tests.

### Job: integration
#### Description
Defines the steps for running integration tests on multiple operating systems.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| matrix.os | string | Operating system to run the job on |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses a matrix strategy to run on Ubuntu 22.04 and Windows.
2. Checks out the code with a fetch depth of 1.
3. Sets up Go version 1.23 without caching.
4. Builds the project using different commands based on the OS.
5. Runs integration tests using the `make integration` command.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v4 | Checks out the repository code |
| actions/setup-go@v5 | Sets up the Go environment |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| fetch-depth | integer | 1 | Depth of git fetch for checkout |
| cache | boolean | false | Disables caching for Go setup |
| go-version | string | "1.23" | Specifies the Go version to use |

## Performance Considerations
The workflow uses a matrix strategy to run tests on multiple operating systems in parallel, which can improve overall execution time.
