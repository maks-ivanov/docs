## High-level description

The `.github/workflows` directory contains a collection of GitHub Actions workflow configuration files. These files automate various processes related to the development, testing, and release of a project. The workflows are designed to handle tasks such as checking Contributor License Agreement (CLA) compliance, publishing development and production releases, posting updates to Discord, running Playwright tests, and testing both frontend and backend components across different environments.

## What does it do?

The workflows in this directory automate several key processes:

1. **CLA Compliance**: The `cla.yml` workflow ensures that contributors have signed the Contributor License Agreement before their contributions can be merged. It is triggered by pull request and issue comment events.

2. **Development Release**: The `dev-release.yml` workflow automates the process of publishing a development release to Test PyPI and npm. It is triggered by pushes to the `main` branch and involves building the project, patching version numbers, and uploading artifacts.

3. **Discord Notifications**: The `discord-release.yml` workflow posts a message to a Discord channel whenever a new release is published on GitHub. It uses a Discord webhook to send the message.

4. **Playwright Testing**: The `playwright.yml` workflow runs Playwright tests on the project. It is triggered by pushes to the `main` branch and pull requests, and it includes steps for setting up the environment, running tests, and uploading results.

5. **Production Release**: The `release.yml` workflow automates the release process for the project. It is triggered by a push event with a tag matching a semantic versioning pattern and includes steps for building the project and publishing artifacts to PyPI and npm.

6. **General Testing**: The `test.yaml` workflow handles testing and building processes for the project. It includes jobs for linting, testing, and building the frontend, testing the Python application across multiple environments, and checking for typos.

7. **CLI Testing**: The `test_cli.yaml` workflow tests the command-line interface of the project. It builds a Python wheel, tests the CLI across different operating systems, and runs example and smoke tests.

These workflows ensure that the project is consistently tested, built, and released, while also providing notifications and compliance checks to maintain quality and legal standards.
