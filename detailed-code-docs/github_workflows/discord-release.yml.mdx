## High-level description

The target file, `.github/workflows/discord-release.yml`, is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration file. Its primary purpose is to automate the process of posting a message to a Discord channel whenever a new release is published on the GitHub repository. This is achieved by using a specific GitHub Action that sends a message to a Discord webhook.

## Code Structure

The workflow is structured into a single job named `github-releases-to-discord`, which runs on the latest version of Ubuntu. It consists of two main steps: checking out the repository and posting a message to Discord using a predefined GitHub Action.

## Symbols

### `name: Post Release To Discord`
#### Description
This is the name of the GitHub Actions workflow. It provides a human-readable identifier for the workflow, indicating its purpose, which is to post release information to Discord.

### `on: release`
#### Description
This section specifies the event that triggers the workflow. In this case, the workflow is triggered by the `release` event, specifically when a release is published.

### `jobs: github-releases-to-discord`
#### Description
This defines a job within the workflow. The job is named `github-releases-to-discord` and contains the steps necessary to perform the task of posting to Discord.

### `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`
#### Description
This specifies the environment in which the job will run. The job is set to run on the latest version of Ubuntu available on GitHub Actions.

### `steps`
#### Description
This section contains the individual steps that the job will execute. Each step is defined with a name and an action or command to be executed.

#### `- name: ‚¨áÔ∏è Checkout repo`
- **Description**: This step uses the `actions/checkout@v4` action to check out the repository's code. This is a common first step in workflows to ensure that the codebase is available for subsequent steps.

#### `- name: üìß Post to Discord`
- **Description**: This step uses the `SethCohen/github-releases-to-discord@v1.15.0` action to post a message to a Discord channel. It requires several inputs, including a Discord webhook URL, a color for the message, a username, and an avatar URL.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| webhook_url | string | The Discord webhook URL used to send the message. |
| color | string | The color of the message embed in Discord, specified as a string representing a color code. |
| username | string | The username that will appear as the sender of the message in Discord. |
| avatar_url | string | The URL of the avatar image that will appear next to the username in Discord. |

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|

| `SethCohen/github-releases-to-discord@v1.15.0` | Used to post a message to a Discord channel via a webhook. |

## References

The target file does not directly reference other parts of the codebase. However, it relies on GitHub Actions and a specific action (`SethCohen/github-releases-to-discord`) to perform its tasks.

## Error Handling

The workflow does not explicitly define error handling mechanisms. However, GitHub Actions typically provide logs and status updates that can be used to diagnose issues if the workflow fails.

## Logging

GitHub Actions automatically logs the output of each step, which can be reviewed in the Actions tab of the GitHub repository. This logging is inherent to the GitHub Actions platform and does not require additional configuration in the workflow file.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
