## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow, named "Validate docs build", is designed to validate the documentation build process for a project. It runs on push events to the main branch and on pull requests targeting the main branch, ensuring that documentation changes are validated before merging.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of a single job named "validate-docs" with a series of steps that set up the environment, install dependencies, and run validation commands for the project's documentation.

### `validate-docs` (job)
#### Description
This job runs on the latest Ubuntu runner and executes a series of steps to validate the documentation build process.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks out the repository
2. Sets up Go programming language
3. Initializes documentation dependencies
4. Validates the documentation build

### Steps
#### 1. Checkout repository
```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0
```
This step checks out the entire repository history using the `actions/checkout@v4` action.

#### 2. Setup Go
```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-go@v5
  with:
    cache: false
    go-version: "1.23"
```
This step sets up the Go programming language environment using version 1.23, with caching disabled.

#### 3. Initialize documentation
```yaml
- run: make init-docs
```
This step runs a make command to initialize the documentation dependencies.

#### 4. Validate documentation
```yaml
- run: make validate-docs
```
This step runs a make command to validate the documentation build.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v4 | To check out the repository |
| actions/setup-go@v5 | To set up the Go programming language environment |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| fetch-depth | integer | 0 | Fetches all history for all branches and tags |
| cache | boolean | false | Disables caching for Go setup |
| go-version | string | "1.23" | Specifies the version of Go to use |

## TODOs
- The workflow uses Go version "1.23", which is not a valid Go version as of the current date. This should be updated to a valid and appropriate Go version for the project.
