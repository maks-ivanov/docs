### `service.yaml`
#### Description
This YAML file defines a Kubernetes Service resource, which provides a way to access an application running in a set of Pods. The service load balances traffic across the Pods with matching labels.

#### Inputs
This code snippet doesn't take direct inputs. It uses template variables `$NAME` and potentially others from the context where this template is used.

#### Outputs
A Kubernetes Service object will be created upon applying this configuration to a Kubernetes cluster.

#### Internal Logic
The service uses `ClusterIP` type, making the application accessible only from within the cluster. It defines two ports:
- `9000`: mapped to port `9000` on the target Pods, likely the main application port.
- `42625`: mapped to port `42625` on the target Pods, possibly a secondary interface.

The `selector` field ensures that the service routes traffic to Pods with matching labels `app.kubernetes.io/name: $NAME` and `app.kubernetes.io/instance: trieve`.

## Configuration
This code snippet itself doesn't define explicit configuration options. However, it relies on template variables like `$NAME` which suggests that the actual configuration is dynamically generated.

## API/Interface Reference
This code defines a Kubernetes Service object. Refer to the official Kubernetes documentation for details on the Service API: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/
