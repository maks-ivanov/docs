## High-level description
This code defines a Kubernetes Deployment named `$NAME` using a template, likely generated by Helm. It describes a single-container pod with environment variables, volume mounts, and a service account. The container image is dynamically determined based on the environment.

### `deployment.yaml`
#### Description
This YAML file defines a Kubernetes Deployment, which manages a replicated, scalable set of Pods. It ensures a specified number of Pod replicas run at any given time, handling updates and rollouts.

#### Inputs
This template uses values provided by a Helm chart, likely during installation or upgrade.

#### Outputs
A Kubernetes Deployment object named `$NAME` will be created in the cluster.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Metadata:** Defines deployment metadata like name and labels for selection and management.
2. **Spec:** Specifies the desired state of the Deployment.
    - **Selector:**  Used to identify which Pods the Deployment manages.
    - **Template:** Defines the Pod template used to create new Pods.
        - **Metadata:**  Sets labels for the Pods.
        - **Spec:** Defines the Pod's specifications.
            - **Containers:** Describes the container within the Pod, including its name, image, ports, volume mounts, and environment variables.
                - The image source is determined based on the `environment` value.
            - **Volumes:** Defines persistent volumes for the Pod.

## Side Effects
- Creates a Kubernetes Deployment in the current namespace.
- Creates a PersistentVolumeClaim named `$NAME-pvc`.

## Dependencies
- Kubernetes API (`apps/v1` for Deployment)

### Configuration
Configuration is provided through a Helm values file (`.Values`). Key options include:
| Option | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `Release.Name` | Name of the Helm release. |
| `accountId` | AWS account ID (used for ECR image URLs). |
| `region` | AWS region (used for ECR image URLs). |
| `environment` | Environment identifier (determines image source). |
| `containers.$NAME.tag` | Docker image tag for the container. |
| `config.fixme` | Value for the `ENV_VAR` environment variable. |
