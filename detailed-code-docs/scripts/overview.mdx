## High-level description

The `scripts` directory contains development utilities designed to be executed from the root directory of the project. These utilities are intended to assist developers in managing and maintaining the codebase, particularly in the context of the Marimo framework.

## What does it do?

The primary functionality provided by the `scripts` directory is encapsulated in the `print_banned_cell_names.py` script. This script is responsible for identifying and printing a list of reserved keywords that should not be used as cell names within a Marimo application. It achieves this by combining reserved keywords from both the Marimo framework and Python's built-in keywords, formatting them, and then printing the list. This helps developers avoid naming conflicts and ensures that cell names do not clash with reserved terms.

## Entry points

The main file in this directory is `print_banned_cell_names.py`. This script is organized using the Marimo framework, which structures the code into "cells" that encapsulate specific functionalities. Each cell is a function decorated with `@app.cell`, and these cells are executed in sequence to perform the script's tasks. The data flow involves importing necessary modules, defining reserved keywords, formatting them, and finally printing the combined list.

## Key Files

- **`print_banned_cell_names.py`**: This is the core script in the directory. It defines and prints reserved keywords that should not be used as cell names in a Marimo application. The script is structured into several key components:
  - **`format_keywords`**: A function that formats a list of keywords for printing.
  - **`RESERVED_BY_MARIMO`**: A list of keywords reserved by the Marimo framework.
  - **`RESERVED_BY_PYTHON`**: A list of Python's reserved keywords, retrieved using the `keyword` module.
  - **`print_reserved_keywords`**: A function that combines and prints the reserved keywords.
  - **`import_keyword_module`**: A function that imports the Python `keyword` module.

## Dependencies

The script relies on the following external libraries:

- **Marimo**: This framework is used to create and manage the application and its cells. It provides the structure for defining and executing the script's functionalities.
- **keyword**: A standard Python module used to access Python's list of reserved keywords. This module is essential for retrieving Python's built-in reserved terms, which are then combined with Marimo's reserved keywords.
