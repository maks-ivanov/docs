## High-level description

The `scripts/print_banned_cell_names.py` script is designed to identify and print a list of reserved keywords that should not be used as cell names in a Marimo application. It combines reserved keywords from both the Marimo framework and Python's built-in keywords, and then formats and prints them using a defined function.

## Code Structure

The script is structured using the Marimo framework, which allows for the definition of "cells" that encapsulate specific functionality. Each cell is a function decorated with `@app.cell`, and these cells are executed in a sequence to achieve the desired functionality. The main components include functions for formatting keywords, defining reserved keywords by Marimo and Python, and printing the combined list of these keywords.

## Symbols

### `format_keywords`
#### Description
This function takes a list of strings and prints each string on a new line. It is used to format the list of reserved keywords before printing.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| l | list[str] | A list of strings representing keywords. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| format_keywords | function | The function itself is returned for use in other cells. |

#### Internal Logic
The function uses the `print` function with `'\n'.join(l)` to print each keyword on a new line.

### `RESERVED_BY_MARIMO`
#### Description
This cell defines a list of keywords reserved by the Marimo framework, which should not be used as cell names.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| RESERVED_BY_MARIMO | list[str] | A list of reserved keywords specific to Marimo. |

### `RESERVED_BY_PYTHON`
#### Description
This cell retrieves Python's reserved keywords using the `keyword` module and combines them into a list.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| keyword | module | The Python `keyword` module. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| RESERVED_BY_PYTHON | list[str] | A list of Python's reserved keywords. |

### `print_reserved_keywords`
#### Description
This cell combines the reserved keywords from Marimo and Python, formats them using the `format_keywords` function, and prints them.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| RESERVED_BY_MARIMO | list[str] | Marimo's reserved keywords. |
| RESERVED_BY_PYTHON | list[str] | Python's reserved keywords. |
| format_keywords | function | The function to format and print the keywords. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | None | This cell does not return a value. |

### `import_keyword_module`
#### Description
This cell imports the Python `keyword` module, which is used to access Python's reserved keywords.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| keyword | module | The imported `keyword` module. |

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Used to create and manage the application and its cells. |
| keyword | Used to access Python's list of reserved keywords. |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the `keyword` module is available and that the Marimo framework functions as expected.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone script.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
