## High-level description
The `version.py` file is a simple script that defines a version number for a software application or module. It also includes a mechanism to print this version number when the script is executed directly.

## Symbols

### `version`
#### Description
The `version` symbol is a string variable that holds the version number of the software. This is typically used to track the release or iteration of the software.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | N/A         |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| version | str | The version number of the software, represented as a string. |

### `__name__ == '__main__'`
#### Description
This is a common Python idiom used to determine if the script is being run as the main program. If true, it executes the code block that follows, which in this case prints the version number.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | N/A         |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | N/A         |

#### Internal Logic
- The script checks if the special variable `__name__` is set to `'__main__'`, which indicates that the script is being run directly (not imported as a module).
- If the condition is true, it executes the `print(version)` statement, outputting the version number to the console.

## Side Effects
- When executed directly, the script prints the version number to the standard output.

## Dependencies
There are no external dependencies for this script. It uses only built-in Python functionality.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this script, as it performs a straightforward operation that is unlikely to fail under normal circumstances.

## Logging
There is no logging implemented in this script.

## API/Interface Reference
This script does not expose an API or interface. It is a standalone script intended to be executed directly to display the version number.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
