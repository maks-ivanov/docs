## High-level description
This Python file defines and stores the version number of a software project. It also includes a simple script to print the version when the file is run directly.

## Symbols

### `version`
#### Description
A string variable that holds the current version number of the software.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| version | str | The version number of the software |

## Main Script
The file includes a conditional block that executes when the script is run directly (not imported as a module).

### Description
When the script is run as the main program, it prints the `version` to the console.

### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the script is being run as the main program using the `__name__ == '__main__'` condition.
2. If true, it prints the `version` using the `print()` function.

## Usage
This file can be used in two ways:
1. Imported as a module in other Python scripts to access the `version` variable.
2. Run directly as a script to print the current version number.

## Performance Considerations
This is a simple script with minimal performance impact. It's primarily used for version management and doesn't involve any computationally intensive operations.
