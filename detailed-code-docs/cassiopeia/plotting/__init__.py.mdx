## High-level description
This code defines the `__init__.py` file for the `cassiopeia.plotting` package, which provides utilities for visualizing phylogenetic trees. It imports and re-exports specific functions and classes from submodules to make them directly accessible at the package level.

## References
This file references symbols from the following files:
- `cassiopeia/plotting/itol_utilities.py`
- `cassiopeia/plotting/local.py`
- `cassiopeia/plotting/local_3d.py`

## Symbols
### Symbol Name
#### `__all__`

#### Description
A list of symbols to be exported when using `from cassiopeia.plotting import *`. This allows users to directly access these functions and classes without needing to know the specific submodules where they are defined.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a variable definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a variable definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The list includes the following symbols:
- `upload_and_export_itol`: Uploads a tree to the iTOL web service and exports the visualization. (from `itol_utilities.py`)
- `plot_matplotlib`: Generates a static plot of a tree using Matplotlib. (from `local.py`)
- `plot_plotly`: Generates a dynamic plot of a tree using Plotly. (from `local.py`)
- `labels_from_coordinates`: Creates a synthetic labels array from cell coordinates for 3D plotting. (from `local_3d.py`)
- `Tree3D`: A class for creating and manipulating 3D projections of trees onto 2D surfaces. (from `local_3d.py`)
