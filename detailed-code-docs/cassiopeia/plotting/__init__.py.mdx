## High-level description

The `cassiopeia/plotting/__init__.py` file serves as the top-level module for the plotting functionalities within the Cassiopeia library. It imports and exposes several plotting utilities and classes from other modules within the `cassiopeia.plotting` package. These utilities facilitate the visualization of phylogenetic trees using different plotting libraries and methods, including iTOL, Matplotlib, Plotly, and 3D plotting with Pyvista.

## Code Structure

The file imports specific functions and classes from three different modules within the `cassiopeia.plotting` package:
- `itol_utilities.py`: Provides functions for uploading and exporting tree visualizations using the iTOL service.
- `local.py`: Contains functions for plotting trees locally using Matplotlib and Plotly.
- `local_3d.py`: Includes utilities for 3D plotting of trees.

The `__all__` list is defined to specify the public API of the module, which includes the imported functions and classes.

## Symbols

### `upload_and_export_itol`
#### Description
This function is imported from `itol_utilities.py` and is used to upload a phylogenetic tree to the iTOL (Interactive Tree Of Life) service and export the visualization to a local file. It supports additional features like adding metadata, allele tables, and customizing the visualization.

### `plot_matplotlib`
#### Description
Imported from `local.py`, this function generates static plots of phylogenetic trees using Matplotlib. It allows for various customizations, including the orientation of the tree, metadata annotations, and color mappings.

### `plot_plotly`
#### Description
Also from `local.py`, this function creates interactive plots of phylogenetic trees using Plotly. It provides similar customization options as `plot_matplotlib` but with the added interactivity that Plotly offers.

### `labels_from_coordinates`
#### Description
This function, imported from `local_3d.py`, generates a synthetic labels array for 3D plotting based on spatial coordinates of cells in a phylogenetic tree. It is useful for visualizing trees in a 3D space.

### `Tree3D`
#### Description
A class from `local_3d.py` that provides functionalities for 3D visualization of phylogenetic trees using Pyvista. It supports rendering trees on a 2D surface with 3D effects and includes various methods for interacting with the visualization.

## References

- `itol_utilities.py`: Provides the `upload_and_export_itol` function.
- `local.py`: Provides the `plot_matplotlib` and `plot_plotly` functions.
- `local_3d.py`: Provides the `labels_from_coordinates` function and `Tree3D` class.

## Dependencies

The file itself does not directly use any external libraries, but the imported modules rely on several libraries such as Matplotlib, Plotly, Pyvista, and others for their functionalities.

## Configuration

There are no configuration options defined in this file. Configuration, if any, would be handled in the individual modules from which functions and classes are imported.

## Error Handling

The file does not implement any error handling mechanisms. Error handling is expected to be managed within the imported functions and classes.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in this file. Logging, if necessary, would be handled in the respective modules.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in this file.
