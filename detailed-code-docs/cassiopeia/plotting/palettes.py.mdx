## High-level description

The target file `palettes.py` is a simple Python script that defines a color palette named `godsnot_102`. This palette is a list of 102 hexadecimal color codes intended for use in plotting and visualization tasks. The file is designed to provide a set of colors without requiring the `scanpy` library as a dependency.

## Code Structure

The file contains a single list, `godsnot_102`, which is a collection of color codes. There are no functions, classes, or other complex structures in this file. The list is intended to be used directly by importing it into other scripts or modules that require a color palette for plotting.

## Symbols
