## High-level description
This file provides utility functions for generating visualizations of phylogenetic trees using the iTOL (Interactive Tree Of Life) web interface. It includes functions for uploading trees and associated data to iTOL, exporting the visualizations, and creating various data files that iTOL uses for customization, such as gradient files, colorbars, and indel heatmaps.

## Code Structure
The code consists of several functions that are used to create files for iTOL and one main function, `upload_and_export_itol`, which orchestrates the process of uploading a tree and associated data to iTOL and exporting the visualization. The other functions are called by `upload_and_export_itol` to create the necessary data files.

## References
This code references the `CassiopeiaTree` class from `cassiopeia.data` and the `Itol` and `ItolExport` classes from the `itolapi` package. It also uses utility functions from `cassiopeia.plotting.utilities` for color manipulation and data preparation.

## Symbols

### `upload_and_export_itol`
#### Description
Uploads a phylogenetic tree to iTOL and exports the visualization to a local file. This function handles the entire process of preparing the tree and associated data for iTOL, uploading it, and exporting the visualization in the desired format.

#### Inputs

| itol_config | str | Path to the iTOL configuration file containing API key and project name. Defaults to "~/.itolconfig". |
| api_key | Optional[str] | iTOL API key. If not provided, it will be read from the `itol_config` file. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any values. It uploads the tree and associated data to iTOL and exports the visualization to the specified file.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Credentials:** The function first checks for iTOL API key and project name, either provided as arguments or read from the `itol_config` file.
2. **Temporary Directory:** A temporary directory is created to store the files that will be uploaded to iTOL.
3. **Tree File:** The tree is written to a Newick format file in the temporary directory.
4. **Data Files:** Additional data files are created based on the provided arguments:
    - **Indel Heatmap:** If `allele_table` is provided, a set of files for the indel heatmap is created using `create_indel_heatmap`.
    - **Metadata:** For each metadata column in `meta_data`, a gradient file or a colorbar file is created depending on the data type, using `create_gradient_from_df` or `create_colorbar` respectively.
5. **Upload:** The tree file and all data files are uploaded to iTOL using the `itolapi` package.
6. **Export:** The visualization is exported to the specified file using the `itolapi` package, with the specified format and parameters.
7. **Cleanup:** The temporary directory is removed.

#### Side Effects
- Creates a temporary directory and files within it.
- Uploads data to the user's iTOL account.
- Creates a local file containing the exported visualization.

### `create_gradient_from_df`
#### Description
Creates a gradient file for iTOL from a pandas Series containing numerical data. The gradient file defines a color gradient that iTOL uses to color leaves based on the numerical values.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| df | pd.Series | Pandas Series containing numerical data. |
| tree | CassiopeiaTree | CassiopeiaTree object. |
| dataset_name | str | Name of the dataset. |
| output_directory | str | Directory where the gradient file will be saved. Defaults to "./tmp/". |
| color_min | str | Hex color code for the minimum value. Defaults to "#ffffff". |
| color_max | str | Hex color code for the maximum value. Defaults to "#000000". |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| outfp | str | Path to the created gradient file. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Leaf Data:** The function extracts the numerical data for the leaves of the tree from the input Series.
2. **File Content:** It creates a pandas DataFrame with two columns: "cellBC" (leaf names) and "gradient" (numerical values).
3. **Header:** It constructs a header for the gradient file according to the iTOL format.
4. **File Writing:** It writes the header, followed by the DataFrame content in tab-separated format, to the output file.

### `create_colorbar`
#### Description
Creates a colorbar file for iTOL from a pandas Series containing categorical data. The colorbar file defines a color mapping for each unique category, which iTOL uses to color leaves.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| labels | pd.DataFrame | Pandas Series containing categorical data. |
| tree | CassiopeiaTree | CassiopeiaTree object. |
| colormap | Dict[str, Tuple[int, int, int]] | Dictionary mapping categories to RGB color tuples. |
| dataset_name | str | Name of the dataset. |
| output_directory | str | Directory where the colorbar file will be saved. Defaults to ".tmp/". |
| create_legend | bool | Whether to include a legend for the colorbar in the iTOL visualization. Defaults to False. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| outfp | str | Path to the created colorbar file. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Leaf Data:** The function extracts the categorical data for the leaves of the tree from the input Series.
2. **Color Mapping:** It converts the RGB color tuples in the `colormap` to iTOL's "rgb(R,G,B)" format.
3. **File Content:** It creates a pandas DataFrame with two columns: "cellBC" (leaf names) and "color" (color strings).
4. **Header:** It constructs a header for the colorbar file according to the iTOL format.
5. **Legend:** If `create_legend` is True, it adds legend information to the header, including legend title, shapes, colors, and labels.
6. **File Writing:** It writes the header, followed by the DataFrame content in tab-separated format, to the output file.

### `create_indel_heatmap`
#### Description
Creates a set of files for displaying an indel heatmap alongside the tree in iTOL. Each file corresponds to a character (cut site) in the allele table and defines a color mapping for the indels observed at that site.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| alleletable | pd.DataFrame | Allele table containing indel information. |
| tree | CassiopeiaTree | CassiopeiaTree object. |
| dataset_name | str | Name of the dataset. |
| output_directory | str | Directory where the heatmap files will be saved. |
| indel_colors | Optional[pd.DataFrame] | DataFrame mapping indels to HSV color tuples. If not provided, random colors are generated. |
| indel_priors | Optional[pd.DataFrame] | DataFrame containing prior probabilities for each indel. Used for color mapping if `indel_colors` is not provided. |
| random_state | Optional[np.random.RandomState] | Random state for reproducibility. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| allele_files | List[str] | List of paths to the created heatmap files. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Lineage Profile:** The function converts the allele table to a lineage profile using `utilities.prepare_alleletable`.
2. **Color Mapping:** If `indel_colors` is not provided, it generates random colors for each unique indel using `utilities.get_random_indel_colors` or `utilities.get_indel_colors` based on `indel_priors`.
3. **Heatmap Data:** It creates a numpy array representing the heatmap, where each row corresponds to a leaf and each column corresponds to a character. The array values are RGB color tuples based on the indel observed at each position.
4. **File Writing:** For each character, it creates a colorbar file similar to `create_colorbar`, using the corresponding column from the heatmap array as the color data. The file names are formatted as "indelColors_0{character_index}.txt".
