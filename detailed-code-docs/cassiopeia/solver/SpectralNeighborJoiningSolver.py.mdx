## High-level description
The `SpectralNeighborJoiningSolver` class in Cassiopeia implements a phylogenetic tree reconstruction algorithm based on the spectral neighbor-joining method. It iteratively joins pairs of nodes (or groups of nodes) based on the second singular value of a specific matrix derived from the pairwise similarities between nodes. This process continues until a complete tree is formed.

## Code Structure
The `SpectralNeighborJoiningSolver` class inherits from the `DistanceSolver` class. It overrides the `find_cherry` and `update_dissimilarity_map` methods to implement the spectral neighbor-joining logic. The `_compute_svd2` method is a helper function used to calculate the second singular value of the relevant matrix.

## References
This solver references the `dissimilarity_functions` module for calculating pairwise similarities between nodes and the `solver_utilities` module for helper functions like generating unique node names.

## Symbols

### `SpectralNeighborJoiningSolver`
#### Description
This class implements the spectral neighbor-joining algorithm for phylogenetic tree reconstruction. It uses a spectral method to identify pairs of nodes to join based on their pairwise similarities.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| similarity_function | Optional[Callable[[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, int, Dict[int, Dict[int, float]]], float]] | A function to compute the pairwise similarity between nodes. Defaults to `exponential_negative_hamming_distance`. |
| add_root | bool | Whether to add an implicit root to the tree. Defaults to `False`. |
| prior_transformation | str | The transformation to apply to priors when calculating weights. Defaults to `"negative_log"`. |

#### Outputs
The solver populates the `tree` attribute of the input `CassiopeiaTree` object with the reconstructed tree.

#### Internal Logic
The solver iteratively performs the following steps:
1. **Calculate the dissimilarity map:** This map stores the pairwise dissimilarities between all nodes.
2. **Find a cherry:** Using the `find_cherry` method, the solver identifies the pair of nodes with the smallest second singular value of their corresponding RA matrix (see `_compute_svd2` for details).
3. **Update the dissimilarity map:** The `update_dissimilarity_map` method updates the dissimilarity map to reflect the newly joined cherry.
4. **Repeat steps 2-3 until only two nodes remain.**
5. **Root the tree:** If `add_root` is `True`, the solver adds an implicit root to the tree.

### `get_dissimilarity_map`
#### Description
This method obtains or generates the initial dissimilarity map used by the solver. It calls the parent class's `get_dissimilarity_map` method and then constructs the initial lambda matrix, where each subset is a singleton leaf node.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cassiopeia_tree | CassiopeiaTree | The CassiopeiaTree object passed into `solve`. |
| layer | Optional[str] | Layer storing the character matrix for solving. If None, the default character matrix is used. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| lambda_matrix_df | pd.DataFrame | The initial lambda matrix, structured similarly to the `dissimilarity_map` in `DistanceSolver`. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Obtain the similarity map:** Calls the parent class's `get_dissimilarity_map` method to get the pairwise similarities between nodes.
2. **Prepare for the lambda matrix:** Initializes the `_lambda_indices` attribute, which stores the subsets of nodes being considered. Initially, each subset is a singleton leaf node.
3. **Generate the lambda matrix:** Iterates through all pairs of subsets and calculates the second singular value of their corresponding RA matrix using the `_compute_svd2` method.
4. **Convert to DataFrame:** Converts the lambda matrix from a NumPy array to a Pandas DataFrame.

### `find_cherry`
#### Description
This method finds the pair of nodes (or subsets of nodes) to join into a cherry based on the lambda matrix. The cherry is identified as the pair with the smallest second singular value in the lambda matrix.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dissimilarity_map | np.ndarray | The lambda matrix. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (i, j) | Tuple[int, int] | A tuple of indices representing the rows in the lambda matrix corresponding to the nodes to be joined. |

### `_compute_svd2`
#### Description
This method calculates the second largest singular value of the RA matrix for a given pair of subsets of nodes. The RA matrix is constructed based on the pairwise similarities between nodes in the subsets and their complements.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| pair | Tuple[int, int] | A tuple of indices representing the rows in the lambda matrix corresponding to the two subsets of nodes. |
| lambda_indices | List[List[int]] | The list of subsets of nodes being considered. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| svd2_val | float | The second largest singular value of the RA matrix for the given pair of subsets. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Get the combined subset:** Combines the two subsets of nodes specified by the `pair` argument.
2. **Get the complement:** Identifies the nodes that are not in the combined subset.
3. **Reconstruct the RA matrix:** Constructs the RA matrix based on the pairwise similarities between nodes in the combined subset and its complement.
4. **Calculate the second largest singular value:** Computes the singular value decomposition of the RA matrix and returns the second largest singular value.

### `update_dissimilarity_map`
#### Description
This method updates the lambda matrix after a cherry is formed. It removes the rows and columns corresponding to the joined nodes and adds a new row and column for the newly formed cherry. The entries in the new row and column are calculated using the `_compute_svd2` method.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| similarity_map | pd.DataFrame | The lambda matrix to update. |
| cherry | Tuple[str, str] | The names of the two nodes that were joined into a cherry. |
| new_node | str | The name of the newly formed cherry node. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| lambda_matrix_df | pd.DataFrame | The updated lambda matrix. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Identify cherry nodes:** Finds the indices of the cherry nodes in the lambda matrix.
2. **Modify names and indices:** Updates the node names and `_lambda_indices` attribute to reflect the newly formed cherry.
3. **Extract the old lambda matrix:** Removes the rows and columns corresponding to the joined nodes from the lambda matrix.
4. **Add new row and column:** Adds a new row and column to the lambda matrix for the newly formed cherry.
5. **Compute new singular values:** Calculates the second singular values for the new row and column using the `_compute_svd2` method.
6. **Regenerate lambda matrix:** Constructs a new DataFrame from the updated lambda matrix.

### `setup_root_finder`
#### Description
This method defines the implicit rooting strategy for the solver. It adds an implicit root with all-zero character states to the character matrix and recomputes the dissimilarity map.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cassiopeia_tree | CassiopeiaTree | The CassiopeiaTree object passed into `solve`. |

#### Internal Logic

2. **Recompute dissimilarity map:** Computes the dissimilarity map using the updated character matrix.

### `root_tree`
#### Description
This method roots the tree by adding an edge between the last two remaining nodes and converting the undirected graph to a directed graph with respect to the specified root sample.

#### Inputs

| root_sample | str | The name of the sample to treat as the root. |
