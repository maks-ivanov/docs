## High-level description
The `HybridSolver` class in Cassiopeia implements a hybrid approach to phylogenetic tree reconstruction. It combines a top-down greedy solver with a more precise bottom-up solver to efficiently infer relationships in large datasets. The greedy solver is applied initially to cluster cells until a specified cutoff is reached (either based on the number of cells or the distance to the latest common ancestor). Then, the bottom solver is used to reconstruct subtrees for each cluster, resulting in a complete tree.

## Code Structure
The `HybridSolver` class inherits from the `CassiopeiaSolver` class and utilizes two solver instances: `top_solver` (a subclass of `GreedySolver`) and `bottom_solver` (any subclass of `CassiopeiaSolver`). The `solve` method orchestrates the hybrid solving process, while `apply_top_solver` and `apply_bottom_solver` handle the respective solver applications. `assess_cutoff` determines when to switch from the top solver to the bottom solver.

## References
- `GreedySolver`: The `HybridSolver` relies on a `GreedySolver` instance for the initial top-down clustering.
- `CassiopeiaSolver`: Both `top_solver` and `bottom_solver` are subclasses of `CassiopeiaSolver`, providing a common interface for tree reconstruction.
- `CassiopeiaTree`: The `HybridSolver` operates on a `CassiopeiaTree` object, which stores the character matrix, priors, and the resulting tree.

## Symbols

### `HybridSolver`
#### Description
This class implements the hybrid phylogenetic tree reconstruction algorithm. It combines a greedy top-down solver with a more precise bottom-up solver to handle large datasets efficiently.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| top_solver | GreedySolver.GreedySolver | An algorithm to be applied at the top of the tree. Must be a subclass of GreedySolver. |
| bottom_solver | CassiopeiaSolver.CassiopeiaSolver | An algorithm to be applied at the bottom of the tree. Must be a subclass of CassiopeiaSolver. |
| lca_cutoff | float | Distance to the latest-common-ancestor (LCA) of a subclade to be used as a cutoff for transitioning to the bottom solver. |
| cell_cutoff | int | Number of cells in a subclade to be used as a cutoff for transitioning to the bottom solver. |
| threads | int | Number of threads to be used. This corresponds to the number of subproblems to be run concurrently with the bottom solver. |
| prior_transformation | str | Function to use when transforming priors into weights. |
| progress_bar | bool | Indicates if a progress bar should be shown when `solve` is called. |

#### Outputs
The `HybridSolver` does not directly return any outputs. It modifies the input `CassiopeiaTree` object by populating it with the reconstructed tree.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Apply Top Solver:** The `apply_top_solver` method is used to recursively cluster cells using the `top_solver` until the specified cutoff is reached (either `lca_cutoff` or `cell_cutoff`).
2. **Generate Subproblems:** As the top solver clusters cells, it generates subproblems, each consisting of a subtree root and a list of samples within that subtree.
3. **Apply Bottom Solver:** The `apply_bottom_solver` method is applied to each subproblem, using the `bottom_solver` to reconstruct the subtree for the corresponding samples.
4. **Combine Subtrees:** The resulting subtrees are combined into a single tree, forming the complete reconstructed phylogeny.
5. **Add Duplicates and Prune:** Duplicate samples are added to the tree, and any spurious leaves (not present in the original character matrix) are pruned.
6. **Populate CassiopeiaTree:** The final reconstructed tree is used to populate the input `CassiopeiaTree` object.

#### Side Effects
- Modifies the input `CassiopeiaTree` object by populating it with the reconstructed tree.
- Creates log files for each subproblem solved by the bottom solver.

### `apply_top_solver`
#### Description
This method recursively applies the top solver to cluster cells until the specified cutoff is reached.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| character_matrix | pd.DataFrame | Character matrix |
| samples | List[str] | Samples in the subclade of interest. |
| tree | nx.DiGraph | In progress tree for the HybridSolver. |
| node_name_generator | Generator[str, None, None] | Generator for creating unique node names while applying the top-solver. |
| weights | Optional[Dict[int, Dict[int, float]]] | Weights of character-state combinations, derived from priors if these are available. |
| missing_state_indicator | int | Indicator for missing data |
| root | Optional[int] | Node ID of the root in the subtree containing the samples. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| root | int | The ID of the node serving as the root of the tree containing the samples. |
| subproblems | List[Tuple[int, List[str]]] | A list of subproblems in the form [subtree-root, subtree-samples]. |
| tree | nx.DiGraph | The updated tree with the top solver applied. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Base Case:** If there is only one sample, return the sample ID, an empty list of subproblems, and the unmodified tree.
2. **Perform Split:** Use the `top_solver` to partition the samples based on the character matrix and weights.
3. **Create Root:** Generate a unique node name for the root of the current subtree.
4. **Handle Single Clade:** If the split results in a single clade, connect all samples in the clade to the root and return.
5. **Recursive Application:** For each clade resulting from the split:
    - If the cutoff is reached, add the clade as a subproblem.
    - Otherwise, recursively apply `apply_top_solver` to the clade, connect the resulting subtree to the current root, and add any new subproblems.
6. **Return Results:** Return the root ID, the list of subproblems, and the updated tree.

### `apply_bottom_solver`
#### Description
This method applies the bottom solver to a given subproblem, reconstructing the subtree for the corresponding samples.

#### Inputs

| cassiopeia_tree | CassiopeiaTree | CassiopeiaTree for the entire dataset. This will be subsetted with respect to the samples specified. |
| root | int | Identifier of the root in the master tree |
| samples | List[str] | A list of samples for which to infer a tree. |
| logfile | str | Base location for logging output. A specific logfile will be created from this base logfile name. |

|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| subproblem_tree | nx.DiGraph | A tree in the form of a Networkx graph for the subproblem. |
| root | int | The original root identifier. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Base Case:** If there is only one sample, create a simple tree with the root connected to the sample and return.
2. **Subset Character Matrix:** Extract the relevant portion of the character matrix corresponding to the input samples.
3. **Create Subtree:** Create a new `CassiopeiaTree` object for the subproblem, using the subsetted character matrix and priors from the original tree.
4. **Solve Subproblem:** Apply the `bottom_solver` to the subtree, reconstructing the phylogeny for the subproblem samples.
5. **Connect to Root:** Connect the root of the reconstructed subtree to the input root ID.
6. **Return Results:** Return the reconstructed subtree and the original root ID.

    - Calculate the LCA character states for the samples.
    - Calculate the Hamming distance between each sample's character states and the LCA character states.
    - If the maximum distance is less than or equal to the `lca_cutoff`, return True.

## Logging
The `solve` method creates log files for each subproblem solved by the bottom solver. The base file name for the log files is specified by the `logfile` argument, and a unique identifier is appended to each file name.

## TODOs
None.
