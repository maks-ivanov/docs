## High-level description
The `SpectralSolver` class in `SpectralSolver.py` provides a method for reconstructing phylogenetic trees using a spectral algorithm. It leverages the similarity between samples based on shared mutations to partition them recursively, ultimately building a tree structure. This approach aims to minimize the separation of samples with shared mutations while accounting for the size of each partition.

## Code Structure
The `SpectralSolver` class inherits from the `GreedySolver` class. It primarily overrides the `perform_split` method to implement its specific partitioning logic using a spectral algorithm. The `SpectralSolver` utilizes functions from `graph_utilities` to construct and manipulate similarity graphs.

## References
This code references the following symbols:
- `GreedySolver` (from `cassiopeia.solver.GreedySolver`)
- `dissimilarity_functions` (from `cassiopeia.solver`)
- `graph_utilities` (from `cassiopeia.solver`)

## Symbols

### `SpectralSolver`
#### Description
This class implements a spectral algorithm for phylogenetic tree reconstruction. It inherits from `GreedySolver` and overrides the `perform_split` method to partition samples based on a similarity graph.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| similarity_function | Optional[Callable[[int, int, pd.DataFrame, int, Optional[Dict[int, Dict[str, float]]]], float]] | A function to calculate similarity between samples (default: `hamming_similarity_without_missing`). |
| threshold | Optional[int] | Minimum similarity threshold for graph edges (default: 0). |
| prior_transformation | str | Transformation function for priors (default: "negative_log"). |

#### Outputs
This class doesn't directly return any output. It modifies the input `CassiopeiaTree` object during the `solve` method.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Initialization:** Sets the similarity threshold, similarity function, and prior transformation.
2. **`perform_split` Method:**
    - Constructs a similarity graph using `graph_utilities.construct_similarity_graph`.
    - Computes the normalized Laplacian matrix of the graph.
    - Calculates the second eigenvector of the Laplacian matrix (Fiedler vector).
    - Orders nodes based on their corresponding values in the Fiedler vector.
    - Finds the optimal partition index that minimizes the normalized cut.
    - Improves the initial partition using `graph_utilities.spectral_improve_cut`.
    - Returns the left and right partitions.
3. **`solve` Method (inherited from `GreedySolver`):**
    - Prepares data and weights.
    - Recursively partitions the samples using `perform_split` until individual samples are reached.
    - Constructs the tree by connecting the partitions with ancestral nodes.
    - Populates the input `CassiopeiaTree` with the reconstructed tree.

#### Side Effects
The `solve` method modifies the input `CassiopeiaTree` object by populating its tree structure.

#### Performance Considerations
The spectral algorithm's performance depends on the size and structure of the similarity graph. Larger datasets might require more computational resources. The `spectral_improve_cut` function performs a greedy hill-climbing optimization, which could be computationally intensive for complex graphs.
