## High-level description
The `MaxCutSolver` class is a subclass of `GreedySolver` that implements a graph-based algorithm for inferring phylogenetic trees. It aims to find an optimal partition of samples based on their shared and differing mutations, represented as a connectivity graph, by approximating the max-cut problem.

## Code Structure
The `MaxCutSolver` class inherits from `GreedySolver` and overrides the `perform_split` method. It utilizes the `construct_connectivity_graph`, `evaluate_cut`, and `max_cut_improve_cut` functions from the `graph_utilities` module to construct and manipulate the connectivity graph.

## Symbols
### MaxCutSolver
#### Description
This class implements the MaxCut algorithm for phylogenetic tree inference. It inherits from the `GreedySolver` class and provides a concrete implementation for the `perform_split` method.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sdimension | Optional[int] | The number of dimensions for the embedding space (default: 3) |
| iterations | Optional[int] | The number of iterations for updating the embeddings (default: 50) |
| prior_transformation | str | The transformation function to apply to priors (default: "negative_log") |

#### Outputs
This class doesn't directly return any output. It modifies the input `CassiopeiaTree` object during the `solve` method.

#### Internal Logic
The `perform_split` method performs the following steps:
1. **Construct Connectivity Graph:** It builds a connectivity graph where nodes represent samples and edge weights represent the difference between the number of triplets separating and grouping the samples based on shared mutations.
2. **Embed Samples:** Randomly embed the samples in a d-dimensional sphere.
3. **Update Embeddings:** Iteratively update the embeddings based on edge weights, pulling together nodes with strong negative connections and pushing apart nodes with positive connections.
4. **Find Max Cut:** Generate random hyperplanes to bisect the d-sphere and select the one that maximizes the cut weight, effectively partitioning the samples.
5. **Improve Cut:** Apply a greedy hill-climbing procedure to further optimize the cut by iteratively moving nodes between partitions to maximize the cut weight.

#### Performance Considerations
The performance of the algorithm is influenced by the `sdimension` and `iterations` parameters. Higher values may lead to better solutions but increase computational cost.

### evaluate_cut
#### Description
This function calculates the weight of a cut in a graph.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cut | List[str] | A list of nodes representing one side of the cut |
| G | nx.DiGraph | The graph on which the cut is evaluated |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cut_score | float | The total weight of edges crossing the cut |

#### Internal Logic
The function iterates through each edge in the graph and checks if it crosses the cut (i.e., if one node is in the `cut` list and the other is not). If an edge crosses the cut, its weight is added to the `cut_score`.

### Side Effects
This function has no side effects.
