## High-level description
The `PercolationSolver` class implements a top-down, percolation-based algorithm for reconstructing phylogenetic trees. It recursively partitions a set of samples based on their similarity in observed mutations, creating a tree structure where similar samples are grouped closer together.

## Code Structure
The `PercolationSolver` class is initialized with a joining solver, prior transformation function, similarity function, and a threshold. The `solve` method orchestrates the tree reconstruction process by recursively partitioning the sample set using the `percolate` method. The `percolate` method constructs a similarity graph, removes edges based on similarity, and partitions the graph into clades. If more than two clades are formed, the `joining_solver` is used to cluster them. Finally, the `__add_duplicates_to_tree` method adds duplicate samples to the tree.

## Symbols

### `PercolationSolver`
#### Description
This class implements the Percolation algorithm for phylogenetic tree reconstruction. It takes a character matrix and optional priors as input and builds a tree by recursively partitioning the sample set based on their similarity in observed mutations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| joining_solver | CassiopeiaSolver.CassiopeiaSolver | The CassiopeiaSolver used to cluster groups of samples if percolation produces more than two groups. |
| prior_transformation | str | A string specifying the transformation to apply to the priors. Defaults to "negative_log". |
| similarity_function | Optional[Callable[[np.array, np.array, int, Optional[Dict[int, Dict[int, float]]]], float]] | A function that calculates the similarity score between two samples. Defaults to `hamming_similarity_without_missing`. |
| threshold | Optional[int] | The minimum similarity threshold for adding an edge in the similarity graph. Defaults to 0. |

#### Outputs
This class doesn't directly return any output. It modifies the input `CassiopeiaTree` object to store the reconstructed tree.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Initialization:** The class is initialized with a joining solver, prior transformation function, similarity function, and a threshold.
2. **Solve:** The `solve` method orchestrates the tree reconstruction process.
    - It first extracts the character matrix and transforms the priors into weights if provided.
    - It then creates a NetworkX graph and recursively partitions the sample set using the `percolate` method.
    - Finally, it adds duplicate samples to the tree and populates the input `CassiopeiaTree` object.
3. **Percolate:** The `percolate` method partitions a set of samples into two groups based on their similarity.
    - It constructs a similarity graph with samples as nodes and edges weighted by their similarity.
    - It then iteratively removes the minimum weighted edges until the graph is disconnected into multiple components.
    - If more than two components are formed, it clusters them using the `joining_solver` and returns the two resulting groups.
4. **Add Duplicates:** The `__add_duplicates_to_tree` method adds duplicate samples to the tree by finding groups of samples with identical character states and placing them as sister nodes under a new internal node.

#### Side Effects
- Modifies the input `CassiopeiaTree` object to store the reconstructed tree.

### `percolate`
#### Description
Partitions a set of samples into two groups based on their similarity in the character matrix.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| character_matrix | pd.DataFrame | The character matrix representing the mutation profiles of the samples. |
| samples | List[str] | A list of sample names to be partitioned. |
| priors | Optional[Dict[int, Dict[int, float]]] | A dictionary of prior probabilities for each character/state pair. |
| weights | Optional[Dict[int, Dict[int, float]]] | A dictionary of weights for each character/state pair, typically derived from the priors. |
| missing_state_indicator | int | The character representing missing data in the character matrix. Defaults to -1. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| partition_named | Tuple[List[str], List[str]] | A tuple containing two lists of sample names, representing the left and right partitions. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Similarity Graph:** Constructs a weighted graph with samples as nodes and edges weighted by their similarity calculated using the provided `similarity_function`.
2. **Percolation:** Iteratively removes the minimum weighted edges until the graph is disconnected into multiple connected components.
3. **Component Merging (if necessary):** If more than two connected components are formed, it clusters them using the `joining_solver` based on the LCA of each component and returns the two resulting groups.
4. **Return Partitions:** Returns a tuple containing two lists of sample names, representing the left and right partitions.

### `__add_duplicates_to_tree`
#### Description
Adds duplicate samples to the tree.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tree | nx.DiGraph | The tree to which duplicate samples need to be added. |
| character_matrix | pd.DataFrame | The character matrix representing the mutation profiles of the samples. |
| node_name_generator | Generator[str, None, None] | A generator object that produces unique node names. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tree | nx.DiGraph | The tree with duplicate samples added. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Identify Duplicates:** Identifies groups of samples with identical character states in the character matrix.
2. **Add Duplicates:** For each group of duplicates:
    - Creates a new internal node as the parent of the duplicates.
    - Connects the original sample and all its duplicates as children of this new internal node.
3. **Return Tree:** Returns the modified tree with the duplicate samples added.
