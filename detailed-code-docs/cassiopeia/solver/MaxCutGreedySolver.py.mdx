## High-level description
The `MaxCutGreedySolver` class, inheriting from `GreedySolver`, implements a phylogenetic tree reconstruction algorithm that combines a greedy approach with a max-cut optimization. It recursively partitions samples based on the most frequent mutation and then refines the split using a hill-climbing method to maximize the weight of edges cut in a connectivity graph built from shared mutations.

## Code Structure
The `MaxCutGreedySolver` class overrides the `perform_split` method of its parent class, `GreedySolver`. It leverages the `compute_mutation_frequencies` method from the parent class and utilizes functions like `construct_connectivity_graph` and `max_cut_improve_cut` from the `graph_utilities` module.

## Symbols
### `MaxCutGreedySolver`
#### Description
This class implements the MaxCut Greedy algorithm for phylogenetic tree reconstruction. It extends the basic GreedySolver by adding a max-cut optimization step to each split.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| missing_data_classifier | Callable | Function to handle missing data during character splits (default: `missing_data_methods.assign_missing_average`). |
| prior_transformation | str |  Transformation function for converting priors to weights (default: `"negative_log"`). |

#### Outputs
This class doesn't directly return any output. It populates a `CassiopeiaTree` object during the `solve` method (inherited from `GreedySolver`).

#### Internal Logic
The core logic resides in the `perform_split` method:
1. **Identify Splitting Character/State:** It identifies the most frequent character/state pair, considering potential weights derived from priors.
2. **Initial Split:** Samples are initially partitioned based on the chosen character/state.
3. **Handle Missing Data:** The `missing_data_classifier` function is used to assign samples with missing data to either side of the partition.
4. **Construct Connectivity Graph:** A connectivity graph is built where nodes represent samples and edge weights reflect the similarity based on shared mutations.
5. **Max-Cut Optimization:** The `max_cut_improve_cut` function refines the initial split by iteratively moving nodes between partitions to maximize the weight of edges cut, effectively grouping samples with similar mutations.
6. **Return Refined Split:** The optimized left and right partitions are returned.

### `perform_split`
#### Description
This method partitions a set of samples based on the most frequent mutation and optimizes the split using the max-cut criterion.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| character_matrix | pd.DataFrame | Character matrix containing character states for each sample. |
| samples | List[int] | List of samples to be partitioned. |
| weights | Optional[Dict[int, Dict[int, float]]] | Weights for each (character, state) pair, usually derived from priors. |
| missing_state_indicator | int | Character representing missing data (default: -1). |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| improved_left_set | List[str] | List of samples in the left partition after optimization. |
| improved_right_set | List[str] | List of samples in the right partition after optimization. |

#### Internal Logic
See the 'Internal Logic' section of the `MaxCutGreedySolver` class description.

## Side Effects
The `perform_split` method modifies the input `left_set` and `right_set` lists in-place during the missing data imputation and max-cut optimization steps.

## Dependencies
This code depends on the following external libraries:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| pandas | Handling and manipulating character matrices. |
| networkx | Constructing and manipulating graphs for representing relationships between samples. |
| numpy | Numerical operations, particularly in calculating scores and frequencies. |

## Error Handling
This code does not implement specific error handling beyond what is inherited from the parent class `GreedySolver`.
