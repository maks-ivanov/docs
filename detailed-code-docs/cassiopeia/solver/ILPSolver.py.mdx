## High-level description
The `ILPSolver` class implements the Cassiopeia-ILP algorithm for inferring a maximum parsimony phylogenetic tree. It constructs a potential graph of possible evolutionary states and uses Gurobi, an ILP solver, to find the maximum parsimony Steiner Tree within this graph. This tree represents the proposed phylogenetic relationship between the input samples.

## Code Structure
The `ILPSolver` class inherits from the `CassiopeiaSolver` abstract class. It overrides the `solve` method to implement the Cassiopeia-ILP algorithm. The main steps involve inferring a potential graph, generating a Steiner Tree ILP model, solving the ILP problem, post-processing the solution, and populating the resulting tree in a `CassiopeiaTree` object.

#### Description
This class implements the Cassiopeia-ILP algorithm for phylogenetic tree inference.

#### Inputs

| convergence_time_limit | int | Amount of time allotted to the ILP for convergence (default: 12600 seconds). |
| convergence_iteration_limit | int | Number of iterations allowed for ILP convergence (default: 0, meaning no limit). |
| maximum_potential_graph_layer_size | int | Maximum size allowed for an iteration of the potential graph inference procedure (default: 10000). |
| maximum_potential_graph_lca_distance | Optional[int] | Maximum height of LCA to add to the potential graph (default: None, meaning the maximum distance between any pair of samples is used). |
| weighted | bool | Whether to weight edges on the potential graph by the negative log likelihood of the mutations (default: False). |
| seed | Optional[int] | Random seed to use during ILP optimization (default: None). |
| mip_gap | float | Objective gap for mixed integer linear programming problem (default: 0.01). |
| prior_transformation | str | Function to use when transforming priors into weights (default: "negative_log"). |

#### Outputs
The `solve` method does not return any value but populates the provided `CassiopeiaTree` object with the inferred tree.

#### Internal Logic
The `solve` method performs the following steps:
1. **Preprocessing:** Checks for ambiguous states, prepares the character matrix, and transforms priors into weights if necessary.
2. **Root Identification:** Identifies the root of the tree based on the least common ancestor of all samples.
3. **Potential Graph Inference:** Infers the potential graph using the `infer_potential_graph` method.
4. **Steiner Tree Model Generation:** Generates a Gurobi ILP model for the Steiner Tree problem using the `generate_steiner_model` method.
5. **ILP Solution:** Solves the ILP problem using the `solve_steiner_instance` method.
6. **Solution Post-processing:** Post-processes the solution to remove self-loops and enforce a single parent for each node using the `post_process_steiner_solution` method.
7. **Tree Population:** Appends sample names to the solution, removes spurious leaves, and populates the `CassiopeiaTree` object with the resulting tree.
