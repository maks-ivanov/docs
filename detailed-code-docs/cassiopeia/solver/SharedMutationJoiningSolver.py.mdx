## High-level description
The `SharedMutationJoiningSolver` class implements an agglomerative clustering algorithm for phylogenetic tree reconstruction. It iteratively joins samples with the highest similarity based on shared mutations in their character data, building the tree bottom-up. This solver is particularly suitable for lineage tracing data with a large number of characters and limited mutation rates.

## Code Structure
The `SharedMutationJoiningSolver` class is structured around the `solve` method, which orchestrates the tree reconstruction process. It utilizes helper functions like `find_cherry` to identify the most similar samples and `update_similarity_map_and_character_matrix` to merge nodes and update the similarity matrix. The class also leverages Numba for performance optimization.

## References
This solver references the following key components:
- `dissimilarity_functions`: Provides various similarity/dissimilarity functions for comparing character vectors.
- `solver_utilities`: Offers utility functions for tree manipulation and prior transformation.
- `data_utilities`: Includes functions for computing dissimilarity maps and handling character data.

## Symbols
### `SharedMutationJoiningSolver`
#### Description
This class implements the Shared-Mutation-Joining algorithm for phylogenetic tree reconstruction. It takes a similarity function and a prior transformation method as inputs and constructs a tree by iteratively joining the most similar samples based on shared mutations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| similarity_function | Optional[Callable[[np.array, np.array, int, Optional[Dict[int, Dict[int, float]]]], float]] | Function to compute similarity between samples. Defaults to Hamming similarity without considering missing data. |
| prior_transformation | str | Method for transforming priors into weights. Defaults to "negative_log". |

#### Outputs
This class doesn't directly return any output. It modifies the input `CassiopeiaTree` object to store the reconstructed tree.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the solver with the provided similarity function and prior transformation method.
2. Attempts to optimize the similarity function and internal methods using Numba for performance improvement.
3. In the `solve` method:
    - Retrieves the character matrix and priors (if available) from the input `CassiopeiaTree`.
    - Computes the initial pairwise similarity matrix.
    - Iteratively identifies the most similar pair (cherry) using `find_cherry`.
    - Merges the cherry into a new internal node and updates the similarity matrix using `update_similarity_map_and_character_matrix`.
    - Repeats the process until all samples are joined into a single tree.
    - Populates the `CassiopeiaTree` with the reconstructed tree.
    - Optionally collapses mutationless edges based on inferred ancestral states.

#### Performance Considerations
- Utilizes Numba to optimize the similarity function and key internal methods for improved performance.
- Computes the dissimilarity map only once and updates it iteratively, reducing redundant calculations.

### `find_cherry`
#### Description
Identifies the pair of samples (cherry) with the highest similarity in the given similarity matrix.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| similarity_matrix | np.array | A square matrix representing pairwise similarities between samples. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cherry | Tuple[int, int] | A tuple containing the row and column indices of the most similar pair in the similarity matrix. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the diagonal elements of the similarity matrix to negative infinity to avoid self-comparison.
2. Finds the indices of the maximum element in the matrix, which represents the most similar pair.

### `update_similarity_map_and_character_matrix`
#### Description
Updates the similarity matrix and character matrix after merging a cherry into a new internal node.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| character_matrix | pd.DataFrame | The character matrix storing mutation information for all nodes. |
| similarity_function | Callable[[np.array, np.array, int, Dict[int, Dict[int, float]]], float] | The function used to compute pairwise similarity. |
| similarity_map | pd.DataFrame | The current similarity matrix to be updated. |
| cherry | Tuple[str, str] | A tuple containing the names of the two samples being merged. |
| new_node | str | The name of the new internal node created by merging the cherry. |
| missing_state_indicator | int | The character representing missing data in the character matrix. Defaults to -1. |
| weights | Optional[Dict[int, Dict[int, float]]] | Weights for each character/state pair, derived from priors. Defaults to None. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| updated_similarity_map | pd.DataFrame | The updated similarity matrix with the new internal node included. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Identifies the character vectors of the two samples in the cherry.
2. Computes the character vector of the new internal node (LCA) by taking shared mutations.
3. Adds the new node and its character vector to the character matrix.
4. Calculates the pairwise similarities between the new node and all other nodes using the provided similarity function and weights.
5. Updates the similarity matrix with the new similarities and removes the merged cherry nodes.

#### Performance Considerations
- Employs Numba to optimize the internal `__update_similarity_map` function for faster similarity updates.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| numba | Used for optimizing code performance. |
| numpy | Used for numerical operations and array manipulation. |
| pandas | Used for handling data in DataFrames. |
| scipy | Used for scientific computing, including distance calculations. |
| networkx | Used for creating and manipulating graph structures representing trees. |

## Error Handling
- Raises `SharedMutationJoiningSolverError` for specific issues encountered during tree reconstruction, such as invalid input parameters or inconsistencies in data.
- Issues a `SharedMutationJoiningSolverWarning` if Numba optimization fails, falling back to Python implementation.
