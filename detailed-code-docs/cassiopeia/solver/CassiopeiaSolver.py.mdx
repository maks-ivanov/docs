## High-level description
The `CassiopeiaSolver` is an abstract base class for all phylogenetic inference algorithms in the Cassiopeia framework. It defines the basic structure and interface for solvers, requiring subclasses to implement the `solve` method, which performs the actual tree inference. It also handles the transformation of prior probabilities into weights used by some solvers.

## Code Structure
The `CassiopeiaSolver` class is an abstract base class. It doesn't have any internal logic or complex interactions between symbols. The main purpose of this class is to define a common interface for all derived solver classes.

## Symbols

### `CassiopeiaSolver`
#### Description
This is an abstract base class for all phylogenetic inference algorithms. It defines the basic structure and interface for solvers.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| prior_transformation | str | A string specifying the function to use for transforming prior probabilities into weights. Defaults to "negative_log". |

#### Outputs
This class does not have any outputs.

#### Internal Logic
This class does not have any internal logic.

### `solve`
#### Description
This is an abstract method that needs to be implemented by all derived solver classes. It performs the actual tree inference.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cassiopeia_tree | CassiopeiaTree | A `CassiopeiaTree` object storing character information for phylogenetic inference. |
| layer | Optional[str] | Layer storing the character matrix for solving. If None, the default character matrix is used in the `CassiopeiaTree`. |
| collapse_mutationless_edges | bool | Indicates if the final reconstructed tree should collapse mutationless edges based on internal states inferred by Camin-Sokal parsimony. Defaults to False. |
| logfile | str | File location to log output. Defaults to "stdout.log". |

#### Outputs
This method does not have any outputs. It modifies the input `cassiopeia_tree` object by populating its tree attribute.

#### Internal Logic
This method is abstract and does not have any internal logic. It needs to be implemented by derived classes.
