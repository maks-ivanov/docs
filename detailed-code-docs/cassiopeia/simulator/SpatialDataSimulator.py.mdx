## High-level description
The `SpatialDataSimulator` class in `SpatialDataSimulator.py` defines an abstract base class for simulating spatial data on a `CassiopeiaTree`. It provides a blueprint for overlaying spatial coordinates onto the tree, mimicking the spatial organization of cells in a tissue. This abstract class is intended to be subclassed for specific spatial simulation models.

## Code Structure
This code defines a single abstract class `SpatialDataSimulator` which inherits from the `DataSimulator` class. The `SpatialDataSimulator` class doesn't directly interact with other symbols in the code, but it defines an abstract method `overlay_data` that needs to be implemented by its subclasses.

## References
This code references the following code symbols:

* `cassiopeia.data.CassiopeiaTree`
* `cassiopeia.simulator.DataSimulator.DataSimulator`

## Symbols
### `SpatialDataSimulator`
#### Description
This abstract class serves as a template for simulating spatial data on a `CassiopeiaTree`. It defines the structure for overlaying spatial coordinates onto the tree nodes, representing the spatial arrangement of cells. Subclasses of `SpatialDataSimulator` implement the `overlay_data` method to apply specific spatial models.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't have an `__init__` method and therefore doesn't take any direct inputs.

#### Outputs
This class doesn't directly return any outputs.

#### Internal Logic
This class doesn't have any internal logic as it's an abstract class.

## Side Effects
This class doesn't have any side effects as it's an abstract class.

## Dependencies
This code depends on the following external libraries:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| abc | Provides the abstract base class functionality. |

### `overlay_data`
#### Description
This abstract method defines the interface for overlaying spatial data onto a `CassiopeiaTree`. Subclasses must implement this method to apply specific spatial simulation models.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tree | CassiopeiaTree | The `CassiopeiaTree` object to overlay spatial data onto. |

#### Outputs
This method doesn't return any value, it modifies the `CassiopeiaTree` object in-place.

#### Internal Logic
This method is abstract and doesn't have an implementation in this class. Subclasses are responsible for providing the implementation based on the specific spatial model.
