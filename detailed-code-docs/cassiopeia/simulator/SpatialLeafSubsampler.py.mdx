## High-level description
The `SpatialLeafSubsampler` class is a subclass of `LeafSubsampler` that subsamples leaves within a specified region of interest in a `CassiopeiaTree` with spatial information. It supports subsampling using a bounding box or a numpy mask, and allows for downsampling by ratio or a fixed number of leaves.

## Code Structure
The `SpatialLeafSubsampler` class has a single method, `subsample_leaves`, which takes a `CassiopeiaTree` as input and returns a new `CassiopeiaTree` containing the subsampled leaves. The class constructor initializes the region of interest and downsampling parameters.

## References
- `CassiopeiaTree`: The `SpatialLeafSubsampler` operates on `CassiopeiaTree` objects.
- `LeafSubsampler`: The `SpatialLeafSubsampler` is a subclass of `LeafSubsampler`.

## Symbols

### `SpatialLeafSubsampler`
#### Description
This class subsamples leaves within a region of interest of a `CassiopeiaTree` with spatial information and produces a new `CassiopeiaTree` containing the sampled leaves.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| bounding_box | Optional[List[tuple]] | A list of tuples of the form (min, max) for each dimension of the bounding box. |
| space | Optional[np.ndarray] | Numpy array mask representing the space that cells will be sampled from. |
| ratio | Optional[float] | Specifies the number of leaves to be sampled as a ratio of the total number of leaves in the region of interest. |
| number_of_leaves | Optional[int] | Explicitly specifies the number of leaves to be sampled. |
| attribute_key | Optional[str] | The key in the CassiopeiaTree's node attributes that contains the spatial coordinates of the leaves. Defaults to "spatial". |
| merge_cells | Optional[bool] | Whether or not to merge cells contained within the same pixel in the space. Defaults to False. |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
The constructor checks for valid input parameters and stores them as instance variables.

### `subsample_leaves`
#### Description
This method subsamples the leaves of a `CassiopeiaTree` to those within a region of interest and returns a tree pruned to contain lineages relevant to only leaves in the sample (the "induced subtree" on the sample).

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tree | CassiopeiaTree | The `CassiopeiaTree` for which to subsample leaves. |
| keep_singular_root_edge | Optional[bool] | Whether or not to collapse the single edge leading from the root in the subsample, if it exists. Defaults to True. |
| collapse_duplicates | bool | Whether or not to collapse duplicated character states, so that only unique character states are present in each ambiguous state. Defaults to True. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| subsampled_tree | CassiopeiaTree | A new `CassiopeiaTree` that is the induced subtree on a sample of the leaves in the given tree. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for spatial information:** Ensures the tree has spatial information associated with the leaves.
2. **Subset leaves:**
    - If `bounding_box` is provided, keeps leaves within the specified bounding box.
    - If `space` is provided, keeps leaves within the specified mask.
3. **Determine number of leaves to sample:**
    - If `ratio` is provided, calculates the number of leaves to sample based on the ratio and the number of leaves in the region of interest.
    - If `number_of_leaves` is provided, uses the specified number.
    - If neither is provided, keeps all leaves in the region of interest.
4. **Sample leaves:** Randomly samples the specified number of leaves from the subset of leaves within the region of interest.
5. **Prune lineages:** Removes leaves not in the sample and prunes lineages no longer relevant to the sampled leaves.
6. **Merge cells (optional):** If `merge_cells` is True, merges cells within the same pixel in the space, creating a new cell with ambiguous character states.
7. **Collapse unifurcations:** Collapses unifurcations in the tree, preserving node times.
8. **Copy and annotate branch lengths and times:** Copies branch lengths and times from the original tree to the subsampled tree.

## Side Effects
The `subsample_leaves` method modifies the input `CassiopeiaTree` object in place if `copy` is set to False.

## Error Handling
The constructor and `subsample_leaves` method raise `LeafSubsamplerError` for invalid input parameters or if the tree does not have the required spatial information.

## Dependencies
- `numpy`: Used for array operations and random sampling.
- `pandas`: Used for character matrix manipulation.
- `networkx`: Used for tree manipulation.
- `collections`: Used for creating a defaultdict.
- `copy`: Used for deep copying the tree.
- `warnings`: Used for issuing warnings.

## Configuration
The `SpatialLeafSubsampler` class is configured using the parameters passed to its constructor.

## Logging
The code does not implement any specific logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The `SpatialLeafSubsampler` class exposes a single public method, `subsample_leaves`, which can be used to subsample the leaves of a `CassiopeiaTree` object.
