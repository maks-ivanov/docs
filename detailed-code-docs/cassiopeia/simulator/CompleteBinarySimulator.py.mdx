## High-level description
The `CompleteBinarySimulator` class simulates a complete binary tree, where each node has exactly two children except for the leaves. It provides a way to generate a balanced tree topology with specified depth or number of cells, which can be used for in silico simulations of single-cell phylogenies.

## Code Structure
The `CompleteBinarySimulator` class inherits from the `TreeSimulator` abstract class and implements the `simulate_tree` method. It uses the `networkx` library to generate a balanced binary tree and then converts it into a `CassiopeiaTree` object.

## References
This code references the following symbols:
- `TreeSimulator`: The abstract base class for tree simulators.
- `CassiopeiaTree`: The data structure representing a tree in Cassiopeia.
- `TreeSimulatorError`: An exception class for tree simulator errors.
- `nx.balanced_tree`: A function from the `networkx` library to generate a balanced binary tree.

## Symbols

### `CompleteBinarySimulator`
#### Description
This class simulates a complete binary tree with a specified depth or number of cells. It uses the `networkx` library to generate a balanced binary tree and then converts it into a `CassiopeiaTree` object. The branch lengths are normalized by the height of the tree, resulting in a tree with a height of 1.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| num_cells | Optional[int] | Number of cells to simulate (must be a power of 2). |
| depth | Optional[int] | Depth of the tree. |

#### Outputs
This class doesn't directly return any output. It simulates a tree and stores it internally.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Initialization:**
    - Checks if exactly one of `num_cells` or `depth` is provided.
    - If `num_cells` is provided, calculates the `depth` and validates that `num_cells` is a power of 2.
    - If `depth` is provided, validates that it is greater than 0.
2. **Tree Simulation (`simulate_tree` method):**
    - Generates a balanced binary tree using `nx.balanced_tree` with a branching factor of 2.
    - Creates a mapping from the default integer node names to unique string names.
    - Adds a root node ("root") and connects it to the root of the generated binary tree.
    - Relabels the nodes using the generated mapping.
    - Creates a `CassiopeiaTree` object from the generated tree.
    - Initializes branch lengths by dividing the time of each node by the total depth of the tree plus 1.

#### Side Effects
- Creates and stores a `CassiopeiaTree` object internally.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| networkx | Used to generate the balanced binary tree. |
| numpy | Used for logarithmic calculations. |
| cassiopeia.data.CassiopeiaTree | Used to create the `CassiopeiaTree` object. |
| cassiopeia.mixins | Used to raise `TreeSimulatorError` in case of invalid input. |
| cassiopeia.simulator.TreeSimulator | The abstract base class for tree simulators. |

## Error Handling
- Raises `TreeSimulatorError` if:
    - Neither or both `num_cells` and `depth` are provided.
    - `num_cells` is not a power of 2.
    - `depth` is not greater than 0.
