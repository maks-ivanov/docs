## High-level description
The `TreeSimulator` class is an abstract base class for all tree simulators in Cassiopeia. It defines the basic interface for simulating single-cell phylogenies, requiring derived classes to implement a `simulate_tree` method that returns a `CassiopeiaTree` object representing the simulated phylogeny. This enables users to generate ground truth phylogenies for evaluating different reconstruction and analysis methods.

## References
This class is referenced in other parts of the codebase, particularly in concrete simulator implementations like `BirthDeathFitnessSimulator`, `CompleteBinarySimulator`, and `SimpleFitSubcloneSimulator`. These classes inherit from `TreeSimulator` and provide specific simulation algorithms.

## Symbols
### `TreeSimulator`
#### Description
This is an abstract base class for all tree simulators. It defines the blueprint for simulating single-cell phylogenies.

#### Inputs
This class does not have an __init__ method and therefore does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This class does not directly return any outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The class uses the `abc` module to define the `simulate_tree` method as an abstract method, ensuring that all concrete subclasses must implement this method.

### `simulate_tree`
#### Description
An abstract method that needs to be implemented by all derived classes. This method should simulate a `CassiopeiaTree` with at least its tree topology initialized.

#### Inputs
This method does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
|  | `CassiopeiaTree` | A `CassiopeiaTree` object representing the simulated phylogeny. The tree should have at least its topology initialized. |

#### Internal Logic
This method is abstract and therefore does not have any internal logic defined in the base class. Concrete subclasses are responsible for implementing the specific simulation logic.
