## High-level description

The `TreeSimulator` class in the `TreeSimulator.py` file is an abstract base class designed for simulating phylogenetic trees. It provides a framework for creating various tree simulation models, which are used to generate in silico single-cell phylogenies. These simulations can be used to evaluate methods for reconstructing and analyzing phylogenetic trees. The class requires derived classes to implement the `simulate_tree` method, which returns a `CassiopeiaTree` object with at least its topology initialized.

## Code Structure

- **TreeSimulator**: This is the main abstract class in the file. It serves as a base class for all tree simulators and mandates the implementation of the `simulate_tree` method in derived classes.
- **CassiopeiaTree**: This is a referenced class from the `cassiopeia.data` module, which represents the tree structure that the simulators will generate.
- **TreeSimulatorError**: This is a custom exception class from the `cassiopeia.mixins` module, used for handling errors specific to tree simulation.

## References

- **CassiopeiaTree**: The `simulate_tree` method is expected to return an instance of this class, which is defined in the `cassiopeia.data.CassiopeiaTree` module.
- **TreeSimulatorError**: This is used for error handling and is defined in the `cassiopeia.mixins.errors` module.

## Symbols

### `TreeSimulator`
#### Description
The `TreeSimulator` class is an abstract base class for simulating phylogenetic trees. It provides a structure for creating tree simulators that return a `CassiopeiaTree` with its topology initialized. The class is designed to be extended by specific tree simulation implementations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | None | The class itself does not take inputs directly but serves as a base for other classes. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| simulate_tree | CassiopeiaTree | A method that must be implemented by subclasses to return a simulated tree. |

#### Internal Logic
The `TreeSimulator` class uses Python's `abc` module to define an abstract method `simulate_tree`. This method must be implemented by any subclass, ensuring that all tree simulators provide a way to generate a `CassiopeiaTree`.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `abc` | Used to define the abstract base class and abstract methods. |
| `cassiopeia.data.CassiopeiaTree` | Represents the tree structure that simulators will generate. |
| `cassiopeia.mixins.TreeSimulatorError` | Custom exception for handling errors specific to tree simulation. |

## Error Handling

The `TreeSimulator` class itself does not implement error handling, but it references `TreeSimulatorError` for use in derived classes. This allows specific tree simulators to raise meaningful exceptions related to tree simulation errors.

## Logging

The `TreeSimulator` class does not implement any logging mechanisms. Logging, if needed, would be implemented in the derived classes that extend this abstract base class.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
