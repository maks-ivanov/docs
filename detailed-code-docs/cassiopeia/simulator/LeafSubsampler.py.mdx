## High-level description
The `LeafSubsampler` class in `LeafSubsampler.py` defines an abstract base class for all leaf samplers in the Cassiopeia library. It provides a blueprint for creating derived classes that implement different methods for subsampling the leaves of a CassiopeiaTree. 

Leaf subsampling is a common operation in phylogenetic analysis, where a subset of leaves (representing cells or taxa) is selected from a larger tree to perform downstream analyses. This can be useful for reducing computational complexity, focusing on specific lineages, or simulating different sampling scenarios.

## Code Structure
This code defines an abstract base class `LeafSubsampler` with one abstract method `subsample_leaves`. This method is meant to be implemented by concrete leaf subsampler classes that inherit from this base class.

## References
This code references the following symbols from other files:

* `cassiopeia.data.CassiopeiaTree`: This class represents a phylogenetic tree with associated data, such as character states and metadata.
* `cassiopeia.mixins.LeafSubsamplerError`: This exception class is raised for errors specific to leaf subsampling operations.
* `cassiopeia.mixins.LeafSubsamplerWarning`: This warning class is used to issue warnings related to leaf subsampling.
* `abc.ABC` and `abc.abstractmethod`: These are used to define abstract base classes and methods, ensuring that derived classes implement the required functionality.

## Symbols

### `LeafSubsampler`
#### Description
This is an abstract base class for all leaf samplers. It defines the interface that concrete leaf sampler classes must implement.

#### Inputs
This class does not have an `__init__` method and therefore does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This class does not directly return any outputs.

#### Internal Logic
This class does not have any internal logic as it is an abstract base class.

## Side Effects
This class does not have any side effects as it is an abstract base class.
