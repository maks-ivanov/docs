## High-level description

The `cassiopeia/simulator` directory is a comprehensive module within the Cassiopeia library designed for simulating phylogenetic trees and overlaying various types of data onto these trees. It includes a variety of simulators that model different biological processes, such as birth-death processes, spatial data generation, and lineage tracing using Cas9 technology. The simulators can be used to generate in silico single-cell phylogenies, which are valuable for evaluating methods for reconstructing and analyzing phylogenetic trees. The directory also includes tools for subsampling leaves from trees based on different criteria, such as spatial information or uniform sampling.

## What does it do?

The simulators in this directory are used to create phylogenetic trees and simulate data that can be overlaid onto these trees. This process involves several steps:

1. **Tree Simulation**: Various simulators generate phylogenetic trees using different models. For example, the `BirthDeathFitnessSimulator` uses a birth-death process with fitness considerations, while the `CompleteBinarySimulator` generates perfectly balanced binary trees.

2. **Data Overlay**: Once a tree is generated, data can be overlaid onto it. This includes spatial data, lineage tracing data, and other types of biological data. For instance, the `BrownianSpatialDataSimulator` overlays spatial coordinates onto a tree using a Brownian motion model, while the `Cas9LineageTracingDataSimulator` simulates mutations and silencing events in a Cas9-based lineage tracing experiment.

3. **Subsampling**: The directory also provides tools for subsampling leaves from a tree. This can be done uniformly, based on spatial criteria, or by merging leaves to create ambiguous character states. The `UniformLeafSubsampler` and `SpatialLeafSubsampler` are examples of classes that perform these tasks.

4. **Specialized Simulations**: Some simulators are designed for specific biological scenarios, such as the `ecDNABirthDeathSimulator`, which models populations with extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA), incorporating dynamics like copy number variations and cosegregation during cell division.

Overall, the simulators in this directory provide a flexible and powerful framework for generating and analyzing phylogenetic trees and the data associated with them, enabling researchers to study evolutionary dynamics and the effects of various parameters on phylogenetic reconstruction.
