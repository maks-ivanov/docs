## High-level description
This file serves as the top-level module for the `cassiopeia.simulator` package, exposing various tree and data simulators for generating synthetic lineage tracing data. It imports and re-exports specific simulator classes, making them readily available for use in other parts of the codebase.

## Code Structure
This file simply imports classes from submodules within the `cassiopeia.simulator` package and defines a list `__all__` to specify which symbols should be exported when using `from cassiopeia.simulator import *`.

## Symbols
### `__all__`
#### Description
A list of strings representing the names of the simulator classes to be exported when using `from cassiopeia.simulator import *`.

#### Internal Logic
The list includes the names of various tree and data simulators, such as `BirthDeathFitnessSimulator`, `BrownianSpatialDataSimulator`, `Cas9LineageTracingDataSimulator`, etc. These classes are responsible for generating synthetic lineage tracing data with different characteristics and underlying models.
