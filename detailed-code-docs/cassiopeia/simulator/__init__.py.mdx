## High-level description

The `cassiopeia/simulator/__init__.py` file serves as the top-level module for the simulator package within the Cassiopeia library. It imports various simulator classes and functions from different modules within the package, making them accessible when the simulator package is imported. This file essentially acts as an aggregator for the different simulation components, allowing users to easily access and utilize them for simulating phylogenetic trees and lineage tracing data.

## Code Structure

The file imports several classes and functions from other modules within the `cassiopeia.simulator` package. These imports are then included in the `__all__` list, which defines the public API of the module. This means that when the module is imported, only the symbols listed in `__all__` are accessible.

## Symbols

### `__all__`
#### Description
The `__all__` list defines the public API of the module. It specifies which classes and functions are accessible when the module is imported. This is a common practice in Python to control the namespace of a module.

#### Contents
The `__all__` list includes the following symbols:
- `BirthDeathFitnessSimulator`
- `BrownianSpatialDataSimulator`
- `Cas9LineageTracingDataSimulator`
- `SequentialLineageTracingDataSimulator`
- `CompleteBinarySimulator`
- `DataSimulator`
- `ecDNABirthDeathSimulator`
- `LeafSubsampler`
- `LineageTracingDataSimulator`
- `SimpleFitSubcloneSimulator`
- `SupercellularSampler`
- `TreeSimulator`
- `UniformLeafSubsampler`

These symbols correspond to various simulator classes and functions that are part of the Cassiopeia simulator package.

## References

The file references several classes and functions from other modules within the `cassiopeia.simulator` package. These references are crucial for understanding the functionality provided by the simulator package. Each imported class or function represents a specific type of simulator or utility related to phylogenetic tree simulation or data overlay.

## Dependencies

The file does not directly list external dependencies, but the imported modules may have their own dependencies. For instance, the simulators might rely on libraries like `networkx` for graph operations or `numpy` for numerical computations.

## Conclusion

The `cassiopeia/simulator/__init__.py` file is a straightforward module that aggregates various simulator classes and functions from the Cassiopeia library. It defines the public API for the simulator package, making it easier for users to access and utilize the different simulation components for phylogenetic tree and lineage tracing data simulations.
