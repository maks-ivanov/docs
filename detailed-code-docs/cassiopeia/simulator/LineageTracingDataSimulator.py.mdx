## High-level description

The `LineageTracingDataSimulator.py` file defines an abstract class `LineageTracingDataSimulator`, which is a subclass of `DataSimulator`. This class is designed to simulate lineage tracing data by overlaying it onto a `CassiopeiaTree`. The primary purpose of this class is to provide a framework for simulating lineage tracing assays, allowing researchers to study the effects of various parameters on the reconstruction of cell phylogenies.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in this file is the `LineageTracingDataSimulator` class, which inherits from the `DataSimulator` class. It is an abstract class, meaning it is intended to be subclassed by other classes that implement specific types of lineage tracing data simulations. The `overlay_data` method is defined as an abstract method, which must be implemented by any subclass.

## References

- `CassiopeiaTree`: This is a data structure from the `cassiopeia.data` module that represents a phylogenetic tree with character states and other metadata. It is the primary data structure onto which lineage tracing data is overlaid.
- `DataSimulator`: This is the parent abstract class from which `LineageTracingDataSimulator` inherits. It provides a generic interface for overlaying data onto a `CassiopeiaTree`.

## Symbols

### `LineageTracingDataSimulator`
#### Description
The `LineageTracingDataSimulator` is an abstract class that serves as a base for simulating lineage tracing data. It is designed to overlay lineage tracing data onto a `CassiopeiaTree`, setting the character states of the tree nodes and the character matrix. This class is useful for simulating in silico lineage tracing assays, which can help in understanding the impact of various parameters on phylogenetic reconstruction.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tree | `CassiopeiaTree` | The tree onto which lineage tracing data is overlaid. The tree must have its topology initialized. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | None | The method modifies the `CassiopeiaTree` in place. |

#### Internal Logic
The `overlay_data` method is abstract and must be implemented by subclasses. It is intended to modify the `CassiopeiaTree` by setting the character states of all nodes and updating the character matrix based on the simulated lineage tracing data.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `abc` | Used to define the abstract base class and abstract methods. |
| `CassiopeiaTree` | Represents the tree structure onto which data is overlaid. |
| `DataSimulator` | The parent class providing a generic interface for data simulation. |

## Error Handling

The `overlay_data` method is abstract and does not implement any error handling itself. Subclasses are expected to handle any errors that may arise during the data overlay process.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in this file. Subclasses may implement logging as needed to track the simulation process.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
