## High-level description
The `LineageTracingDataSimulator` class in `LineageTracingDataSimulator.py` is an abstract base class for simulating lineage tracing data on a `CassiopeiaTree`. It provides a framework for overlaying lineage tracing data onto a tree structure, enabling the exploration of different lineage tracing technologies and their impact on reconstructing cell phylogenies.

## Code Structure
The `LineageTracingDataSimulator` class inherits from the abstract base class `DataSimulator` and defines a single abstract method, `overlay_data`. This method is intended to be implemented by concrete subclasses to perform the actual data overlay based on the specific lineage tracing technology being simulated.

## References
This code references the following symbols:

- `cassiopeia.data.CassiopeiaTree`
- `cassiopeia.simulator.DataSimulator.DataSimulator`

## Symbols

### `LineageTracingDataSimulator`
#### Description
This is an abstract class that serves as a base for all lineage tracing data simulators. It defines the common interface for simulating lineage tracing data on a `CassiopeiaTree`.

#### Inputs
This class does not have its own constructor and therefore does not accept any direct inputs.

#### Outputs
This class is an abstract class and does not directly produce outputs.

#### Internal Logic
This class does not have any internal logic as it is an abstract class.

## Side Effects
This class does not have any side effects as it is an abstract class.

#### Performance Considerations
This class does not have any performance considerations as it is an abstract class.
