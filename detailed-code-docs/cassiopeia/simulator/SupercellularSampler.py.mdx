## High-level description
The `SupercellularSampler` class is a subclass of `LeafSubsampler` that simulates the merging of cells in a lineage tree, creating "supercellular" states. This is achieved by iteratively merging pairs of leaves, chosen with probability inversely proportional to their branch distance, resulting in a tree with ambiguous character states.

## Code Structure
The `SupercellularSampler` class has a single public method, `subsample_leaves`, which takes a `CassiopeiaTree` as input and returns a new `CassiopeiaTree` with merged leaves. The merging process is controlled by either the `ratio` or `number_of_merges` parameter passed to the constructor.

## References
This class references the following code symbols:
- `CassiopeiaTree`
- `LeafSubsampler`
- `LeafSubsamplerError`

## Symbols
### SupercellularSampler
#### Description
This class implements a leaf subsampling strategy where leaves are merged iteratively to create a tree with ambiguous character states, simulating the merging of cells.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ratio | Optional[float] | The number of times to merge as a ratio of the total number of leaves. |
| number_of_merges | Optional[float] | Explicit number of merges to perform. |

#### Outputs
This class does not directly return any output. It modifies the input `CassiopeiaTree` object.

#### Internal Logic
The `subsample_leaves` method performs the following steps:
1. **Determine the number of merges:** Based on the provided `ratio` or `number_of_merges`, the number of merge operations is calculated.
2. **Iterative merging:** For each merge operation:
    - Randomly select a leaf node (`leaf1`).
    - Calculate the branch distances from `leaf1` to all other leaves.
    - Randomly select a second leaf node (`leaf2`) with probability inversely proportional to its distance from `leaf1`.
    - Merge `leaf1` and `leaf2` into a new leaf node with a combined name and ambiguous character states.
    - Connect the new leaf node to the LCA of the original leaves.
    - Set the time of the new leaf node to the mean time of the original leaves.
3. **Tree cleanup:**
    - Collapse unifurcations in the tree.
    - Optionally collapse duplicated character states in ambiguous nodes.
4. **Return the modified tree:** The modified `CassiopeiaTree` object is returned.

## Side Effects
The `subsample_leaves` method modifies the input `CassiopeiaTree` object in-place.

## Error Handling
The class raises `LeafSubsamplerError` if:
- Both `ratio` and `number_of_merges` are not specified or both are specified.
- The number of merges exceeds the number of leaves in the tree.
- No merges are to be performed.
- The tree does not have a character matrix defined.

## Dependencies
This class depends on the following external libraries:
