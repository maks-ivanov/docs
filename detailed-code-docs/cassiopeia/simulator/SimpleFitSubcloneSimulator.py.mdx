## High-level description
The `SimpleFitSubcloneSimulator` class simulates the growth of a clonal population where a single subclone develops a fitness advantage after a specified number of generations. This simulator is useful for generating both deterministic and stochastic phylogenies that exhibit non-neutral evolution due to the presence of a fitter subclone.

## Code Structure
The `SimpleFitSubcloneSimulator` class inherits from the `TreeSimulator` class. It overrides the `simulate_tree` method to implement its specific simulation logic. The class uses a queue to manage the growth of the tree, adding new nodes and edges based on the specified branch lengths and the time of the experiment.

## References
This code references the following symbols:
- `cassiopeia.data.CassiopeiaTree`
- `cassiopeia.simulator.TreeSimulator`

## Symbols
### `SimpleFitSubcloneSimulator`
#### Description
This class simulates a clonal population with a single fit subclone emerging after a specified number of generations. It allows for both deterministic and stochastic simulations by accepting either constant values or callables for branch lengths.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| branch_length_neutral | Union[float, Callable[[], float]] | Branch length of neutrally evolving individuals. Can be a constant or a callable returning a float. |
| branch_length_fit | Union[float, Callable[[], float]] | Branch length of the fit subclone. Can be a constant or a callable returning a float. |
| experiment_duration | float | Total duration of the simulation. |
| generations_until_fit_subclone | int | Generation at which the fit subclone emerges. |

#### Outputs
This class doesn't directly return any output. It simulates a tree and stores it internally.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the branch length callables for neutral and fit individuals.
2. Creates a directed graph to represent the tree.
3. Initializes a queue to manage the growth of the tree, starting with the root node.
4. Iteratively processes nodes from the queue:
    - Determines the time until the next division based on the node's fitness.
    - If the time exceeds the experiment duration, the node becomes a leaf.
    - Otherwise, creates two children nodes, assigns their fitness based on the current generation and the `generations_until_fit_subclone` parameter, and adds them to the queue.
5. Constructs a `CassiopeiaTree` object from the simulated tree graph and returns it.

## Side Effects
The `simulate_tree` method modifies the internal state of the `SimpleFitSubcloneSimulator` object by creating and populating the tree graph.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| networkx | Used for creating and manipulating the tree graph. |
| queue | Used for managing the growth of the tree. |
| typing | Used for type hinting. |
| cassiopeia.data | Used for the `CassiopeiaTree` class. |
| cassiopeia.simulator | Used for the `TreeSimulator` class. |

```python
class SimpleFitSubcloneSimulator(TreeSimulator):
    ...
```

### `_create_callable`
#### Description
This private method converts a constant branch length value or a callable into a callable. This allows the simulator to handle both deterministic and stochastic branch lengths.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| x | Union[float, Callable[[], float]] | Branch length value or callable. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| constant_branch_length_callable or x | Callable[[], float] | A callable that returns the branch length. |

#### Internal Logic
1. If `x` is an integer or float, it defines a new callable that always returns `x`.
2. Otherwise, it returns `x` directly, assuming it's already a callable.

```python
    def _create_callable(
        self, x: Union[float, Callable[[], float]]
    ) -&gt; Callable[[], float]:
        # In case the user provides an int, we still hold their back...
        if type(x) in [int, float]:

            def constant_branch_length_callable() -&gt; float:
                return x

            return constant_branch_length_callable
        else:
            return x
```

### `simulate_tree`
#### Description
This method simulates the growth of a clonal population with a single fit subclone and returns the resulting tree as a `CassiopeiaTree` object.

#### Inputs
This method doesn't take any explicit inputs. It uses the parameters provided during the initialization of the `SimpleFitSubcloneSimulator` object.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| res | CassiopeiaTree | The simulated tree. |

#### Internal Logic
Refer to the "Internal Logic" section of the `SimpleFitSubcloneSimulator` class description for details on the simulation process.

```python
    def simulate_tree(self) -&gt; CassiopeiaTree:
        ...
```
