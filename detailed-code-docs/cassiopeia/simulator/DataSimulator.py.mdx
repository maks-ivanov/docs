## High-level description
The `DataSimulator` class in `cassiopeia/simulator/DataSimulator.py` is an abstract base class for simulating various types of data to overlay onto a `CassiopeiaTree`. This class provides a blueprint for creating simulators that can generate data like lineage tracing information, transcriptomes, or proteomes, allowing for in silico exploration of different data types and their impact on phylogenetic reconstruction.

## Code Structure
This code defines a single abstract class `DataSimulator` which serves as a template for concrete data simulator implementations. It doesn't have complex interconnections between symbols.

## Symbols
### Symbol Name: `DataSimulator`
#### Description
This abstract class defines the blueprint for all data simulators. It mandates that any derived class must implement the `overlay_data` method.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't take any input during initialization.

#### Outputs
This class doesn't return any output during initialization.

#### Internal Logic
This class doesn't have any internal logic as it's an abstract class.

### Symbol Name: `overlay_data`
#### Description
This abstract method defines the core functionality of a `DataSimulator`. It's intended to be implemented by derived classes to overlay specific types of data onto a `CassiopeiaTree`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tree | CassiopeiaTree | The `CassiopeiaTree` object to overlay the simulated data on. The tree is assumed to have its topology initialized. |

#### Outputs
This method doesn't return any value. It modifies the input `CassiopeiaTree` in-place.

#### Internal Logic
This method is abstract and doesn't have an implementation in this base class. Derived classes are responsible for implementing the specific logic for data overlay.
