## High-level description

The `DataSimulator` class in the `cassiopeia/simulator/DataSimulator.py` file is an abstract base class designed for overlaying data onto a `CassiopeiaTree`. It provides a flexible API for users to implement various types of data simulations, such as lineage tracing or spatial data, by extending this class and implementing the `overlay_data` method. This method is intended to modify the `CassiopeiaTree` in place by overlaying the desired data.

## Code Structure

The `DataSimulator` class is an abstract class that serves as a base for other data simulator classes. It requires derived classes to implement the `overlay_data` method, which is responsible for overlaying specific types of data onto a `CassiopeiaTree`.

## References

- `CassiopeiaTree`: This is a class from the `cassiopeia.data` module that represents the tree structure onto which data is overlaid.
- `DataSimulatorError`: This is an exception class from the `cassiopeia.mixins` module used to handle errors specific to data simulators.

## Symbols

### `DataSimulator`
#### Description
The `DataSimulator` class is an abstract base class for creating data simulators that overlay data onto a `CassiopeiaTree`. It provides a framework for implementing specific data overlay methods by requiring subclasses to define the `overlay_data` method.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tree | `CassiopeiaTree` | The tree structure onto which data will be overlaid. The tree topology must be initialized before overlaying data. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | None | The method modifies the `CassiopeiaTree` in place. |

#### Internal Logic
The `DataSimulator` class itself does not implement any internal logic for data overlaying. It serves as a template for derived classes, which must implement the `overlay_data` method to perform specific data overlay operations.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `abc` | Used to define the `DataSimulator` as an abstract base class. |
| `CassiopeiaTree` | Represents the tree structure onto which data is overlaid. |
| `DataSimulatorError` | Used for handling errors specific to data simulators. |

## Error Handling

The `DataSimulator` class references `DataSimulatorError` for handling errors specific to data simulators. However, since this is an abstract class, the actual error handling would be implemented in the derived classes.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or additional notes in the code.
