Here's a documentation for the target file `cassiopeia/data/__init__.py`:

## High-level description
This file serves as the top-level initialization for the `cassiopeia.data` module. It imports and exposes key classes and utility functions from the module, making them easily accessible to users of the Cassiopeia package.

## Symbols

### `CassiopeiaTree`
#### Description
Imports the `CassiopeiaTree` class from the `CassiopeiaTree` module. This class is the core data structure in Cassiopeia, representing a phylogenetic tree with associated character matrices and metadata.

### Utility Functions
#### Description
Imports several utility functions from the `utilities` module. These functions provide various operations and computations related to phylogenetic trees and character matrices.

#### Imported Functions:
1. `compute_dissimilarity_map`: Computes pairwise dissimilarities between samples in a character matrix.
2. `compute_inter_cluster_distances`: Calculates mean distances between categories in a categorical variable.
3. `compute_phylogenetic_weight_matrix`: Computes distances or proximities between all leaves in a tree.
4. `get_lca_characters`: Builds the character vector of the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of a list of character vectors.
5. `net_relatedness_index`: Computes the net relatedness index between two groups of indices.
6. `sample_bootstrap_allele_tables`: Generates bootstrap character matrices from an allele table.
7. `sample_bootstrap_character_matrices`: Creates bootstrapped character matrices from a given character matrix.
8. `to_newick`: Converts a networkx graph to a Newick string representation.

Note: This file acts as a convenient entry point for users of the Cassiopeia package, allowing them to import commonly used classes and functions directly from `cassiopeia.data` without needing to know the exact submodule structure.
