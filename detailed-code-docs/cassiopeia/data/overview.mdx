## High-level description

The `cassiopeia/data` directory contains core data structures and utility functions for working with phylogenetic trees, character matrices, and genetic data in the Cassiopeia package. It includes the `CassiopeiaTree` class, which is the central data structure for representing phylogenetic trees with associated character matrices and metadata. The directory also provides a collection of utility functions for various operations on genetic data and tree structures.

## What does it do?

This directory implements the following key functionalities:

1. Represents phylogenetic trees with associated mutation data using the `CassiopeiaTree` class.
2. Manages multiple versions of mutation data for cells in a tree using the `Layers` class.
3. Provides utility functions for:
   - Computing dissimilarity maps between samples
   - Calculating distances between categories in categorical variables
   - Computing phylogenetic weight matrices
   - Performing bootstrap sampling of character matrices and allele tables
   - Converting between different data formats (e.g., allele tables to character matrices)
   - Manipulating and analyzing tree structures
   - Computing various indices and metrics for genetic data analysis

These functionalities support various aspects of lineage tracing and phylogenetic analysis in the Cassiopeia package.

## Key Files

1. `CassiopeiaTree.py`: Implements the `CassiopeiaTree` class, which is the core data structure for representing phylogenetic trees with associated character matrices and metadata.

2. `Layers.py`: Contains the `Layers` class, which manages multiple versions of mutation data for cells in a `CassiopeiaTree` object.

3. `utilities.py`: Provides a collection of utility functions for various operations on genetic data and tree structures, including bootstrapping, data conversion, dissimilarity computations, and tree manipulations.

4. `__init__.py`: Serves as the entry point for the `cassiopeia.data` module, importing and exposing key classes and utility functions for easy access.

## Dependencies

The `cassiopeia/data` directory relies on several external libraries:

1. numpy: For numerical computations and array operations
2. pandas: For data manipulation and storage in DataFrame format
3. networkx: For graph operations and tree representations
4. scipy: For various scientific computing functions
5. ete3: For working with phylogenetic trees

These dependencies are used throughout the module to support efficient data processing and analysis tasks related to phylogenetic trees and genetic data.

## Configuration

The `cassiopeia/data` directory does not appear to have specific configuration files or environment variables. However, some functions in the `utilities.py` file accept optional parameters that can be used to configure their behavior, such as:

- `random_state` for reproducibility in bootstrapping functions
- Various filtering and processing parameters in data conversion functions

Users can adjust these parameters as needed when calling the utility functions to customize their behavior for specific analysis requirements.

In summary, the `cassiopeia/data` directory provides the core data structures and utility functions necessary for working with phylogenetic trees and genetic data in the Cassiopeia package. It offers a flexible and powerful set of tools for researchers and developers working on lineage tracing and phylogenetic analysis projects.
