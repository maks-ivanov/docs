## High-level description
This file contains functions for preprocessing sequencing data into a character matrix, which is suitable for phylogenetic inference. It provides a series of functions that perform various steps of the preprocessing pipeline, including converting FASTQ files to BAM, filtering reads, collapsing UMIs, aligning sequences, calling alleles, error correcting barcodes and UMIs, filtering molecule tables, and calling lineage groups.

## Code Structure
The code defines several functions that are used sequentially in a preprocessing pipeline. The functions are designed to be modular and can be invoked individually or as part of a larger pipeline. The main functions include `convert_fastqs_to_unmapped_bam`, `filter_bam`, `error_correct_cellbcs_to_whitelist`, `collapse_umis`, `resolve_umi_sequence`, `align_sequences`, `call_alleles`, `error_correct_intbcs_to_whitelist`, `error_correct_umis`, `filter_molecule_table`, and `call_lineage_groups`. Each function performs a specific step in the preprocessing pipeline and takes a DataFrame or a file path as input and returns a processed DataFrame or a file path.

## References
This file references constants defined in `cassiopeia.preprocess.constants`, utility functions from `cassiopeia.preprocess.utilities`, and alignment utilities from `cassiopeia.preprocess.alignment_utilities`. It also uses functions from external libraries such as `ngs_tools`, `pysam`, and `pandas`.

| fastq_fps | List[str] | List of paths to FASTQ files. |
| chemistry | Literal["dropseq", "10xv2", "10xv3", "indropsv3", "slideseq2"] | Sample-prep/sequencing chemistry used. |
| output_directory | str | The output directory where the unmapped BAM will be written. |
| name | Optional[str] | Name of the reads in the FASTQs. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|

#### Internal Logic
The function first checks if the provided chemistry is supported. It then retrieves the appropriate BAM tags for the chemistry and converts the FASTQ files to an unmapped BAM file using the `ngs.fastq.fastqs_to_bam_with_chemistry` function from the `ngs_tools` library.

### `filter_bam`
#### Description
Filters reads in a BAM file that have low quality barcode or UMIs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|

| output_directory | str | The output directory where the filtered BAM will be written. |
| quality_threshold | int | Every base of the barcode and UMI sequence for a given read must have at least this PHRED quality score to pass filtering. Defaults to 10. |
| n_threads | int | Number of threads to use. Defaults to 1. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filtered_fp | str | Path to the filtered BAM file. |

#### Internal Logic
The function defines a filter function that checks the quality scores of the barcode and UMI sequences. It then uses the `ngs.bam.filter_bam` function from the `ngs_tools` library to filter the input BAM file based on the filter function.

### `error_correct_cellbcs_to_whitelist`
#### Description
Error-corrects cell barcodes in the input BAM file to a provided whitelist.

#### Inputs

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |

#### Internal Logic
The function first reads the whitelist from the provided file or list. It then extracts the raw barcodes and their qualities from the input BAM file. It uses the `ngs.sequence.correct_sequences_to_whitelist` function from the `ngs_tools` library to correct the barcodes to the whitelist. Finally, it writes the corrected barcodes to a new BAM file.

#### Internal Logic
The function first groups the molecule table by cell barcode and UMI. For each group, it selects the most abundant sequence as the consensus sequence and marks the remaining sequences for filtering. It then filters out the marked sequences and applies cell filtering based on the minimum number of UMIs per cell and the minimum average reads per UMI.
