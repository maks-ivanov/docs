## High-level description
This file defines the public API for the `cassiopeia.preprocess` module, exposing functions for preprocessing sequencing data into character matrices suitable for phylogenetic inference. It imports and re-exports specific functions from submodules, making them directly accessible through `cassiopeia.preprocess`.

## References
This file imports and re-exports symbols from the following files:
 - `cassiopeia/preprocess/pipeline.py`
 - `cassiopeia/preprocess/utilities.py`
 - `cassiopeia/preprocess/setup_utilities.py`

## Symbols
### Symbol Name
#### `__all__`
#### Description
A list of strings defining the public API of the `cassiopeia.preprocess` module. It specifies which symbols are exported when using `from cassiopeia.preprocess import *`.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a variable, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a variable, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The list includes functions for various preprocessing steps like sequence alignment, allele calling, UMI collapsing, data filtering, and lineage group calling. It also includes utility functions for data conversion and setup.
```python
__all__ = [
    "align_sequences",
    "call_alleles",
    "collapse_umis",
    "convert_fastqs_to_unmapped_bam",
    "error_correct_cellbcs_to_whitelist",
    "error_correct_intbcs_to_whitelist",
    "error_correct_umis",
    "filter_bam",
    "resolve_umi_sequence",
    "filter_molecule_table",
    "call_lineage_groups",
    "compute_empirical_indel_priors",
    "convert_alleletable_to_character_matrix",
    "convert_alleletable_to_lineage_profile",
    "convert_lineage_profile_to_character_matrix",
    "filter_cells",
    "filter_umis",
    "setup",
]
```
