## High-level description
This code defines a function `map_intbcs` that processes a molecule table to resolve allele ambiguity for each cellBC/intBC pair. It identifies the most frequent allele based on read count and UMI count, then filters out alignments with other alleles for each pair.

## Symbols
### `map_intbcs`
#### Description
This function takes a molecule table as input and returns a modified allele table where each cellBC/intBC pair is associated with a single allele. It achieves this by grouping the input table by cellBC, intBC, and allele, then selecting the allele with the highest read count (and UMI count as a tie-breaker) for each group. Alignments with other alleles for the same cellBC/intBC pair are removed.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| molecule_table | pandas.DataFrame | A molecule table containing cellBC, intBC, allele, readCount, and UMI information. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mapped_table | pandas.DataFrame | A modified allele table where each cellBC/intBC pair is associated with a single allele. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Drops rows with missing `intBC` values from the input `molecule_table`.
2. Groups the remaining rows by `cellBC`, `intBC`, and `allele`.
3. Aggregates the groups by summing `readCount` and counting `UMI`.
4. Sorts the aggregated table first by `UMI` in descending order, then by `readCount` in descending order.
5. Identifies duplicate `cellBC`/`intBC` pairs, keeping only the first occurrence (which corresponds to the highest read and UMI count).
6. Creates a set of tuples representing the selected `cellBC`, `intBC`, and `allele` combinations.
7. Filters the original `molecule_table` to keep only rows where the `cellBC`, `intBC`, and `allele` combination exists in the set created in step 6.
8. Logs the number of removed alleles and UMIs during the filtering process.
9. Returns the filtered `molecule_table`.

## Side Effects
- Logs debug messages indicating the number of alleles and UMIs removed during the filtering process.

## Performance Considerations
The function uses pandas groupby and apply operations, which can be computationally expensive for large datasets. Consider optimizing these operations or using alternative data structures if performance becomes a bottleneck.
