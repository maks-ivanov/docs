## High-level description
This file provides utility functions for the Cassiopeia-Preprocess pipeline, including filtering cells and UMIs, error correcting integration barcodes, converting allele tables to character matrices and lineage profiles, and computing empirical indel priors. These functions are used to process and prepare sequencing data for phylogenetic inference.

## Code Structure
The file defines several functions that operate on Pandas DataFrames representing molecule tables and allele tables. These functions perform filtering, error correction, and conversion operations to prepare the data for downstream analysis. Some functions are decorated with `log_molecule_table` and `log_runtime` decorators to provide logging and runtime information.

## References
This file references symbols from the `ngs_tools` library for sequence manipulation and analysis, as well as the `cassiopeia.mixins` module for logging and warnings.

## Symbols

### `filter_cells`
#### Description
Filters out cell barcodes that have too few UMIs or too few reads per UMI, based on user-defined thresholds.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| molecule_table | pd.DataFrame | A molecule table of cellBC-UMI pairs to be filtered |
| min_umi_per_cell | int | Minimum number of UMIs per cell for cell to not be filtered. Defaults to 10. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |

#### Internal Logic
1. Groups the molecule table by cell barcode.
2. Calculates the number of UMIs and average reads per UMI for each cell.
