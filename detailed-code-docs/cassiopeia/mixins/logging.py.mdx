## High-level description

The target file `cassiopeia/mixins/logging.py` is responsible for setting up a logging mechanism for the Cassiopeia project. It imports the `logging` module and utilizes the `ngs_tools` library to create a logger instance. This logger is configured to log messages at the INFO level, which means it will capture informational messages and more severe messages like warnings and errors.

## Code Structure

The file contains a straightforward setup for logging using the `ngs_tools` library. The logger is created and configured in a few lines of code, indicating that this file's primary purpose is to establish a logging utility that can be used throughout the Cassiopeia project.

## Symbols

### `logger`
#### Description
The `logger` is an instance of a logging object created using the `ngs_tools` library. It is configured to log messages at the INFO level, which includes informational messages, warnings, errors, and critical messages. This logger is intended to be used across the Cassiopeia project to provide consistent logging behavior.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `__name__` | `str` | The name of the logger, typically the module name where the logger is created. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `logger` | `ngs.logging.Logger` | A logger instance configured to log messages at the INFO level. |

## References

- The `logger` is imported and used in other parts of the Cassiopeia project, as seen in the related files like `cassiopeia/mixins/__init__.py`, `cassiopeia/preprocess/UMI_utils.py`, `cassiopeia/preprocess/cassiopeia_preprocess.py`, `cassiopeia/preprocess/doublet_utils.py`, `cassiopeia/preprocess/lineage_utils.py`, and `cassiopeia/preprocess/map_utils.py`. This indicates that the logger is a central component for logging across different modules in the project.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `logging` | Provides the standard logging functionality in Python. |
| `ngs_tools` | A library that includes enhanced logging capabilities, used here to create the logger instance. |

## Logging

The file sets up a logging mechanism using the `ngs_tools` library, which is a wrapper or extension around Python's standard logging module. The logger is configured to log at the INFO level, which is suitable for capturing general operational messages, warnings, and errors. This setup ensures that the logging is consistent and centralized across the Cassiopeia project.

## Conclusion

The `cassiopeia/mixins/logging.py` file is a simple yet crucial part of the Cassiopeia project, providing a standardized logging setup that can be utilized across various modules. By using the `ngs_tools` library, it leverages enhanced logging capabilities, ensuring that the project can effectively capture and manage log messages.
