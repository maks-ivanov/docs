## High-level description
This code sets up a logger for the `cassiopeia.mixins` module using the `ngs_tools` library. It defines a logger object, sets its name to the module's name, and sets the logging level to INFO.

## References
- `ngs_tools`: This code directly uses the `ngs_tools` library for logging.

## Symbols
### `logger`
#### Description
This symbol is a logger object created using the `ngs.logging.Logger` class from the `ngs_tools` library. It is used for logging messages during the execution of the code within the `cassiopeia.mixins` module.

#### Inputs
The `logger` object itself doesn't take any direct inputs in this code snippet. However, it implicitly receives log messages from other parts of the `cassiopeia.mixins` module.

#### Outputs
The `logger` object doesn't have any direct outputs. Instead, it sends log messages to the configured output handlers, which are responsible for writing the messages to the appropriate destinations (e.g., console, file).

#### Internal Logic
The `logger` object's internal logic is handled by the `ngs_tools` library. It receives log messages from the `cassiopeia.mixins` module and, based on its configuration (name and logging level), determines whether to pass them on to the output handlers.

#### Side Effects
- **Logging**: The `logger` object, when invoked with log messages, will write those messages to the configured output handlers. This is the primary side effect of this symbol.

## Dependencies
- `ngs_tools`: This library provides the logging functionality used in the code.

## Logging
This code implements logging using the `ngs_tools` library. The `logger` object is configured to log messages at the INFO level, meaning that messages with severity INFO or higher (WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) will be logged. The specific output destinations for the log messages are not defined in this code snippet and are likely configured elsewhere in the `ngs_tools` library or in the code that utilizes this library.
