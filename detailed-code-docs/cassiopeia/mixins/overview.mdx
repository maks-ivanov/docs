## High-level description

The `cassiopeia/mixins` directory is a part of the Cassiopeia project, which is designed to handle various auxiliary functionalities that support the main operations of the project. This directory contains modules that define custom error and warning classes, set up logging, and provide utility functions. These components are essential for error handling, logging, and performing common operations across the Cassiopeia project.

The main components within this directory include:

- **Errors**: Custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions.
- **Logger**: A logging setup using the `ngs_tools` library to provide consistent logging across the project.
- **Utilities**: A set of utility functions for handling ambiguous states, dynamic module imports, and character matrix operations.
- **Warnings**: Custom warning classes for issuing specific warnings related to different functionalities.

## What does it do?

The `cassiopeia/mixins` directory provides foundational support for the Cassiopeia project by offering a structured way to handle errors, log messages, and perform utility operations. Here's how it works:

- **Error Handling**: The directory defines a variety of custom exception classes that are used to handle specific error conditions in a more descriptive manner. This allows the project to catch and manage errors more effectively, providing clear feedback on what went wrong.

- **Logging**: A logger is set up using the `ngs_tools` library, configured to log messages at the INFO level. This logger is used throughout the project to capture informational messages, warnings, and errors, helping developers track the flow of execution and diagnose issues.

- **Utility Functions**: The utilities provided include functions to determine if a state is ambiguous, dynamically import modules, unravel ambiguous states, and find duplicate groups in character matrices. These functions are used to simplify common tasks and handle complex data structures within the project.

- **Warnings**: Custom warning classes are defined to issue warnings specific to different components and functionalities. These warnings alert users to potential issues or important information without interrupting the program flow.

Overall, the `cassiopeia/mixins` directory enhances the robustness and maintainability of the Cassiopeia project by providing essential support functionalities.
