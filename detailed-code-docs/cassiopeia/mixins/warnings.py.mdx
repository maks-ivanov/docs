## High-level description
This file defines custom warning classes for various components of the Cassiopeia library. These warning classes inherit from the built-in `UserWarning` class and are used to provide specific warnings related to different aspects of the library's functionality.

## Code Structure
The code consists of several custom warning classes, each inheriting from `UserWarning`. These classes are defined to categorize warnings related to specific parts of the Cassiopeia library.

## Symbols

### `CassiopeiaTreeWarning`
#### Description
A general warning class for the `CassiopeiaTree` class, used to signal potential issues or unexpected behavior within the tree structure or operations.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
This class simply inherits from `UserWarning` and does not define any additional logic.

### `DataSimulatorWarning`
#### Description
A warning class for the data simulator component of the library, used to signal potential issues or unexpected behavior during data simulation.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
This class simply inherits from `UserWarning` and does not define any additional logic.

### `PreprocessWarning`
#### Description
A warning class for the preprocessing component of the library, used to signal potential issues or unexpected behavior during data preprocessing.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
This class simply inherits from `UserWarning` and does not define any additional logic.

### `SharedMutationJoiningSolverWarning`
#### Description
A warning class for the `SharedMutationJoiningSolver` class, used to signal potential issues or unexpected behavior during tree reconstruction using this solver.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
This class simply inherits from `UserWarning` and does not define any additional logic.

### `ParameterEstimateWarning`
#### Description
A warning class for the parameter estimation component of the library, used to signal potential issues or unexpected behavior during parameter estimation.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
This class simply inherits from `UserWarning` and does not define any additional logic.

### `PlottingWarning`
#### Description
A warning class for the plotting component of the library, used to signal potential issues or unexpected behavior during plotting.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
This class simply inherits from `UserWarning` and does not define any additional logic.

### `LeafSubsamplerWarning`
#### Description
A warning class for the `LeafSubsampler` class, used to signal potential issues or unexpected behavior during leaf subsampling.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
This class simply inherits from `UserWarning` and does not define any additional logic.
