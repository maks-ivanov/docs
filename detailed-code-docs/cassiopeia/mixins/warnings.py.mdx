## High-level description

The target file defines a set of custom warning classes that are used throughout the Cassiopeia library. These warnings are specific to different components or functionalities within the library, such as tree operations, data simulation, preprocessing, and plotting. Each warning class inherits from Python's built-in `UserWarning` class, allowing them to be used in the same way as standard warnings but with more specific context.

## Symbols

### `CassiopeiaTreeWarning`
#### Description
This class is a custom warning for the `CassiopeiaTree` class. It is used to signal issues or important notices related to operations on CassiopeiaTree objects.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

### `DataSimulatorWarning`
#### Description
This class is a custom warning for data simulation processes within the Cassiopeia library. It is used to alert users to potential issues or important information during data simulation tasks.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

### `PreprocessWarning`
#### Description
This class is a custom warning for preprocessing operations. It is used to notify users of potential issues or important information during data preprocessing steps.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

### `SharedMutationJoiningSolverWarning`
#### Description
This class is a custom warning for the `SharedMutationJoiningSolver`. It is used to alert users to potential issues or important information specific to the shared mutation joining solver algorithm.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

### `ParameterEstimateWarning`
#### Description
This class is a custom warning for the estimation and retrieval of tree parameters. It is used to notify users of potential issues or important information when estimating parameters related to the tree.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

### `PlottingWarning`
#### Description
This class is a custom warning for plotting operations. It is used to alert users to potential issues or important information during the plotting of trees or other data visualizations.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

### `LeafSubsamplerWarning`
#### Description
This class is a custom warning for the `LeafSubsampler` class. It is used to signal issues or important notices related to leaf subsampling operations.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

## Side Effects
These classes do not have side effects themselves but are used to generate warnings in other parts of the codebase, which can affect program flow if warnings are configured to raise exceptions.

## Dependencies
These warning classes are used throughout the Cassiopeia library in various modules, as seen in the related files. They are typically used in conjunction with Python's `warnings` module to provide users with information about non-critical issues that do not warrant exceptions but may require attention.
