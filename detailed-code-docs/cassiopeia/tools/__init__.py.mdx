## High-level description

The `cassiopeia/tools/__init__.py` file serves as the top-level module initializer for the `tools` package in the Cassiopeia library. It imports and exposes various functions and classes from submodules within the `tools` package, making them accessible when the package is imported. These tools are primarily focused on phylogenetic analysis, including metrics calculations, parameter estimations, and statistical computations related to evolutionary biology.

## Code Structure

The file imports several functions and classes from different submodules within the `tools` package. These imports are then included in the `__all__` list, which defines the public API of the module. This means that when the `tools` package is imported, only the symbols listed in `__all__` are accessible directly.

## References

The file references several submodules within the `tools` package, including:
- `autocorrelation`
- `branch_length_estimator`
- `coupling`
- `fitness_estimator`
- `parameter_estimators`
- `small_parsimony`
- `topology`
- `tree_metrics`

These submodules contain the actual implementations of the functions and classes that are imported and exposed in this file.

## Symbols

### `compute_morans_i`
#### Description
Computes Moran's I statistic, a measure of spatial autocorrelation, for data associated with a phylogenetic tree.

### `IIDExponentialBayesian`
#### Description
A class for estimating branch lengths using a Bayesian approach under the assumption of independent and identically distributed exponential branch lengths.

### `IIDExponentialMLE`
#### Description
A class for estimating branch lengths using maximum likelihood estimation under the assumption of independent and identically distributed exponential branch lengths.

### `compute_evolutionary_coupling`
#### Description
Calculates the evolutionary coupling statistic for categorical variables on a phylogenetic tree, indicating how closely related different categories are.

### `FitnessEstimator`
#### Description
An abstract base class for fitness estimation algorithms, requiring derived classes to implement the `estimate_fitness` method.

### `FitnessEstimatorError`
#### Description
An exception class for errors related to the `FitnessEstimator` class.

### `LBIJungle`
#### Description
A class implementing the LBI fitness estimator using the Jungle package, which is a wrapper around Neher et al.'s code.

### `estimate_missing_data_rates`
#### Description
Estimates the rates of missing data in a phylogenetic tree, distinguishing between stochastic and heritable missing data.

### `estimate_mutation_rate`
#### Description
Estimates the mutation rate from a phylogenetic tree and its associated character matrix.

### `fitch_count`
#### Description
Implements the FitchCount algorithm to infer the number of state transitions across all equally-parsimonious solutions in a phylogenetic tree.

### `fitch_hartigan`
#### Description
Runs the Fitch-Hartigan algorithm to infer the most-parsimonious set of states for a phylogenetic tree.

### `score_small_parsimony`
#### Description
Calculates the parsimony score of a phylogenetic tree, which is the number of state changes required to explain the observed data.

### `compute_cophenetic_correlation`
#### Description
Calculates the cophenetic correlation, a measure of how well a phylogenetic tree reflects the dissimilarity between samples.

### `compute_expansion_pvalues`
#### Description
Calculates expansion p-values for subclades in a phylogenetic tree, assessing the probability of observing a given clade size under a neutral model.

### `calculate_likelihood_continuous`
#### Description
Calculates the log likelihood of a phylogenetic tree under a continuous model of lineage tracing, using branch lengths.

### `calculate_likelihood_discrete`
#### Description
Calculates the log likelihood of a phylogenetic tree under a discrete model of lineage tracing, without using branch lengths.

### `calculate_parsimony`
#### Description
Calculates the parsimony of a phylogenetic tree, defined as the number of character state changes required to explain the observed data.

## Dependencies

The file does not directly import any external libraries, but the functions and classes it imports from other submodules may have dependencies on libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy.

## Error Handling

The file itself does not implement any error handling, but some of the imported functions and classes, such as `FitnessEstimatorError`, are designed to handle specific errors related to their functionality.

## Logging

The file does not implement any logging mechanisms.
