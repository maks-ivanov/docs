## High-level description

The target file `cassiopeia/tools/branch_length_estimator/__init__.py` serves as the top-level module for the branch length estimator tools within the Cassiopeia library. It imports two specific classes, `IIDExponentialMLE` and `IIDExponentialBayesian`, which are used for estimating branch lengths in phylogenetic trees under different statistical models. These classes are designed to handle the estimation of branch lengths assuming independent and identically distributed (IID) mutations with exponential waiting times, using either maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or Bayesian inference methods.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in this file are the imports of the `IIDExponentialMLE` and `IIDExponentialBayesian` classes. These classes are part of the branch length estimation tools and are likely used elsewhere in the Cassiopeia library to perform specific tasks related to phylogenetic analysis.

## References

The file references two classes from the same directory:
- `IIDExponentialMLE`: A class for maximum likelihood estimation of branch lengths.
- `IIDExponentialBayesian`: A class for Bayesian estimation of branch lengths.

## Symbols

### `IIDExponentialMLE`
#### Description
The `IIDExponentialMLE` class is used for estimating branch lengths in a phylogenetic tree using maximum likelihood estimation under a model of IID memoryless CRISPR/Cas9 mutations. It assumes that each site mutates independently and identically with an exponential waiting time.

### `IIDExponentialBayesian`
#### Description
The `IIDExponentialBayesian` class is used for estimating branch lengths using Bayesian inference under a model that assumes IID memoryless mutations and a subsampled Birth Process for the phylogeny. It uses the posterior mean branch lengths as estimates.

## Dependencies

The target file does not directly list any external dependencies, but the related classes (`IIDExponentialMLE` and `IIDExponentialBayesian`) rely on several Python libraries such as `numpy`, `cvxpy`, and potentially others for mathematical computations and optimization tasks.

## Error Handling

The target file itself does not implement any error handling, but the related classes handle various errors such as invalid input parameters and solver failures.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in the target file itself. However, the related classes may include logging or verbosity options, particularly in the context of optimization and estimation processes.

## API/Interface Reference

The target file does not define an API or public interface directly. It serves as an entry point for importing the branch length estimation classes, which are then used elsewhere in the Cassiopeia library.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the target file.
