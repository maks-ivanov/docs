## High-level description
The `IIDExponentialMLE` class implements a Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) for inferring branch lengths of a tree under the assumption of independent and identically distributed (IID) memoryless CRISPR/Cas9 mutations with an exponential waiting time. This estimator assumes a tree depth of 1 and utilizes convex optimization to find the mutation rate and branch lengths that maximize the likelihood of the observed character data.

## Code Structure
The `IIDExponentialMLE` class inherits from the abstract base class `BranchLengthEstimator` and implements the `estimate_branch_lengths` method. This method constructs and solves a convex optimization problem to estimate the branch lengths and mutation rate.

## References
This code references the following key symbols:
- `CassiopeiaTree`: Used to represent the tree structure and character data.
- `IIDExponentialMLEError`: A custom exception class for errors specific to this estimator.

## Symbols

### `IIDExponentialMLE`
#### Description
This class implements the IID Exponential MLE algorithm for estimating branch lengths in a phylogenetic tree. It assumes that mutations occur independently and identically at each site with an exponential waiting time.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| minimum_branch_length | float | Minimum allowed branch length (default: 0.01) |
| relative_mutation_rates | Optional[List[float]] | List of relative mutation rates for each character site (default: None, meaning all sites evolve at the same rate) |
| verbose | bool | Whether to print verbose output during optimization (default: False) |
| solver | str | Convex optimization solver to use (default: "SCS", options: "ECOS", "SCS", "MOSEK") |

#### Outputs
This class doesn't directly return any outputs. Instead, it modifies the input `CassiopeiaTree` object in place, updating the branch lengths and storing the estimated mutation rate and log-likelihood as attributes.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Data Validation:** Checks for degenerate cases like no mutations or complete saturation in the character matrix.
2. **Problem Setup:**
    - Creates optimization variables for each node's time.
    - Defines constraints:
        - Root node has time 0.
        - Minimum branch length constraint.
        - Ultrametric constraint for all leaves (except the reference leaf).
    - Formulates the log-likelihood function based on the IID exponential mutation model.
3. **Optimization:**
    - Defines the objective function as maximizing the log-likelihood.
    - Constructs and solves the convex optimization problem using the specified solver.
4. **Result Extraction:**
    - Extracts the estimated mutation rate from the scaling factor of the reference leaf's time.
    - Retrieves the log-likelihood value.
5. **Tree Update:**
    - Computes and sets the branch lengths based on the optimized node times.
    - Updates the `CassiopeiaTree` object with the estimated branch lengths.

#### Side Effects
- Modifies the input `CassiopeiaTree` object in place by updating its branch lengths.
- Sets the `mutation_rate` and `log_likelihood` attributes of the `IIDExponentialMLE` object.

#### Performance Considerations
- The choice of solver can impact the performance of the optimization.
- The `minimum_branch_length` parameter can influence the convergence and runtime of the solver.
- Specifying `relative_mutation_rates` can increase the complexity of the optimization problem.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| cvxpy | Used for defining and solving the convex optimization problem. |
| numpy | Used for numerical operations. |

## Error Handling
- Raises `ValueError` for invalid input parameters or degenerate character matrices.
- Raises `IIDExponentialMLEError` if the solver fails or produces unexpected results.
