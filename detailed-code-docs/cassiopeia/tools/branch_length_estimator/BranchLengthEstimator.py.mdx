## High-level description
This code defines an abstract base class `BranchLengthEstimator` for branch length estimation algorithms in the Cassiopeia framework. It serves as a template for concrete branch length estimation algorithms, requiring them to implement the `estimate_branch_lengths` method.

## Code Structure
The `BranchLengthEstimator` class is an abstract base class defined using the `abc` module. It has a single abstract method, `estimate_branch_lengths`, which needs to be implemented by concrete subclasses.

## Symbols
### Symbol Name: `BranchLengthEstimator`
#### Description
This is an abstract base class for all branch length estimation algorithms. It defines a common interface for these algorithms, ensuring that they all have an `estimate_branch_lengths` method.

#### Inputs
The class itself does not take any inputs during initialization.

#### Outputs
The class itself does not return any outputs.

#### Internal Logic
This is an abstract base class and does not have any internal logic.

### Symbol Name: `estimate_branch_lengths`
#### Description
This is an abstract method that needs to be implemented by subclasses. It should estimate the branch lengths of a given tree.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tree | CassiopeiaTree | CassiopeiaTree object storing character information and an initialized tree topology. |

#### Outputs
This method does not return any values. It should modify the input `tree` object in-place, updating the branch lengths.

#### Internal Logic
The internal logic of this method is specific to the concrete subclass that implements it.
