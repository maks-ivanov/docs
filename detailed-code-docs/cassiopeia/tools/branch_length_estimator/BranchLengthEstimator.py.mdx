## High-level description

The `BranchLengthEstimator.py` file defines an abstract class `BranchLengthEstimator` for estimating branch lengths in phylogenetic trees. This class serves as a base class for all branch length estimation algorithms, requiring derived classes to implement the `estimate_branch_lengths` method. The purpose of this class is to provide a standardized interface for different branch length estimation algorithms that can be applied to a `CassiopeiaTree`, which is a data structure representing a phylogenetic tree with associated character data.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in this file is the `BranchLengthEstimator` class, which is an abstract base class. It is designed to be subclassed by specific branch length estimation algorithms, such as those found in related files like `IIDExponentialBayesian` and `IIDExponentialMLE`. These subclasses implement the `estimate_branch_lengths` method to provide specific algorithms for branch length estimation.

## Symbols

### `BranchLengthEstimator`
#### Description
The `BranchLengthEstimator` is an abstract base class that defines a common interface for branch length estimation algorithms. It requires any subclass to implement the `estimate_branch_lengths` method, which is responsible for estimating the branch lengths of a given `CassiopeiaTree`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tree | `CassiopeiaTree` | A tree structure containing character information and an initialized tree topology. |

#### Outputs
This class does not produce direct outputs as it is an abstract class. The outputs are expected to be defined by the subclasses implementing the `estimate_branch_lengths` method.

## References

- The `BranchLengthEstimator` class references the `CassiopeiaTree` class from the `cassiopeia.data` module. This class is crucial for understanding the context in which the branch length estimation algorithms operate, as it provides the tree structure and character data needed for the estimation process.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `abc` | Used to define the abstract base class `BranchLengthEstimator`. |
| `cassiopeia.data.CassiopeiaTree` | Provides the tree structure and character data for branch length estimation. |

## Error Handling

The `BranchLengthEstimator` class itself does not implement specific error handling mechanisms, as it is an abstract class. Error handling is expected to be implemented in the subclasses that define the `estimate_branch_lengths` method.

## Logging

There are no logging mechanisms implemented in this abstract class. Logging, if needed, would be implemented in the subclasses.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
