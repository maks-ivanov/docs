## High-level description

The `cassiopeia/tools/fitness_estimator/_jungle` directory is part of a project focused on evolutionary biology, specifically targeting phylogenetic analysis and fitness estimation. This directory is divided into two main subdirectories: `jungle` and `reference_data`. The `jungle` subdirectory contains modules for constructing, manipulating, and analyzing phylogenetic trees, as well as simulating genetic diversity and calculating statistical measures from genetic data. The `reference_data` subdirectory includes a script for generating and annotating a forest of phylogenetic trees.

### Main Components

- **`jungle` Subdirectory**:
  - **`forest.py`**: Defines a `Forest` class for managing collections of phylogenetic trees.
  - **`sfs.py`**: Contains the `SFS` class for statistical analysis of genetic data.
  - **`size_matched_model.py`**: Implements the `SizeMatchedModel` class for statistical modeling.
  - **`tree.py`**: Defines a `Tree` class for phylogenetic tree representation and analysis.
  - **`__init__.py`**: Initializes the `jungle` module, making its components accessible.

- **`reference_data` Subdirectory**:
  - **`generate_annotate_forest.py`**: A script for generating and annotating phylogenetic trees.

## What does it do?

The directory provides tools and scripts for analyzing evolutionary processes through phylogenetic trees:

1. **Phylogenetic Tree Management**: The `Forest` and `Tree` classes allow users to load, manipulate, and analyze phylogenetic trees. This includes annotating nodes with features and performing statistical analyses to infer evolutionary dynamics.

2. **Statistical Analysis**: The `SFS` class calculates statistical measures from genetic mutation data, aiding in the understanding of evolutionary dynamics and population genetics.

3. **Modeling and Simulation**: The `SizeMatchedModel` class supports statistical modeling matched to specific size bins, useful for simulating genetic diversity.

4. **Data Integration and Visualization**: The `Tree` class provides visualization capabilities for phylogenetic trees, enabling users to render and analyze them visually.

5. **Forest Generation and Annotation**: The `generate_annotate_forest.py` script generates a forest of phylogenetic trees based on user-defined parameters, annotates them, and saves the result for further analysis.

## Entry points

The main entry points for this directory are the modules within the `jungle` subdirectory and the `generate_annotate_forest.py` script in the `reference_data` subdirectory. The `jungle` modules provide the core functionality for tree management and analysis, while the script in `reference_data` is used for generating and annotating phylogenetic trees.

## Dependencies

The directory relies on several external libraries and modules:

- **`sys`**: Used for reading command-line arguments in scripts.
- **`time`**: Utilized for measuring execution time.
- **`uuid`**: Generates unique identifiers for file naming.
- **`jungle`**: Provides the core classes and methods for tree generation and annotation.

These dependencies are essential for the functionality provided by the directory, enabling command-line interaction, performance measurement, and unique file management.
