## High-level description
The code defines a `Forest` class in Python, representing a collection of phylogenetic trees. It provides functionalities for loading, generating, manipulating, analyzing, and saving these tree collections. This includes methods for calculating various phylogenetic statistics, annotating tree nodes with features, and visualizing the trees.

## Code Structure
The `Forest` class is the main component, containing methods for manipulating collections of `Tree` objects. The `Tree` class (defined in a separate file) represents a single phylogenetic tree and provides methods for manipulating and analyzing individual trees. The `Forest` class leverages the functionalities of the `Tree` class to operate on entire collections of trees.

## References
- `jungle.tree.Tree`: The `Forest` class heavily relies on the `Tree` class for individual tree operations.
