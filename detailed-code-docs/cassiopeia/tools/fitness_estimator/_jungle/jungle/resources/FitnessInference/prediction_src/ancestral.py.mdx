## High-level description
The code defines a class `ancestral_sequences` that takes a phylogenetic tree and a multiple sequence alignment as input. It then performs maximum likelihood estimation to infer the most likely ancestral sequences for each internal node in the tree, along with the marginal probabilities of different character states at each position.

## Code Structure
The `ancestral_sequences` class is the main component of the code. It uses Biopython's `Phylo` and `Seq` objects to represent the tree and sequences, respectively. The class methods implement a message-passing algorithm to calculate the ancestral sequences and marginal probabilities.

## References
This code references Biopython library (`Phylo`, `Seq`, `SeqRecord`).

## Symbols

### `ancestral_sequences`
#### Description
This class performs ancestral sequence reconstruction using a maximum likelihood approach. It takes a phylogenetic tree and aligned sequences as input and infers the most likely ancestral sequences for internal nodes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tree | Bio.Phylo.BaseTree.Tree | A Biopython phylogenetic tree object. |
| aln | Bio.Align.MultipleSeqAlignment | A Biopython multiple sequence alignment object. |
| alphabet | str | The set of allowed characters in the sequences (default: "ACGT"). |
| sub_matrix | numpy.ndarray | A substitution matrix (optional, defaults to a flat matrix). |
| eps_branch_length | float | A small value added to branch lengths to prevent division by zero (default: 1e-7). |
| copy_tree | bool | Whether to create a copy of the input tree (default: True). |

#### Outputs
The class itself doesn't return any output. However, it modifies the input tree object by adding ancestral sequences and marginal probabilities to the internal nodes.

#### Internal Logic
The class uses a message-passing algorithm, similar to dynamic programming, to calculate the ancestral sequences. The algorithm works by passing messages up and down the tree, representing the likelihood of different ancestral states at each node. The messages are calculated based on the observed sequences at the leaves, the branch lengths, and the substitution matrix.

1. **Initialization:** Each leaf node is assigned its observed sequence and a probability array representing the certainty of the observed state. Internal nodes are initialized with uniform probability arrays.
2. **Upward Pass (calc_up_messages):** Starting from the leaves, messages are passed upwards towards the root. Each node combines the messages from its children, weighting them by the branch lengths and the substitution probabilities.
3. **Downward Pass (calc_down_messages):** From the root, messages are passed downwards towards the leaves. Each node combines the message from its parent with the upward messages from its other children.
4. **Marginal Probabilities (calc_marginal_probabilities):** The upward and downward messages are combined at each node to calculate the marginal probability of each character state at each position.
5. **Most Likely Sequences (calc_most_likely_sequences):** The most likely ancestral sequence at each node is determined by selecting the character state with the highest marginal probability at each position.

#### Side Effects
The main side effect is the modification of the input tree object. The ancestral sequences and marginal probabilities are stored within the internal nodes of the tree.
