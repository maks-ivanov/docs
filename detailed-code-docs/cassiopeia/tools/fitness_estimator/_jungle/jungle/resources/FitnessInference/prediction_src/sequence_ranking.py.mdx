## High-level description
The code defines two classes, `alignment` and `sequence_ranking`, for analyzing and ranking sequences within a phylogenetic tree. The `alignment` class processes sequence data, calculates allele frequencies, and builds a phylogenetic tree. The `sequence_ranking` class extends the `node_ranking` class and uses the processed alignment data to predict and rank nodes based on fitness.

## Code Structure
The `alignment` class is responsible for handling sequence data, while the `sequence_ranking` class utilizes this data for ranking nodes in a phylogenetic tree. The `sequence_ranking` class inherits from the `node_ranking` class, which provides functionalities for ranking nodes based on different methods.

## References

- `node_ranking`: The `sequence_ranking` class inherits from this class, utilizing its ranking functionalities.

## Symbols

### `alignment`
#### Description
This class stores and processes sequence alignments, calculates allele frequencies, and builds phylogenetic trees.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| aln | Bio.Align.MultipleSeqAlignment | A Biopython MultipleSeqAlignment object representing the sequence alignment. |
| outgroup | str | The outgroup sequence used for rooting the phylogenetic tree. |
| cds | dict | A dictionary specifying the coding region within the alignment. |
| collapse | bool | Flag indicating whether to collapse zero-length branches in the tree. |
| build_tree | bool | Flag indicating whether to build a phylogenetic tree from the alignment. |

#### Outputs
The class does not have explicit return values but stores processed data and the constructed tree internally.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Initialization:** Stores input parameters, sets default values, and calls `process_alignment`.
2. **`process_alignment`:** Calculates alignment summary information, consensus sequence, allele frequencies, and optionally translates the alignment if it's a protein sequence. It then builds the phylogenetic tree using `tree_utils.calculate_tree`.
3. **`calculate_allele_frequencies`:** Computes the frequency of each nucleotide/amino acid at each position in the alignment.
4. **`calculate_aa_allele_frequencies`:** Specifically calculates amino acid frequencies for protein alignments.
5. **`translate_alignment`:** Translates the nucleotide alignment to an amino acid alignment based on the provided coding region.
6. **`mean_distance_to_sequence`:** Calculates the average Hamming distance between a query sequence and the alignment based on allele frequencies.
7. **`mean_distance_to_set`:** Calculates the average Hamming distance between two alignments based on their allele frequencies.
8. **`aa_distance_to_sequence`:** Calculates the average Hamming distance between a query amino acid sequence and the alignment.
9. **`aa_distance_to_set`:** Calculates the average Hamming distance between two amino acid alignments.
10. **`build_tree`:** Constructs a phylogenetic tree using the alignment and outgroup sequence, infers ancestral sequences, and optionally collapses zero-length branches.

### `sequence_ranking`
#### Description
This class extends the `node_ranking` class to handle sequence data. It builds a phylogenetic tree from the provided alignment and uses the ranking functionalities inherited from `node_ranking` to predict and rank nodes based on fitness.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sequence_data | alignment | An instance of the `alignment` class containing the processed sequence data. |
| distance_scale | float | A scaling factor for the branch lengths in the phylogenetic tree. |
| *args | tuple | Additional arguments passed to the `node_ranking` constructor. |
| **kwargs | dict | Additional keyword arguments passed to the `node_ranking` constructor. |

#### Outputs
The class does not have explicit return values but stores the ranking results internally.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Initialization:** Calls the `node_ranking` constructor, stores the input data and parameters, calculates the coalescence time scale, and sets the phylogenetic tree.
2. **`predict`:** Initializes the fitness inference process, computes node rankings, and returns the highest-ranked external node based on the specified ranking method.

## Dependencies
- Biopython (Bio)
- NumPy (numpy)
- SciPy (scipy)

## Error Handling
The code includes basic error handling using `try-except` blocks, primarily for handling potential translation errors and missing attributes. However, it does not implement specific error types or custom exception handling.
