## High-level description
This code defines a class `SFS` that simulates the evolution of genetic sequences under a beta coalescent model and calculates the Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS) from the generated genealogical trees. The SFS represents the distribution of allele frequencies in a population sample.

## Code Structure
The `SFS` class inherits from the `betatree` class, which is responsible for generating the beta coalescent trees. The `SFS` class extends this functionality by accumulating allele frequency information from multiple trees and calculating the SFS. It also provides methods for binning and saving the calculated SFS.

## References
This code references the `betatree` class from the same package, specifically the `coalesce` method for generating the trees and accessing tree nodes for allele frequency calculations. It also uses the `Bio.Phylo` module for working with phylogenetic trees.

## Symbols

### Symbol Name: `SFS`
#### Description:
This class simulates the evolution of genetic sequences under a beta coalescent model and calculates the Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS).

#### Inputs:
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sample_size | int | The number of individuals in the sample. |
| alpha | float | The alpha parameter of the beta coalescent model (default: 2). |

#### Outputs:
The class does not have a direct return value. It stores the calculated SFS and related data in its internal attributes.

#### Internal Logic:
1. **Initialization:** Initializes the `SFS` object by calling the constructor of the parent class `betatree` and initializing internal variables to store allele frequencies and the SFS.
2. **Tree Generation and SFS Calculation:** The `glob_trees` method generates multiple beta coalescent trees using the inherited `coalesce` method. For each tree, it extracts the branch lengths and corresponding allele counts (weights) and stores them. The `getSFS` method then uses this accumulated data to calculate the average SFS over all generated trees.
3. **SFS Binning:** The `binSFS` method allows for binning the calculated SFS using different modes (linear, log, logit) and binning schemes. It calculates the bin edges, bin widths, and the binned SFS values.
4. **SFS Input/Output:** The `saveSFS` method saves a calculated SFS to a file, while the `loadSFS` method loads a previously saved SFS from a file.

#### Side Effects:
The `glob_trees` and `getSFS` methods modify the internal state of the `SFS` object by generating trees, accumulating allele frequencies, and calculating the SFS.

### Symbol Name: `logit`
#### Description:
This function calculates the logit of a given value.

#### Inputs:
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| x | float | The input value. |

#### Outputs:
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| logit(x) | float | The logit of the input value. |

#### Internal Logic:
The function calculates the logit using the formula: `log(x / (1 - x))`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| numpy | Numerical operations, array handling. |
| scipy.special | Special functions, including the gamma function used in beta coalescent calculations. |
| Bio.Phylo | Working with phylogenetic trees. |
| matplotlib.pyplot | Plotting the SFS (only in the example usage). |

## Error Handling
The code includes basic error handling when loading an SFS from a file. It checks if the file exists and if the loaded data has the expected one-dimensional shape. If an error occurs, it prints an error message but does not raise an exception.

## Logging
The code does not implement any specific logging mechanisms. It uses `print` statements for informational output.

## API/Interface Reference
This code does not define an explicit API. It provides a class `SFS` with methods for simulating the evolutionary process, calculating the SFS, and interacting with SFS data.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs or notes left in the code.
