title: "__init__.py"

## High-level description
The target file `cassiopeia/tools/fitness_estimator/_jungle/jungle/__init__.py` serves as an initializer for the `jungle` module within the `fitness_estimator` package. It imports all the symbols (classes, functions, variables) from four different modules: `forest`, `sfs`, `size_matched_model`, and `tree`. This setup allows users to access the functionalities of these modules directly through the `jungle` namespace.

## Code Structure
The `__init__.py` file is a part of the Python package structure and is used to initialize a Python package. In this case, it imports all the contents from the modules `forest`, `sfs`, `size_matched_model`, and `tree`. This means that any class, function, or variable defined in these modules will be accessible when the `jungle` package is imported.

## References
The target file references the following modules:
- `forest`
- `sfs`
- `size_matched_model`
- `tree`

These modules are expected to be located in the same directory as the `__init__.py` file.

## Symbols
Since the target file only contains import statements, there are no new symbols defined within it. However, it makes the symbols from the imported modules available under the `jungle` namespace.

## Dependencies
The target file itself does not have any external dependencies, but it relies on the presence of the `forest`, `sfs`, `size_matched_model`, and `tree` modules within the same package.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in the target file. However, if any of the imported modules are missing or contain errors, it will result in an ImportError or other exceptions when the package is imported.

## Logging
There is no logging implemented in the target file.

## API/Interface Reference
The target file does not define an API or public interface directly. It serves to aggregate and expose the interfaces of the imported modules.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the target file.
