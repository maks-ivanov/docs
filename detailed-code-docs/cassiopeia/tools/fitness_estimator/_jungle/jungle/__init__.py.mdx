## High-level description
This file serves as a package initializer for the `jungle` module, which seems to be related to phylogenetic tree analysis, specifically focusing on fitness estimation. It imports and exposes functionality from submodules dealing with "forest", "sfs" (likely Site Frequency Spectrum), "size_matched_model", and "tree" data structures and algorithms. 

## Code Structure
This file uses relative imports to include symbols from submodules within the `jungle` package. These submodules likely contain classes and functions related to different aspects of phylogenetic tree analysis.

## Symbols
### `*` (from `.forest`, `.sfs`, `.size_matched_model`, `.tree`)
#### Description
The `*` symbol indicates that all public symbols (functions, classes, etc.) are imported from the specified submodules (`forest`, `sfs`, `size_matched_model`, and `tree`) and made available directly through the `jungle` package namespace. 

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a module-level import, not a function or class.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a module-level import, not a function or class.

#### Internal Logic
N/A - This is a module-level import, not a function or class.
