## High-level description
The `Tree` class represents a phylogenetic tree and provides methods for manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing it. It supports constructing trees from Newick files, generating trees by simulation, and performing various operations like annotating nodes with features, calculating tree statistics, and inferring fitness.

## Code Structure
The `Tree` class encapsulates an `ete3.Tree` object and extends its functionality with custom methods. It utilizes external libraries like `ete3` for tree manipulation, `Bio.Phylo` for interfacing with Biopython, and other modules for specific tasks like site frequency spectrum analysis and fitness inference.

## References
This code references the following external libraries and modules:
- `ete3`: Used for phylogenetic tree manipulation and visualization.
- `Bio.Phylo`: Used for interfacing with Biopython's phylogenetic tree representation.
- `.resources.betatree.src.betatree`: Used for simulating trees using the beta-tree model.
- `.resources.FitnessInference.prediction_src.node_ranking`: Used for inferring fitness metrics of nodes.
- `jungle.sfs.SFS`: Used for calculating and analyzing site frequency spectra.

#### Outputs
This class does not have a return value. It is used to create and manipulate Tree objects.

#### Internal Logic
The `Tree` class stores the tree structure in an `ete3.Tree` object and provides methods for:
- Loading and saving trees from/to files.
- Generating trees by simulation.

## Side Effects
Some methods of the `Tree` class modify the internal state of the `ete3.Tree` object, such as adding new attributes to nodes or changing branch lengths.

#### Performance Considerations
The performance of some methods, especially those involving tree traversal or complex calculations, may vary depending on the size and complexity of the tree.
