## High-level description
This script generates and annotates a collection of phylogenetic trees (a "forest") using the `jungle` library. It allows specifying the number of trees, leaves per tree, and a shape parameter controlling the tree structure. The resulting annotated forest is then saved to a compressed pickle file.

## References
This script references the `jungle` library (`jg`) for phylogenetic tree generation and manipulation.

## Symbols
### `generate_annotate_forest.py`
#### Description
This script generates a collection of phylogenetic trees, annotates them with various features, and saves the resulting forest data structure to a file.

#### Inputs
This script takes its input from command line arguments:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `n_leaves` | int | Number of leaves (tips) in each generated tree. |
| `n_trees` | int | Number of trees to generate for the forest. |
| `alpha` | float | Shape parameter influencing the tree structure (2.0 for neutral, 1.0 for positive selection). |
| `output_dir` | str | Path to the directory where the output file will be saved. |

#### Outputs
The script generates a gzipped pickle file containing the annotated forest data structure. The file name is based on the input parameters and a unique identifier.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Parameter Parsing:** Reads input parameters from command line arguments.
2. **Output File Naming:** Constructs the output file name based on input parameters and a UUID.
3. **Forest Generation:** Uses the `jungle` library to generate a forest of `n_trees` trees, each with `n_leaves` leaves, using the specified `alpha` shape parameter.
4. **Forest Annotation:**
    - Resolves potential multifurcations (polytomies) in the generated trees.
    - Annotates the trees with standard node features (e.g., distance to root).
    - Calculates and annotates the Colless index for each tree, a measure of tree balance.
5. **Forest Serialization:** Saves the annotated forest object to a gzipped pickle file.

#### Side Effects
- Creates a file in the specified output directory.
- Prints status messages and timing information to the console if `verbose` is True.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `jungle` | Provides functionality for phylogenetic tree generation, manipulation, and analysis. |
| `sys` | Used for accessing command line arguments.
| `time` | Used for tracking the script's execution time.
| `uuid` | Used for generating a unique identifier for the output file.
| `pickle` | Used for serializing and saving the forest object.
| `gzip` | Used for compressing the output pickle file.

## Configuration
The script's behavior is controlled by command line arguments, as described in the "Inputs" section.

## Logging
The script prints informative messages to the console if the `verbose` variable is set to `True`. This includes parameter values, progress updates, and timing information.
