## High-level description
This file serves as the top-level entry point for the fitness estimator module in Cassiopeia. It exposes the main components, including the abstract `FitnessEstimator` class and the concrete `LBIJungle` implementation.

## References
- `cassiopeia.tools.fitness_estimator._FitnessEstimator`: Defines the abstract `FitnessEstimator` class and the `FitnessEstimatorError` exception.
- `cassiopeia.tools.fitness_estimator._lbi_jungle`: Implements the `LBIJungle` class, a concrete fitness estimator based on the LBI algorithm.

## Symbols
### Symbol Name
  `FitnessEstimator`

#### Description
  An abstract class defining the interface for fitness estimation algorithms in Cassiopeia. It mandates the implementation of the `estimate_fitness` method by its subclasses.

#### Inputs
  N/A (abstract class)

#### Outputs
  N/A (abstract class)

### Symbol Name
  `FitnessEstimatorError`

#### Description
  An exception class specific to the `FitnessEstimator` class, used to signal errors during fitness estimation.

#### Inputs
  N/A (exception class)

#### Outputs
  N/A (exception class)

### Symbol Name
  `LBIJungle`

#### Description
  A concrete implementation of the `FitnessEstimator` class that utilizes the LBI (lineage birth and immigration) algorithm for estimating fitness. It leverages the external `jungle` package for the core LBI calculations.

#### Inputs
  N/A (class instantiation)

#### Outputs
  N/A (class instantiation)
