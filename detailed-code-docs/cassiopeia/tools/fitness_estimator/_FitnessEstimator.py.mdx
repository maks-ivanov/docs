## High-level description
The `FitnessEstimator` class in `cassiopeia/tools/fitness_estimator/_FitnessEstimator.py` defines an abstract base class for all fitness estimation algorithms in the Cassiopeia library. It mandates that all derived classes implement the `estimate_fitness` method, which calculates and assigns a 'fitness' attribute to each node in a given `CassiopeiaTree`.

## Code Structure
The code defines an abstract base class `FitnessEstimator` and a custom exception class `FitnessEstimatorError`. The `FitnessEstimator` class has a single abstract method, `estimate_fitness`, which needs to be implemented by concrete fitness estimation algorithm classes.

## References
This code references the `CassiopeiaTree` class from `cassiopeia.data`.

## Symbols
### `FitnessEstimatorError`
#### Description
This class represents an exception specific to the `FitnessEstimator` class and its subclasses. It is raised when errors occur during fitness estimation.

#### Inputs
_This class does not have any inputs._

#### Outputs
_This class does not have any outputs._

### `FitnessEstimator`
#### Description
This abstract base class defines the interface for all fitness estimation algorithms. It requires derived classes to implement the `estimate_fitness` method.

#### Inputs
_This class does not have any inputs._

#### Outputs
_This class does not have any outputs._

#### Internal Logic
_This class does not have any internal logic._

### `FitnessEstimator.estimate_fitness`
#### Description
This abstract method defines the interface for estimating the fitness of nodes in a `CassiopeiaTree`. Concrete fitness estimation algorithms must implement this method.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tree | CassiopeiaTree | A `CassiopeiaTree` object representing the tree for which to estimate fitness. |

#### Outputs
_This method does not return any values. It modifies the input `CassiopeiaTree` object directly._

#### Internal Logic
_This method is abstract and therefore has no implementation in the base class._

## Side Effects
This code modifies the input `CassiopeiaTree` object in the `estimate_fitness` method by adding a 'fitness' attribute to each node.

## TODOs
_This code does not contain any TODOs._
