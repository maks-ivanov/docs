## High-level description

The `cassiopeia/tools` directory is a comprehensive module within the Cassiopeia library, designed to facilitate various aspects of phylogenetic analysis. It provides a suite of tools for calculating metrics, estimating parameters, and performing statistical computations related to evolutionary biology. The directory is organized into several submodules, each focusing on specific tasks such as branch length estimation, fitness estimation, and small-parsimony analysis. These tools are essential for researchers working on evolutionary studies, particularly those involving lineage tracing and phylogenetic tree analysis.

## What does it do?

The `cassiopeia/tools` directory offers a range of functionalities to support phylogenetic analysis:

1. **Phylogenetic Metrics and Calculations**: The directory includes tools for computing various metrics on phylogenetic trees, such as Moran's I for spatial autocorrelation, evolutionary coupling statistics, and cophenetic correlation. These metrics help assess the relationships and similarities between different categories or samples in a tree.

2. **Branch Length Estimation**: The directory provides methods for estimating branch lengths in phylogenetic trees using Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches. These estimations are crucial for understanding the timing and rate of evolutionary events.

3. **Fitness Estimation**: Tools for estimating the fitness of nodes within phylogenetic trees are available, including implementations of the Local Branching Index (LBI) method. These estimations provide insights into the evolutionary dynamics and relative success of different lineages.

4. **Parameter Estimation**: Functions are provided to estimate lineage tracing parameters, such as mutation rates and missing data rates, from phylogenetic trees and their associated character matrices. These parameters are vital for interpreting evolutionary histories accurately.

5. **Small-Parsimony Analysis**: The directory includes implementations of the Fitch-Hartigan algorithm for reconstructing ancestral states and scoring parsimony. These tools help infer the most-parsimonious set of states for a tree's nodes and calculate the number of state transitions.

6. **Topology Analysis**: Utilities for assessing the topological properties of phylogenetic trees are provided, including functions to compute expansion p-values for subclades and calculate cophenetic correlation. These analyses help evaluate the growth and balance of subclades within a tree.

Overall, the `cassiopeia/tools` directory equips researchers with a robust set of tools for conducting detailed phylogenetic analyses, enabling them to explore evolutionary relationships and dynamics comprehensively.
