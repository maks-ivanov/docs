## High-level description
The `compute_evolutionary_coupling` function calculates the evolutionary coupling between different categories of a given meta variable in a CassiopeiaTree. This coupling statistic, a Z-normalized mean distance between categories, reflects the phylogenetic relatedness of these categories within the tree.

## References
This function references the `compute_phylogenetic_weight_matrix`, `compute_inter_cluster_distances`, and `net_relatedness_index` functions from the `cassiopeia.data.utilities` module.

## Symbols
### `compute_evolutionary_coupling`
#### Description
This function calculates the evolutionary coupling between categories of a specified meta variable in a CassiopeiaTree. It first computes the phylogenetic weight matrix or uses a precomputed one. Then, it filters categories based on a minimum proportion threshold. It calculates inter-cluster distances between categories using a specified distance function (defaulting to Net Relatedness Index). To generate a null distribution, it shuffles the meta variable assignments and recomputes the inter-cluster distances multiple times. Finally, it calculates Z-scores for the observed inter-cluster distances based on the null distribution, representing the evolutionary coupling between categories.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tree | CassiopeiaTree | The CassiopeiaTree object containing the tree and meta data. |
| meta_variable | str | The name of the column in `tree.cell_meta` representing the categorical variable. |
| minimum_proportion | float | Minimum proportion of cells a category must appear in to be considered (default 0.05). |
| number_of_shuffles | int | Number of shuffles for generating the null distribution (default 500). |
| random_state | Optional[np.random.RandomState] | Numpy random state for shuffling (default None). |
| dissimilarity_map | Optional[pd.DataFrame] | Precomputed dissimilarity map between leaves (default None). |
| cluster_comparison_function | Callable | Function to compare mean distance between groups (default `net_relatedness_index`). |
| **comparison_kwargs |  | Additional arguments for the cluster comparison function. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Z_scores | pd.DataFrame | A K x K DataFrame containing the evolutionary coupling scores between K categories. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Compute/Retrieve Dissimilarity:** Calculate the phylogenetic weight matrix using `compute_phylogenetic_weight_matrix` if no `dissimilarity_map` is provided, otherwise use the provided map.
2. **Filter Categories:** If `minimum_proportion` is greater than 0, filter out categories with frequencies below the specified proportion.
3. **Calculate Inter-cluster Distances:** Compute the distances between categories using the `compute_inter_cluster_distances` function with the specified `cluster_comparison_function` and additional arguments.
4. **Generate Null Distribution:** Shuffle the meta variable assignments `number_of_shuffles` times and recompute inter-cluster distances for each shuffle, storing the results.
5. **Calculate Z-scores:** For each pair of categories, calculate the Z-score of the observed inter-cluster distance based on the mean and standard deviation of the corresponding distances in the null distribution.

#### Performance Considerations
The computational complexity is O(n^2 log n + (B+1)(K^2 * O(distance_function))), where n is the number of leaves, K is the number of categories, and B is the number of shuffles. Precomputing the dissimilarity map can significantly reduce runtime.
