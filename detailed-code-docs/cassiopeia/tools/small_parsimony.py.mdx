## High-level description
This file provides tools for analyzing phylogenies using small-parsimony. It includes functions for Fitch-Hartigan reconstruction, parsimony scoring, and the FitchCount algorithm. These tools are used to infer ancestral states and quantify transitions between states in a phylogenetic tree.

## Code Structure
The code consists of several functions that work together to perform small-parsimony analysis on a `CassiopeiaTree` object. The main functions are `fitch_hartigan`, `score_small_parsimony`, and `fitch_count`. `fitch_hartigan` is further divided into `fitch_hartigan_bottom_up` and `fitch_hartigan_top_down` for the two phases of the algorithm. `fitch_count` uses two helper functions, `_N_fitch_count` and `_C_fitch_count`, to implement the dynamic programming algorithm.

## References
This code references the `CassiopeiaTree` class from `cassiopeia.data` and several exception classes from `cassiopeia.mixins.errors`.

## Symbols

### `fitch_hartigan`
#### Description
Runs the full Fitch-Hartigan small parsimony algorithm to infer the most-parsimonious set of ancestral states for a given categorical variable in a `CassiopeiaTree`. It first performs the bottom-up phase to determine the optimal set of states for each node, and then the top-down phase to select a random solution that satisfies the maximum-parsimony criterion.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cassiopeia_tree | CassiopeiaTree | The tree object containing cell meta data. |
| meta_item | str | The name of the column in the cell meta data representing the categorical variable. |
| root | Optional[str] | The root node from which to start the refinement. If None, the tree's root is used. |
| state_key | str | The attribute key to store the ancestral states from the bottom-up phase. Defaults to "S1". |
| label_key | str | The attribute key to store the maximum-parsimony assignment from the top-down phase. Defaults to "label". |
| copy | bool | Whether to modify the tree in place or return a copy. Defaults to False. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cassiopeia_tree | Optional[CassiopeiaTree] | The modified tree object with inferred ancestral states, or a copy if `copy=True`. Returns None if `copy=False`. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Copies the tree if `copy=True`.
2. Runs `fitch_hartigan_bottom_up` to perform the bottom-up phase of the algorithm.
3. Runs `fitch_hartigan_top_down` to perform the top-down phase of the algorithm.
4. Returns the modified tree or a copy.

### `fitch_hartigan_bottom_up`
#### Description
Performs the bottom-up phase of the Fitch-Hartigan algorithm. It traverses the tree in post-order and infers the optimal set of ancestral states for each node based on the states of its children.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cassiopeia_tree | CassiopeiaTree | The tree object containing cell meta data. |
| meta_item | str | The name of the column in the cell meta data representing the categorical variable. |
| add_key | str | The attribute key to store the inferred ancestral states. Defaults to "S1". |
| copy | bool | Whether to modify the tree in place or return a copy. Defaults to False. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cassiopeia_tree | Optional[CassiopeiaTree] | The modified tree object with inferred ancestral states, or a copy if `copy=True`. Returns None if `copy=False`. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Copies the tree if `copy=True`.
2. For each node in the tree, traversed in post-order:
    - If the node is a leaf, its state is taken from the cell meta data.
    - If the node is internal, the intersection of the states of its children is taken as the optimal set of states. If the intersection is empty, the union of the states is taken.
3. Returns the modified tree or a copy.

### `fitch_hartigan_top_down`
#### Description
Performs the top-down phase of the Fitch-Hartigan algorithm. It traverses the tree from the root and selects a random solution from the optimal set of states for each node, ensuring consistency with the state assigned to its parent.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cassiopeia_tree | CassiopeiaTree | The tree object with ancestral states inferred from the bottom-up phase. |
| root | Optional[str] | The root node from which to start the refinement. If None, the tree's root is used. |
| state_key | str | The attribute key storing the ancestral states from the bottom-up phase. Defaults to "S1". |
| label_key | str | The attribute key to store the maximum-parsimony assignment. Defaults to "label". |
| copy | bool | Whether to modify the tree in place or return a copy. Defaults to False. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cassiopeia_tree | Optional[CassiopeiaTree] | The modified tree object with a maximum-parsimony assignment, or a copy if `copy=True`. Returns None if `copy=False`. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Copies the tree if `copy=True`.
2. For each node in the tree, traversed from the root:
    - If the node is the root, a random state is chosen from its optimal set of states.
    - If the node is not the root, the state assigned to its parent is checked. If the parent's state is in the node's optimal set of states, it is assigned to the node. Otherwise, a random state is chosen from the node's optimal set.
3. Returns the modified tree or a copy.

### `score_small_parsimony`
