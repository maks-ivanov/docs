## High-level description

The Cassiopeia project is a comprehensive software library designed for lineage tracing and phylogenetic analysis. It provides a suite of tools and modules to facilitate the reconstruction, analysis, and visualization of phylogenetic trees, which represent evolutionary relationships among species or genetic samples. The main components of the Cassiopeia library include:

- **Preprocessing**: Handles the transformation of raw sequencing data into a format suitable for phylogenetic analysis.
- **Solver**: Implements various algorithms for reconstructing phylogenetic trees from genetic data.
- **Plotting**: Provides utilities for visualizing phylogenetic trees in both 2D and 3D formats.
- **Data**: Manages phylogenetic tree structures and associated data, offering methods for tree manipulation and analysis.
- **Critique**: Offers tools for comparing phylogenetic trees, focusing on evaluating their similarity and accuracy.
- **Simulator**: Simulates phylogenetic trees and overlays data onto these trees for in silico experiments.
- **Tools**: Provides additional utilities for calculating metrics, estimating parameters, and performing statistical computations related to evolutionary biology.
- **Mixins**: Contains auxiliary functionalities such as error handling, logging, and utility functions.

## What does it do?

The Cassiopeia library is designed to support researchers in the field of evolutionary biology by providing a comprehensive framework for phylogenetic analysis. Here's how it works:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The library preprocesses raw sequencing data, handling tasks such as UMI collapsing, error correction, and sequence alignment. This ensures that the data is clean and ready for phylogenetic inference.

2. **Tree Reconstruction**: Using various solvers, the library reconstructs phylogenetic trees from genetic data. These solvers employ different algorithms, such as distance-based methods, greedy algorithms, and integer linear programming, to infer evolutionary relationships.

3. **Tree Visualization**: The library offers tools for visualizing phylogenetic trees in both 2D and 3D formats. Users can plot trees locally using Matplotlib and Plotly or upload them to the iTOL platform for enhanced visualization.

4. **Tree Comparison**: The critique module provides metrics for comparing phylogenetic trees, such as the Robinson-Foulds distance and triplet correctness, helping researchers assess the similarity and accuracy of different tree hypotheses.

5. **Simulation**: The simulator module generates phylogenetic trees and overlays data onto them, allowing researchers to conduct in silico experiments and evaluate tree reconstruction methods.

6. **Data Management**: The data module manages phylogenetic tree structures and associated data, offering methods for tree manipulation, ancestral character reconstruction, and dissimilarity computation.

7. **Statistical Analysis**: The tools module provides utilities for calculating phylogenetic metrics, estimating parameters, and performing small-parsimony analysis, enabling detailed exploration of evolutionary dynamics.

Overall, the Cassiopeia library automates and streamlines the process of phylogenetic analysis, providing researchers with a powerful toolkit for studying evolutionary relationships and dynamics.
