title: "codecov.yml"
---

## High-level description
The `codecov.yml` file is a configuration file for the Codecov service, which is used to measure and report code coverage in a software project. This file specifies the coverage status settings for both the entire project and individual patches, including targets and thresholds for acceptable coverage changes.

## Code Structure
The file is structured in a YAML format, which is a human-readable data serialization standard. It contains nested keys that define the configuration settings for the Codecov service. The main sections are `coverage`, `status`, `project`, and `patch`, each with their own sub-settings.

## Symbols

### `coverage`
#### Description
The `coverage` key is the top-level key in the configuration file, indicating that the settings pertain to code coverage metrics.

### `status`
#### Description
The `status` key under `coverage` specifies the conditions under which the coverage status is reported and evaluated.

### `project`
#### Description
The `project` key under `status` defines the coverage settings for the entire project. It includes a `default` sub-key that sets the target and threshold for project-wide coverage.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| target | string | Specifies the target coverage level, set to `auto` to automatically compare to the previous commit. |
| threshold | percentage | Allows a specified percentage drop in coverage from the previous base commit. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | This section does not produce outputs but configures how coverage is evaluated. |

#### Internal Logic
- The `target` is set to `auto`, meaning it will automatically compare the current coverage to the previous commit's coverage.
- The `threshold` is set to 5%, allowing a 5% drop in coverage from the previous base commit. This is a temporary setting that is expected to be tightened as testing improves.

### `patch`
#### Description
The `patch` key under `status` defines the coverage settings for individual patches or changes. It also includes a `default` sub-key with similar settings to the `project` key.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| target | string | Specifies the target coverage level, set to `auto` to automatically compare to the previous commit. |
| threshold | percentage | Allows a specified percentage drop in coverage from the previous base commit. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | This section does not produce outputs but configures how coverage is evaluated for patches. |

#### Internal Logic
- The `target` is set to `auto`, similar to the `project` settings.
- The `threshold` is set to 50%, allowing a 50% drop in coverage from the previous base commit for patches. This is also expected to be reduced as testing matures.

## Side Effects
There are no direct side effects from this configuration file itself, but it influences how Codecov reports coverage changes, potentially affecting build status or alerts in a CI/CD pipeline.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Codecov | This configuration file is specifically for the Codecov service, which integrates with CI/CD pipelines to report code coverage. |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| target | string | auto | Automatically compares coverage to the previous commit. |
| threshold | percentage | 5% (project), 50% (patch) | Allows a specified drop in coverage from the previous base commit. |

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this configuration file, as it is a static YAML file meant for setting parameters. Errors would typically arise from incorrect syntax or unsupported settings, which would be handled by the Codecov service.

## Logging
There is no logging mechanism within this configuration file itself. Any logging related to coverage would be handled by the Codecov service or the CI/CD pipeline it integrates with.

## TODOs
- The comments in the file indicate that the thresholds for both project and patch coverage drops are expected to be decreased as testing matures. This suggests a future update to the configuration to tighten coverage requirements.
