## High-level description
This YAML file configures Codecov, a code coverage reporting tool. It sets specific coverage requirements for the project and disables patch coverage checks.

## Symbols

### coverage
#### Description
The `coverage` key is the main configuration block for Codecov settings. It contains nested configurations for different aspects of coverage reporting.

### status
#### Description
The `status` key, nested under `coverage`, defines how Codecov should report the status of code coverage.

### project
#### Description
The `project` key, nested under `status`, configures settings for the overall project coverage.

### default
#### Description
The `default` key, nested under `project`, specifies the default coverage requirements for the project.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets a target coverage percentage of 85%
- Allows a threshold of 1% deviation from the target

### patch
#### Description
The `patch` key, nested under `status`, configures settings for patch coverage (coverage of changed lines in pull requests).

#### Internal Logic
- Set to `off`, which disables patch coverage checks

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| target | percentage | 85% | The desired code coverage percentage for the project |
| threshold | percentage | 1% | The allowed deviation from the target coverage |
| patch | string | off | Configuration for patch coverage checks |

## TODOs
The file includes a comment suggesting a method to validate the YAML configuration:
```
# Run to check if valid
# curl --data-binary @codecov.yml https://codecov.io/validate
```
This command can be used to ensure the YAML file is correctly formatted and valid according to Codecov's requirements.
