## High-level description
The `codecov.yml` file is a configuration file for the Codecov service, which is used to manage and report code coverage metrics for a project. This file specifies the coverage targets and thresholds that Codecov should use when analyzing the project's code coverage data.

## Code Structure
The file is structured in YAML format and contains a hierarchy of configuration options related to code coverage status checks. The main sections include `coverage`, `status`, `project`, and `patch`.

## Symbols

### `coverage`
#### Description
The `coverage` section is the top-level configuration block that defines the settings for code coverage analysis. It contains sub-sections that specify how Codecov should handle coverage status checks for the project.

### `status`
#### Description
The `status` section under `coverage` defines the criteria for passing or failing code coverage checks. It includes configurations for both project-wide and patch-specific coverage requirements.

### `project`
#### Description
The `project` section within `status` specifies the coverage targets and thresholds for the entire project. It includes a `default` sub-section that sets the baseline coverage expectations.

### `default`
#### Description
The `default` sub-section under `project` sets the default coverage target and threshold for the project. It specifies the minimum percentage of code that must be covered by tests for the project to be considered passing.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| target | percentage | The desired code coverage percentage for the project. |
| threshold | percentage | The allowable deviation from the target coverage percentage. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | This section does not produce outputs but sets configuration values. |

### `patch`
#### Description
The `patch` section under `status` is used to configure coverage requirements for new code changes (patches). In this configuration, it is set to `off`, meaning that Codecov will not enforce coverage checks on patches.

## Dependencies
The `codecov.yml` file is dependent on the Codecov service, which uses this configuration to determine how to process and report code coverage data for the project.

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Codecov | To manage and report code coverage metrics based on the configuration provided in this file. |

## Configuration
The file defines configuration options for code coverage analysis:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| target | percentage | 85% | The desired code coverage percentage for the project. |
| threshold | percentage | 1% | The allowable deviation from the target coverage percentage. |
| patch | boolean | off | Determines if coverage checks should be enforced on patches. |

## Error Handling
The file itself does not contain error handling mechanisms, but it can be validated using the provided curl command to ensure it is correctly formatted and valid for use with Codecov.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
