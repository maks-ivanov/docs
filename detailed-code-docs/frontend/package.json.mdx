title: "package.json"
---

## High-level description

The `package.json` file in the `frontend` directory is a configuration file for a JavaScript project, specifically for a frontend application. It defines the project's metadata, dependencies, scripts, and other configurations necessary for building, testing, and running the application. This file is crucial for managing the project's dependencies and automating common tasks through scripts.

## Code Structure

The `package.json` file is structured into several key sections:

- **Metadata**: Includes the project's name, version, main entry point, and license.
- **Dependencies**: Lists the libraries and packages required for the application to run.
- **Scripts**: Defines command-line scripts for building, testing, and other development tasks.
- **Peer Dependencies**: Specifies packages that are required by the project but should be installed by the consumer of the package.
- **Dev Dependencies**: Lists packages needed only for development and testing purposes.
- **Configuration**: Includes settings like `sideEffects`, `files`, and `packageManager`.

## Symbols

### Metadata
#### Description
Contains basic information about the project, such as its name, version, and license.

#### Fields
- `name`: The name of the package.
- `version`: The current version of the package.
- `main`: The main entry point of the application.
- `types`: The TypeScript declaration file.
- `type`: Specifies the module type (e.g., "module" for ES modules).
- `license`: The license under which the project is distributed.

### Dependencies
#### Description
Lists the packages required for the application to function. These are installed when the project is set up.

#### Fields
- Each entry is a package name with a version specifier, indicating the required version of the package.

### Scripts
#### Description
Defines a set of command-line scripts that can be run using a package manager like npm or pnpm.

#### Fields
- `preinstall`: Ensures that only `pnpm` is used as the package manager.
- `ci`: Runs a series of tasks for continuous integration.
- `start`, `dev`: Starts the development server using Vite.
- `build`, `build:watch`: Builds the project for production.
- `test`: Runs tests using Vitest.
- `typecheck`: Checks TypeScript types.
- `lint`: Runs linting tools.
- `storybook`, `build-storybook`: Runs and builds Storybook for UI component development.

### Peer Dependencies
#### Description
Specifies packages that are required by the project but are expected to be provided by the environment in which the project is used.

#### Fields
- `react`, `react-dom`: Specifies compatible versions of React and ReactDOM.

### Dev Dependencies
#### Description
Lists packages that are only needed during development and testing.

#### Fields
- Includes tools like `eslint`, `typescript`, `vite`, and various Storybook addons.

### Configuration
#### Description
Includes additional settings for the project.

#### Fields
- `sideEffects`: Specifies files that have side effects.
- `files`: Lists directories or files to include in the package.
- `packageManager`: Specifies the package manager and its version.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@codemirror/*` | Provides CodeMirror editor functionalities. |
| `@dnd-kit/*` | Used for drag-and-drop interactions. |
| `@emotion/*` | CSS-in-JS library for styling components. |
| `@radix-ui/*` | Provides accessible UI components. |
| `@storybook/*` | Tools for developing UI components in isolation. |
| `vite` | A build tool for modern web projects. |
| `vitest` | A testing framework for Vite projects. |

## Error Handling

The `package.json` file itself does not handle errors, but the scripts and dependencies it defines may include error handling mechanisms. For example, the `lint` script will fail if there are linting errors, and the `test` script will fail if tests do not pass.

## Logging

The `package.json` file does not directly implement logging, but tools like `vite` and `vitest` used in the scripts may provide logging output during their execution.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the `package.json` file.
