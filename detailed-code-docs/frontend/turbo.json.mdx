title: "turbo.json"
---

## High-level description
The `turbo.json` file is a configuration file for the Turbo build system, which is used to define and manage various tasks related to building, testing, and maintaining a frontend project. It specifies tasks such as building the project, type checking, testing, linting, and more, along with their respective configurations like outputs and environment variables.

## Code Structure
The configuration is structured as a JSON object with a top-level key `"tasks"`, which contains various task definitions. Each task is defined as a key-value pair where the key is the task name and the value is an object containing configuration details for that task.

## Symbols

### `build`
#### Description
The `build` task is responsible for compiling the project and generating the output files. It specifies the output directory and the environment variables required during the build process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| outputs | array | Specifies the directories or files that will be generated as a result of the build process. |
| env | array | Lists the environment variables that should be available during the build process. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dist/** | directory | The directory where the build artifacts are stored. |

### `typecheck`
#### Description
The `typecheck` task is used to perform type checking on the codebase, ensuring that the code adheres to the specified type definitions.

### `test`
#### Description
The `test` task is responsible for running the project's test suite to verify that the code behaves as expected.

### `lint`
#### Description
The `lint` task is used to analyze the code for potential errors, stylistic issues, and adherence to coding standards.

### `build-storybook`
#### Description
The `build-storybook` task is used to generate a static version of Storybook, a tool for developing UI components in isolation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| outputs | array | Specifies the directories or files that will be generated as a result of the Storybook build process. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| storybook-static/** | directory | The directory where the static Storybook files are stored. |

### `build:islands`
#### Description
The `build:islands` task is similar to the `build` task but includes additional environment variables. It is likely used for a specific build configuration related to "islands" in the project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| outputs | array | Specifies the directories or files that will be generated as a result of the build process. |
| env | array | Lists the environment variables that should be available during the build process. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dist/** | directory | The directory where the build artifacts are stored. |

### `dev`
#### Description
The `dev` task is configured for development purposes, allowing for a persistent development environment without caching.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cache | boolean | Indicates whether caching should be used during the development process. |
| persistent | boolean | Indicates whether the development environment should remain active persistently. |

## Dependencies
There are no external libraries or modules explicitly mentioned in this configuration file. However, it is implied that the Turbo build system is a dependency for interpreting and executing these tasks.

## Configuration
The configuration options are defined within each task as key-value pairs. The options include `outputs`, `env`, `cache`, and `persistent`, which are used to control the behavior of each task.

## Error Handling
The configuration file does not explicitly define error handling mechanisms. Error handling would typically be managed by the Turbo build system itself when executing these tasks.

## Logging
The configuration file does not specify any logging mechanisms. Logging would be handled by the Turbo build system or the individual tasks as they are executed.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
