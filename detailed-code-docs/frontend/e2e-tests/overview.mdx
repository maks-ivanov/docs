## High-level description

The `frontend/e2e-tests` directory is a comprehensive suite of end-to-end (E2E) tests for a frontend web application, utilizing the Playwright framework. These tests are designed to verify the functionality and stability of various UI components, interactions, and application states. The directory includes test scripts for buttons, UI components, grid layouts, application modes, output handling, session management, and more. Each test script is structured to automate browser interactions, ensuring that the application behaves as expected under different scenarios.

## What does it do?

The E2E tests in this directory simulate user interactions with the web application to ensure that all features work correctly. Here's a breakdown of the processes implemented:

- **Button and Component Interactions**: Tests verify that UI elements like buttons, checkboxes, and dropdowns render correctly and respond to user actions as expected.
  
- **Grid Layouts**: Tests ensure that grid layouts are displayed correctly, including verifying text positions and interactions with UI elements.

- **Application Modes**: Tests check the application's behavior in different modes, such as "edit" and "read" modes, ensuring that the correct UI elements are visible or hidden.

- **Output Handling**: Tests verify that the application can clear, append, and replace output correctly, ensuring dynamic content updates are handled properly.

- **Session Management**: Tests ensure that sessions can be resumed correctly, with input and output values persisting across sessions.

- **Kernel and Shutdown Processes**: Tests verify that the application handles kernel restarts and shutdowns correctly, including displaying appropriate messages and handling unsaved changes.

- **Standard Input and Streams**: Tests check that the application correctly processes user input and displays outputs from Python scripts, ensuring that standard output and error streams are redirected and displayed in the browser.

These tests are crucial for maintaining the application's quality and reliability, providing automated checks that catch regressions and ensure new features work as intended.
