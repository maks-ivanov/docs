## High-level description

The `kitchen_sink.py` file is an end-to-end test script for a frontend application using the Marimo framework. It demonstrates various UI components and functionalities, such as charts, forms, and interactive elements, by defining multiple cells that create and manipulate these components. The script is designed to test the integration and rendering of these components within a Marimo application.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the Marimo framework, which uses the concept of "cells" to define interactive components. Each cell is decorated with `@app.cell`, indicating that it is a reactive component within the Marimo application. The script uses various Marimo UI elements to create a comprehensive test suite for different UI functionalities.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which serves as the main application object for the Marimo framework. It is used to define and manage the lifecycle of the application and its components.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a reactive component within the Marimo application. Each function decorated with `@app.cell` represents a UI component or a piece of logic that can be rendered and interacted with in the application.

### `create_wrapper`
#### Description
`create_wrapper` is a utility function defined within one of the cells. It is used to wrap UI elements with additional metadata, such as a label, and to organize them within a vertical stack (`vstack`).

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| element | UIElement | The UI element to be wrapped. |
| key | str | A key or label for the wrapped element. |
| code | str | Optional code snippet associated with the element. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | UIElement | The wrapped UI element. |

### `office_characters`
#### Description
`office_characters` is a list of dictionaries representing characters from the TV show "The Office." It is used as sample data for UI components like tables.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| office_characters | list | A list of dictionaries with character data. |

### `altair_chart`
#### Description
`altair_chart` is a function that creates an Altair chart using the Marimo UI framework. It demonstrates the integration of Altair charts within a Marimo application.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| alt | module | The Altair module for creating charts. |
| vega_datasets | module | The Vega datasets module for sample data. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| chart | UIElement | The Altair chart UI element. |

## Side Effects

- The script modifies the global state of the Marimo application by defining multiple cells and UI components.
- It interacts with external libraries like Altair, Matplotlib, and Vega datasets to generate charts and visualizations.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | The main framework for building the application. |
| altair | Used for creating interactive charts. |
| vega_datasets | Provides sample datasets for charting. |
| matplotlib | Used for generating plots and visualizations. |
| numpy | Used for numerical operations and data generation. |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors beyond basic exception raising. It assumes that the Marimo framework and its components will manage any runtime errors.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms. It relies on the Marimo framework's internal logging for any necessary output or debugging information.

## TODOs

- There is a TODO comment indicating the use of an internal API for the progress bar, suggesting that this might need to be replaced with a public API in the future.
