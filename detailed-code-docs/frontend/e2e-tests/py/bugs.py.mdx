## High-level description

The target file `frontend/e2e-tests/py/bugs.py` is an end-to-end (e2e) test script designed to capture and document bugs that should not reappear in the application. It uses the `marimo` library to create a simple application with a series of cells that define the test logic. The script primarily focuses on setting up a user interface element and verifying its behavior.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the `marimo.App` class, which is used to define an application with multiple cells. Each cell is a function decorated with `@app.cell`, which allows the function to be executed as part of the application. The cells are executed in sequence, and they interact with each other by passing data between them.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to define and run the application. It serves as the main entry point for the e2e test.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a cell within the `marimo` application. Each cell can perform specific tasks, such as setting up UI elements or processing data.

### `__()`
#### Description
This is a series of unnamed functions (using the placeholder `__`) that are decorated with `@app.cell`. Each function represents a cell in the `marimo` application and performs specific tasks related to the e2e test.

#### Inputs and Outputs
- The first cell imports `marimo` as `mo` and returns it.
- The second cell takes `mo` as input, creates a UI number input element, and returns it as `bug_1`.
- The third cell takes `bug_1` as input and simply returns it.
- The fourth cell takes `bug_1` as input, accesses its `value` attribute, and returns nothing.

#### Internal Logic
- The first cell initializes the `marimo` module and displays a markdown message indicating the purpose of the test.
- The second cell creates a UI element for selecting a number between 1 and 10 and labels it as "bug 1".
- The third and fourth cells interact with the `bug_1` element, with the fourth cell specifically accessing its `value`.

## Side Effects

- The script modifies the UI by creating a number input element and displaying markdown text.
- It does not have any side effects on global state or external resources beyond the UI interactions.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Used to create and manage the application and UI elements. |

## Error Handling

The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It relies on the `marimo` framework to manage any errors that occur during the execution of the cells.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose any API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application for testing purposes.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
