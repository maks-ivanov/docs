## High-level description

The target file `frontend/e2e-tests/py/cells.py` is a simple script that uses the `marimo` library to define and run a basic application with two cells. Each cell is a function decorated with `@app.cell`, which allows the `marimo` framework to manage and execute them. The script primarily demonstrates the use of markdown rendering within these cells.

## Code Structure

The main components of the code are the `marimo.App` instance and the two cell functions defined using the `@app.cell` decorator. The `marimo` library is used to create an application and manage the execution of these cells. The cells are executed in sequence when the application is run.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class. It serves as the main application object that manages the lifecycle and execution of the cells defined within the script.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a cell within the `marimo` application. Each decorated function represents a cell that can perform specific tasks, such as rendering markdown or interacting with the user interface.

### `__()`
#### Description
This is the first cell function defined in the script. It imports the `marimo` library as `mo` and uses it to render a markdown header "Cell 1".

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The `marimo` module, imported as `mo`. |

#### Internal Logic
- Imports `marimo` as `mo`.
- Uses `mo.md()` to render a markdown header with the text "Cell 1".
- Returns the `mo` module.

### `__(mo)`
#### Description
This is the second cell function, which takes the `mo` module as an input and renders a markdown header "Cell 2".

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The `marimo` module, passed from the previous cell. |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `mo.md()` to render a markdown header with the text "Cell 2".
- Does not return any value.

## Side Effects

- The script modifies the application's state by rendering markdown content within the cells.
- The `app.run()` call at the end of the script starts the application, executing the defined cells.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Used to create and manage the application and its cells, as well as to render markdown content. |

## Error Handling

The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It relies on the `marimo` library to manage any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the cells.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose any API or public interface. It is a standalone script intended to be executed directly.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
