title: "streams.py"

## High-level description
The target file `streams.py` is a simple script designed to demonstrate the use of the `marimo` library for creating a basic application with cells. It includes functions that import the `os` module, print a message to the console, and execute shell commands to print messages to both standard output and standard error. The script is structured to run as a standalone application using the `marimo` framework.

## Code Structure
The code is structured around the `marimo.App` class, which is used to create an application instance. The application is composed of several cells, each defined by a function decorated with `@app.cell`. These cells perform specific tasks, such as importing modules, printing messages, and executing shell commands. The script is executed by calling `app.run()` when the file is run as a main program.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to manage the lifecycle and execution of the application. It serves as the main entry point for defining and running the application cells.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the `marimo` application. Each decorated function represents a cell that can perform a specific task or computation. The cells are executed in the order they are defined when the application is run.

### `__()`
#### Description
This function is a cell that imports the `os` module and returns it. It is used to make the `os` module available for other cells within the application.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| os | module | The imported `os` module. |

### `__()`
#### Description
This function is a cell that prints "Hello, python!" to the console. It serves as a simple demonstration of outputting text in a cell.

### `__(os)`
#### Description
This function is a cell that uses the `os` module to execute shell commands. It prints "Hello, stdout!" to the standard output and "Hello, stderr!" to the standard error.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| os | module | The `os` module used to execute shell commands. |

#### Internal Logic
- The function calls `os.system('echo Hello, stdout!')` to print a message to the standard output.
- It then calls `os.system('echo Hello, stderr! 1&gt;&2')` to redirect the message to the standard error.

## Side Effects
- The script prints messages to both the standard output and standard error, which can be observed in the console or terminal where the script is executed.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Used to create and manage the application and its cells. |
| os | Used to execute shell commands within a cell. |

## Error Handling
The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. Any errors that occur during the execution of shell commands or other operations will result in exceptions being raised by Python.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms. Output is directly printed to the console using `print` statements and shell commands.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose any API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
