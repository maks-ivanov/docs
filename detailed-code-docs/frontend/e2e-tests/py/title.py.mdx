## High-level description

The target file `title.py` is a simple script that uses the `marimo` library to create a basic application. It defines a single cell that displays a markdown header "Hello Marimo!" when executed. The script is designed to be run as a standalone application using the `marimo` framework.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the `marimo` library, which is used to create and run an application. The main components are the `App` instance and a single cell function that defines the content to be displayed. The `App` instance is responsible for managing the application's lifecycle, and the cell function is used to specify the content that the application will render.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class. It serves as the main application object that manages the lifecycle and execution of the application. It is used to define and run the application.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
The `app` object is instantiated from the `marimo.App` class. It is used to register cell functions and to run the application when the script is executed.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell function within the `marimo` application. This function specifies the content that will be rendered by the application.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The `marimo` module, which is imported and returned by the cell function. |

#### Internal Logic
The cell function imports the `marimo` module as `mo` and uses it to render a markdown header with the text "Hello Marimo!". The function then returns the `marimo` module.

### `if __name__ == "__main__":`
#### Description
This conditional block checks if the script is being run as the main program and, if so, executes the `app.run()` method to start the application.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
The `app.run()` method is called to start the application, which will execute the registered cell functions and render their content.

## References

The target file references the `marimo` library, which is crucial for understanding the code. The `marimo` library provides the `App` class and the `@app.cell` decorator used in the script.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Used to create and manage the application, define cell functions, and render content. |

## Error Handling

The code does not implement any specific error handling mechanisms beyond basic exception raising. It relies on the `marimo` library to handle any errors that may occur during the execution of the application.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms. It is a simple script intended to demonstrate the basic usage of the `marimo` library.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code. The script is complete and functional as a basic demonstration of the `marimo` library.
