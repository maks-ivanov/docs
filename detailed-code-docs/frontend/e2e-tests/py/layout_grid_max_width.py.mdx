## High-level description

The target file `layout_grid_max_width.py` is an end-to-end test script for a frontend application using the `marimo` framework. It defines a simple application layout with a grid structure, demonstrating the use of markdown rendering and a text input field. The script is designed to test the layout's maximum width handling and basic UI components.

## Code Structure

The script is structured around the `marimo` framework, which is used to define and run a simple application. The main components are defined using the `@app.cell` decorator, which indicates that each function represents a cell in the application layout. These cells are responsible for rendering markdown content and creating a text input field.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, initialized with a layout file `layouts/layout_grid_max_width.grid.json`. It serves as the main application object that manages the layout and execution of the defined cells.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| layout_file | str | Path to the layout configuration file. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| app | marimo.App | The application instance. |

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define functions that represent individual cells in the application layout. Each cell can render content or create UI components.

#### Internal Logic
- The first cell renders a markdown header "Grid Layout".
- The second cell renders a markdown message indicating a search operation.
- The third cell creates a text input field labeled "Search" and returns it.
- The fourth and fifth cells render simple markdown text ("text 1" and "text 2").
- The last cell imports the `marimo` module and returns it.

### `__generated_with`
#### Description
A metadata variable indicating the version of the tool used to generate the script, set to "0.1.50".

## References

- The `marimo` framework is used extensively for application and UI management.
- The layout file `layouts/layout_grid_max_width.grid.json` is referenced for configuring the application's grid layout.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Used for creating and managing the application layout and UI components. |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors. It relies on the `marimo` framework to manage any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the application.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose any API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application for testing purposes.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
