## High-level description
The target file `disabled_cells.py` is a simple script that uses the `marimo` library to define and run a minimal application with two cells. Each cell is a function decorated with `@app.cell`, which allows the `marimo` framework to manage and execute them. The cells primarily demonstrate the use of markdown rendering within the `marimo` application.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a `marimo.App` instance and two cell functions. The `App` instance is used to manage the lifecycle of the application, and the cell functions are decorated with `@app.cell`, indicating that they are part of the application's execution flow.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class. It serves as the main application object that manages the execution of the cell functions defined in the script.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a cell within the `marimo` application. Each decorated function is treated as a separate cell that can execute code and return results.

### `__()`
#### Description
The first cell function, `__()`, imports the `marimo` library as `mo` and uses it to render a markdown header "Cell 1". It returns the `mo` object for use in subsequent cells.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | None | This function does not take any inputs. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The `marimo` module, imported as `mo`. |

### `__(mo)`
#### Description
The second cell function, `__(mo)`, takes the `mo` object as an input and uses it to render another markdown header "Cell 2". It does not return any value.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The `marimo` module, imported as `mo`. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | None | This function does not return any outputs. |

## Side Effects
- The script renders markdown content using the `marimo` library, which may affect the application's UI or output display.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Used to create and manage the application, as well as to render markdown content. |

## Error Handling
The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It relies on the `marimo` framework to manage any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the cells.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose any API or public interface.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
