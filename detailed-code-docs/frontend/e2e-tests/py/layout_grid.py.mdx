## High-level description

The target file `layout_grid.py` is an end-to-end test script for a frontend application using the `marimo` framework. It defines a grid layout interface with several cells, each responsible for rendering different UI components or markdown content. The script is designed to be executed as a standalone application, showcasing the layout and functionality of a grid-based UI.

## Code Structure

The main structure of the code revolves around the `marimo.App` instance, which is configured with a layout file. The application is composed of several `@app.cell` decorated functions, each representing a cell in the grid layout. These cells are responsible for rendering markdown content or UI components, and they interact with each other through the `marimo` framework.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
The `app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, initialized with a layout file `layouts/layout_grid.grid.json`. It serves as the main application object that manages the grid layout and the execution of cell functions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| layout_file | str | The path to the layout configuration file. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| app | marimo.App | The application instance managing the grid layout. |

### `@app.cell` Decorated Functions
Each function decorated with `@app.cell` represents a cell in the grid layout. These functions are executed by the `marimo` framework to render content or UI components.

#### Description
These functions are responsible for rendering markdown content or UI components within the grid layout. They utilize the `mo` (marimo) object to interact with the UI and render content.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | marimo | The marimo object used for rendering content. |
| search | marimo.ui.text | (Optional) A UI text component for search input. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | varies | The output varies depending on the function, typically rendering content or returning UI components. |

#### Internal Logic
- The first cell function renders a markdown header "Grid Layout".
- The second cell function renders a markdown message indicating a search operation with the current search value.
- The third cell function creates a UI text input labeled "Search" and returns it.
- The fourth and fifth cell functions render simple markdown text "text 1" and "text 2", respectively.
- The last cell function imports the `marimo` module and returns it.

## Side Effects
- The script modifies the UI by rendering markdown content and UI components.
- It interacts with the `marimo` framework to manage the grid layout and cell execution.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Used for creating and managing the grid layout application and rendering UI components. |

## Error Handling
The script does not explicitly handle errors. It relies on the `marimo` framework to manage any exceptions that may occur during the execution of cell functions.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
