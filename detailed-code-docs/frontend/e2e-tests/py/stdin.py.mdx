## High-level description

The target file `stdin.py` is an end-to-end test script for a frontend application using the `marimo` framework. It defines a simple interactive application that prompts the user for their name and then displays a greeting message using Markdown formatting. The script is structured to run as a standalone application when executed.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the `marimo` framework, which is used to create and manage the application. The main components are the `app` object, which represents the application, and several `@app.cell` decorated functions that define the application's behavior. These functions are executed in sequence to perform the application's tasks.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which represents the application being created. It is used to define the application's behavior through decorated functions and to run the application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a cell in the `marimo` application. Each cell represents a unit of work or a step in the application's execution. The functions decorated with `@app.cell` are executed in the order they are defined.

### `__()`
#### Description
This is an anonymous function defined using the `@app.cell` decorator. It imports the `marimo` module and returns it as a tuple. This function is likely used to ensure that the `marimo` module is available for subsequent cells.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The `marimo` module |

### `__()`
#### Description
This function prompts the user for their name using the `input` function and returns the entered value. It is a simple interactive step in the application.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| value | str | The name entered by the user |

### `__(mo, value)`
#### Description
This function takes the `marimo` module and the user's name as inputs and uses the `marimo.md` function to display a greeting message in Markdown format. It does not return any value.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The `marimo` module |
| value | str | The name entered by the user |

## Side Effects

- The script prompts the user for input via the console.
- It displays a Markdown-formatted message using the `marimo` framework.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Used to create and manage the application, and to display Markdown content |

## Error Handling

The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It relies on the default behavior of Python's `input` function and the `marimo` framework.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose any API or public interface. It is designed to be run as a standalone application.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
