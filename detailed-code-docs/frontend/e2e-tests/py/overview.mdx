## High-level description

The `frontend/e2e-tests/py` directory contains a collection of end-to-end test scripts for a frontend application using the `marimo` framework. These scripts are designed to test various UI components, layouts, and functionalities by defining applications with multiple interactive elements. The main components of the directory include test scripts for buttons, bugs, cells, components, layouts, output manipulation, shutdown logic, standard input handling, and more. Each script is structured to run as a standalone application, showcasing different aspects of the `marimo` framework's capabilities.

## What does it do?

The scripts in this directory serve as automated tests for a frontend application, focusing on different UI elements and interactions. They demonstrate how to create and manage applications using the `marimo` framework, which allows for the definition of reactive components called "cells." Each script tests specific functionalities, such as:

- **Button Interactions**: Testing button click events and value changes.
- **Bug Verification**: Capturing and documenting bugs to ensure they do not reappear.
- **UI Components**: Constructing and displaying both basic and composite UI elements.
- **Layout Management**: Configuring grid layouts and testing their responsiveness and alignment.
- **Output Manipulation**: Demonstrating dynamic content updates through appending, replacing, and clearing operations.
- **Application Shutdown**: Implementing logic to stop the application based on user input.
- **Standard Input Handling**: Prompting users for input and displaying responses.
- **Stream Handling**: Executing shell commands and printing messages to standard output and error.

These scripts are essential for ensuring the frontend application's components and interactions function correctly and meet the desired specifications.

## Entry points

The directory contains multiple scripts, each serving as an entry point for specific test scenarios. The main files include:

- **`bad_button.py`**: Tests button interactions by incrementing a button's value upon clicks.
- **`bugs.py`**: Focuses on capturing and documenting bugs through UI interactions.
- **`cells.py`**: Demonstrates the use of markdown rendering within UI cells.
- **`components.py`**: Tests the construction and display of various UI components.
- **`layout_grid.py`**: Configures a grid layout to test UI component arrangement.
- **`output.py`**: Demonstrates output manipulation capabilities of the `marimo` framework.
- **`shutdown.py`**: Implements application shutdown logic based on form input.
- **`stdin.py`**: Handles standard input to prompt users and display responses.
- **`streams.py`**: Executes shell commands and prints messages to standard output and error.
- **`title.py`**: Displays a simple markdown header as a basic demonstration of the `marimo` framework.

Each script is organized to define an application using the `marimo` framework, with cells representing interactive components or logic steps. The data flow and control flow are managed by the `marimo` framework, which executes the cells in sequence.

## Key Files

### `layouts`
- **Purpose**: Contains JSON configuration files that define grid layouts for testing purposes.
- **Role**: Provides layout configurations that specify the structure and properties of grid layouts, such as column numbers, row heights, and cell positions.

## Dependencies

The scripts in this directory rely on the following external libraries:

- **`marimo`**: The primary framework used for creating and managing applications, UI components, and layouts. It provides the `App` class and `@app.cell` decorator for defining reactive components.
- **`altair`**: Used in `kitchen_sink.py` for creating interactive charts.
- **`vega_datasets`**: Provides sample datasets for charting in `kitchen_sink.py`.
- **`matplotlib`**: Used for generating plots and visualizations in `kitchen_sink.py`.
- **`numpy`**: Utilized for numerical operations and data generation in `kitchen_sink.py`.
- **`os`**: Used in `streams.py` to execute shell commands.

These dependencies are chosen for their capabilities in UI management, data visualization, and system interaction, which are essential for comprehensive end-to-end testing of the frontend application.
