## High-level description

The target file `bad_button.py` is an end-to-end test script for a frontend application using the `marimo` library. It defines a simple application with a single UI component, a button labeled "Bad button", which increments its value when clicked. The script is structured to run as a standalone application.

## Code Structure

The code is structured using the `marimo` library's `App` and `cell` decorators to define the application and its components. The main components are:
- The `App` instance, which serves as the application container.
- Several `cell` functions, which define the UI components and their behavior.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which serves as the main application container. It is used to define and run the application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a cell in the `marimo` application. Each cell can import modules, define UI components, or perform actions.

### `__()`
#### Description
There are multiple functions named `__` defined using the `@app.cell` decorator. Each function serves a specific purpose in the application setup.

#### Inputs
- The first `__` function imports the `marimo` module.
- The second `__` function takes `mo` (the imported `marimo` module) as input.
- The third `__` function takes `b` (the button component) as input.

#### Outputs
- The first `__` function returns the `marimo` module.
- The second `__` function returns the button component `b`.
- The third `__` function does not return any value.

#### Internal Logic
- The first `__` function imports the `marimo` module and returns it.
- The second `__` function creates a button using `mo.ui.button` with a label "Bad button" and an `on_click` event that increments the button's value. It returns the button.
- The third `__` function accesses the `value` property of the button `b` but does not perform any further actions.

## Side Effects

- The button's `on_click` event modifies its value by incrementing it each time the button is clicked.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Used to create and manage the UI components and application structure. |

## Error Handling

The code does not implement any specific error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the `marimo` library and its components function as expected.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The code does not expose any API or public interface. It is designed to be run as a standalone application.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
