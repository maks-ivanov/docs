## High-level description

The target file `components.py` is part of an end-to-end testing suite for a frontend application using the `marimo` library. It defines a series of UI components and interactions, allowing for the construction, display, and value retrieval of both basic and composite UI elements. The file is structured to facilitate testing of these UI components by dynamically generating and displaying them within a test application.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into several `@app.cell` decorated functions, each responsible for a specific aspect of the UI component lifecycle, such as defining UI elements, constructing them, displaying them, and retrieving their values. The `marimo` library is used extensively to create and manage these UI components.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which serves as the main application object for running the UI tests. It is used to define and manage the lifecycle of UI components through the `@app.cell` decorator.

### `@app.cell` Decorated Functions
Each function decorated with `@app.cell` represents a cell in the `marimo` application, which can define UI elements, perform operations, or return values.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The `marimo` module, used for creating UI components. |
| basic_ui_elements | dict | A dictionary of basic UI elements. |
| composite_elements | dict | A dictionary of composite UI elements. |
| selected_element | UI component | The currently selected UI component. |
| value | function | A function to retrieve the value of a UI component. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| selected_element | UI component | The constructed and displayed UI component. |
| composite_element | UI component | The constructed and displayed composite UI component. |
| basic_ui_elements | dict | A dictionary of basic UI elements. |
| file_area | function | A function to create a file area UI component. |
| file_button | function | A function to create a file button UI component. |

#### Internal Logic
- **UI Definition**: Functions define both basic and composite UI elements using `marimo`'s UI component methods.
- **Element Construction**: Elements are constructed based on their type, with specific logic for each UI component type.
- **Element Display**: Constructed elements are displayed using `marimo`'s layout functions like `hstack`.
- **Value Retrieval**: Functions retrieve and display the current value of UI components, handling different data types appropriately.

### `construct_element`
#### Description
A function that constructs a UI element based on the provided value, which corresponds to a specific UI component type.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses a series of conditional checks to determine the type of UI component to construct.
- Returns the constructed UI component based on the input value.

### `show_element`
#### Description
A function that displays a given UI element using a horizontal stack layout.

### `value`
#### Description
A function that retrieves and displays the current value of a UI component, formatting it as markdown.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Used for creating and managing UI components and application lifecycle. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors beyond basic conditional checks for element types. It assumes that the `marimo` library functions will handle any exceptions related to UI component creation and manipulation.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms. It primarily focuses on UI component creation and display.

## API/Interface Reference

The code does not expose an API or public interface. It is designed to be run as a standalone application for testing UI components.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code. The file appears to be complete and functional for its intended purpose.
