## High-level description

The directory contains JSON configuration files that define grid layouts for a frontend application, specifically used in end-to-end (e2e) testing. These configurations specify the structure and properties of grid layouts, including the number of columns, row height, and the positions of individual cells within the grid. The files are static and serve as input for systems that render these layouts during testing.

## What does it do?

The JSON files in this directory are used to configure grid layouts for testing purposes in a frontend application. They define how elements should be arranged in a grid format, specifying details such as the number of columns, the height of each row, and the position and span of each cell within the grid. These configurations help ensure that the layout behaves as expected under various conditions during automated testing.

For example, one configuration might define a grid with 12 columns and a row height of 40 pixels, with specific cells spanning multiple columns or rows. Another configuration might add properties like a maximum width for the grid or whether the grid should have borders. These configurations are crucial for testing the visual and functional aspects of the application's layout.

## Key Files

### `layout_grid.grid.json`
- **Purpose**: Defines a basic grid layout with 12 columns and a row height of 40 pixels. It includes an array of cell positions, each specifying the starting column, starting row, column span, and row span.
- **Role**: Serves as a simple grid configuration for testing the layout's responsiveness and alignment.

### `layout_grid_max_width.grid.json`
- **Purpose**: Extends the basic grid layout by adding properties such as maximum width (800 units) and a bordered option. It also defines cell positions similarly to the basic grid.
- **Role**: Provides a more complex grid configuration to test additional layout properties like maximum width and borders, ensuring the application handles these features correctly during testing.
