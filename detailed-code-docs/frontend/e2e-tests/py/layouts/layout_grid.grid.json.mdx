---

## High-level description
The JSON file defines a grid layout configuration for a frontend application, likely used in end-to-end (e2e) testing. It specifies the grid's structure, including the number of columns, the height of each row, and the positions of individual cells within the grid.

## Code Structure
The JSON structure is organized into a main object with two primary keys: `type` and `data`. The `type` key indicates the layout type, which is "grid" in this case. The `data` key contains the configuration details for the grid, including the number of columns, row height, and an array of cell positions.

## Symbols

### `type`
#### Description
Indicates the type of layout being defined. In this file, it is set to "grid", which suggests that the layout is organized in a grid format.

### `data`
#### Description
Contains the configuration details for the grid layout, including the number of columns, row height, and cell positions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| columns | integer | The number of columns in the grid layout. |
| rowHeight | integer | The height of each row in the grid, specified in pixels. |
| cells | array | An array of cell position objects, each defining the position and span of a cell within the grid. |

### `columns`
#### Description
Specifies the number of columns in the grid layout. In this configuration, the grid has 12 columns.

### `rowHeight`
#### Description
Defines the height of each row in the grid. The height is set to 40 pixels.

### `cells`
#### Description
An array of objects, each representing a cell in the grid. Each cell object contains a `position` key that defines the cell's position and span within the grid.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| position | array or null | An array of four integers representing the cell's starting column, starting row, column span, and row span. A value of `null` indicates an undefined position. |

#### Internal Logic
Each cell's position is defined by a four-element array:
- The first element is the starting column index.
- The second element is the starting row index.
- The third element is the number of columns the cell spans.
- The fourth element is the number of rows the cell spans.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |

| rowHeight | integer | 40 | The height of each row in the grid, in pixels. |
| cells | array | N/A | An array of cell position objects defining the grid layout. |
