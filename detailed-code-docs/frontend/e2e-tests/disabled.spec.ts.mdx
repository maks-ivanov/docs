title: "disabled.spec.ts"
---

## High-level description

The target file, `disabled.spec.ts`, is an end-to-end test script using Playwright to verify the behavior of a web application when dealing with "disabled cells" in a notebook-like interface. The test checks the visibility and status of cells, ensures that certain UI elements are not visible, and verifies the correct behavior when cells are disabled and re-enabled.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are interconnected as follows:
- The `test` function from Playwright is used to define test cases.
- Helper functions like `getAppUrl`, `resetFile`, `maybeRestartKernel`, and `takeScreenshot` are imported from other modules to assist in setting up the test environment and verifying test outcomes.
- The test case is structured with `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks to set up and clean up the test environment.

## References

- `getAppUrl` and `resetFile` from `playwright.config.ts` are used to configure the test environment.
- `maybeRestartKernel` and `takeScreenshot` from `helper.ts` are used to manage the test state and capture screenshots.

## Symbols

### `test.beforeEach`
#### Description
Sets up the test environment before each test case by navigating to the application URL and potentially reloading the page if the test is being retried.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| page | Page | The Playwright page object representing the browser page. |
| info | Object | Contains information about the test run, such as retry status. |

#### Outputs
None

### `test.afterEach`
#### Description
Cleans up the test environment after each test case by resetting the modified file to its original state.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

### `test("disabled cells")`
#### Description
Tests the behavior of the application when cells are disabled and re-enabled. It verifies the visibility of cell elements, the absence of add buttons, and the correct status of cells when they are disabled, modified, and re-enabled.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| page | Page | The Playwright page object representing the browser page. |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Navigates to the application URL and verifies the visibility of cell headers.
- Ensures that no "add cell" buttons are visible.
- Simulates user interactions to disable and enable cells, checking the status of cells after each action.
- Modifies the content of a cell and verifies that the status changes to "stale."
- Takes a screenshot of the final state of the page.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@playwright/test` | Provides the testing framework and utilities for browser automation. |
| `node:url` | Used to resolve the file path of the current module. |

## Error Handling

The test script relies on Playwright's built-in error handling mechanisms. If an expectation fails, Playwright will automatically report the error and retry the test if configured to do so.

## Logging

The script does not implement explicit logging but uses Playwright's built-in reporting and screenshot capabilities to capture the test state.

## TODOs

No TODOs are present in the code.
