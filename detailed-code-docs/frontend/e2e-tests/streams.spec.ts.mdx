title: "streams.spec.ts"
---

## High-level description

The target file `streams.spec.ts` is an end-to-end test script using Playwright to verify that the standard output (`stdout`) and standard error (`stderr`) from a Python script (`streams.py`) are correctly redirected and displayed in a web browser. The test ensures that specific text outputs from the Python script are visible on the webpage, indicating successful redirection of these streams.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are interconnected as follows:
- The `test` function from Playwright is used to define a test case.
- The `getAppUrl` function from the `playwright.config.ts` file is used to retrieve the URL for the `streams.py` application.
- The `expect` function from Playwright is used to assert conditions on the webpage, such as the page title and the presence of specific text.

## Symbols

### `test`
#### Description
Defines a test case using Playwright to verify that the `stdout` and `stderr` outputs from the `streams.py` script are visible in the browser.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| page | `Page` | Represents a single tab in a browser where the test actions are performed. |

#### Outputs
None directly, but the test will pass or fail based on the assertions.

#### Internal Logic
1. Navigates to the URL of the `streams.py` application using `page.goto(appUrl)`.
2. Asserts that the page title is "streams".
3. Checks that the text "streams.py" is present on the page.
4. Verifies that the text "Hello, python!", "Hello, stdout!", and "Hello, stderr!" are visible on the page, indicating that the Python script's outputs are correctly redirected to the browser.

## References

- **`getAppUrl`**: This function is imported from `playwright.config.ts` and is used to construct the URL for the `streams.py` application. It determines the server configuration and constructs the URL based on the application's settings.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@playwright/test` | Provides the testing framework and utilities for writing end-to-end tests. |

## Error Handling

The test script relies on Playwright's built-in error handling. If any of the assertions fail, Playwright will throw an error, causing the test to fail. There is no custom error handling implemented in this script.

## Logging

Playwright's default logging mechanisms are used. The script does not implement additional logging.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the target file. However, the related `playwright.config.ts` file contains a TODO about considering testing on Firefox, which is not directly relevant to the target file but may impact the broader testing strategy.
