## High-level description

The target file `kitchen-sink.spec.ts` is an end-to-end (E2E) test script using Playwright to automate browser interactions. It tests the functionality of a web application by navigating to a specific URL, taking screenshots, and exporting the page content as HTML and PNG files. The script is part of a suite of tests designed to ensure the application's features work as expected.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are interconnected as follows:
- The `test` function from Playwright is used to define test cases.
- The `getAppUrl` function retrieves the URL for the application being tested.
- Helper functions `takeScreenshot`, `exportAsHTMLAndTakeScreenshot`, and `exportAsPNG` are used to perform specific actions on the page, such as taking screenshots and exporting content.

## References

- `getAppUrl` from `playwright.config.ts` is used to obtain the URL for the application.
- Helper functions from `helper.ts` are used to perform actions like taking screenshots and exporting content.

## Symbols

### `test`
#### Description
The `test` function from Playwright is used to define and execute test cases. It provides a structured way to automate browser interactions and verify application behavior.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| page | Page | Represents a single tab or page in the browser. |

#### Outputs
None directly, but it performs actions and assertions on the page.

#### Internal Logic
- The first test navigates to the application URL, takes a screenshot, and exports the page as HTML.
- The second test, which is skipped, navigates to the application URL and exports the page as a PNG.

### `getAppUrl`
#### Description
Retrieves the URL for the specified application by looking up configuration details in `playwright.config.ts`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| app | ApplicationNames | The name of the application to get the URL for. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| url | string | The URL of the application. |

### `takeScreenshot`
#### Description
Takes a screenshot of the current page and saves it to a specified path.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| page | Page | The page to take a screenshot of. |
| filename | string | The filename to use for the screenshot. |

#### Outputs
None directly, but it saves a screenshot file.

#### Internal Logic
- Constructs a filename based on the test file name and a counter.
- Takes a full-page screenshot and saves it to the specified path.

### `exportAsHTMLAndTakeScreenshot`
#### Description
Exports the current page as an HTML file and takes a screenshot of the exported content.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| page | Page | The page to export and take a screenshot of. |

#### Outputs
None directly, but it saves an HTML file and a screenshot.

#### Internal Logic
- Waits for the page to be fully loaded.
- Initiates a download of the page as HTML.
- Opens the downloaded HTML in a new page and takes a screenshot.
- Optionally toggles code visibility and takes another screenshot.

### `exportAsPNG`
#### Description
Exports the current page as a PNG file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| page | Page | The page to export as PNG. |

#### Outputs
None directly, but it saves a PNG file.

#### Internal Logic
- Waits for the page to be fully loaded.
- Initiates a download of the page as PNG and saves it to a specified path.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@playwright/test` | Provides the testing framework and browser automation capabilities. |
| `node:url` | Used to handle and manipulate URL paths. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors beyond what Playwright provides. Playwright's built-in mechanisms will handle navigation and interaction errors, typically by failing the test and providing diagnostic information.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms. Playwright's default logging and reporting features are used to capture test results and errors.

## TODOs

No TODOs or notes are present in the code.
