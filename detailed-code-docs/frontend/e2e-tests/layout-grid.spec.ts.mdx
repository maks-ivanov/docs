## High-level description

The target file `layout-grid.spec.ts` is an end-to-end (E2E) test script using Playwright to verify the functionality of a grid layout in a web application. It includes tests for running the grid layout, running the grid layout with a maximum width, and editing the grid layout. The tests ensure that the layout behaves as expected, including verifying text positions and interactions with UI elements.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are interconnected as follows:
- The `test` function from Playwright is used to define test cases.
- The `expect` function is used for assertions within the tests.
- The `Page` object represents a browser page and is used to interact with the web application.
- Helper functions like `takeScreenshot` and `bbForText` are used to capture screenshots and verify bounding box positions, respectively.

## References

- `getAppUrl` from `playwright.config.ts` is used to construct URLs for the tests.
- `takeScreenshot` from `helper.ts` is used to capture screenshots during tests.

## Symbols

### `test("can run Grid layout")`
#### Description
This test verifies that the grid layout can be run and that specific UI elements behave as expected.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| page | Page | Represents the browser page used for the test. |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Navigates to the grid layout run URL.
- Waits for the page to render.
- Verifies the visibility of the "Grid Layout" text.
- Interacts with a search box and verifies the output.
- Checks the relative positions of two text elements.
- Takes a screenshot of the page.

### `test("can run Grid layout with max-width")`
#### Description
This test checks the grid layout functionality when a maximum width is applied.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| page | Page | Represents the browser page used for the test. |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Navigates to the grid layout max-width run URL.
- Waits for the page to render.
- Verifies the visibility of the "Grid Layout" text.
- Takes a screenshot of the page.

### `test("can edit Grid layout")`
#### Description
This test verifies the editing capabilities of the grid layout, including layout changes and element interactions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| page | Page | Represents the browser page used for the test. |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Navigates to the grid layout edit URL.
- Verifies the initial positions of text elements.
- Toggles a preview button and verifies layout changes.
- Interacts with a search box and verifies the output.
- Changes the layout to vertical and verifies the new positions.
- Takes a screenshot of the page.

### `expectValidBoundingBox`
#### Description
Asserts that a bounding box is valid by checking its properties.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| bb | BoundingBox \| null | The bounding box to validate. |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Checks that the bounding box is defined and its properties are greater than zero.

### `bbForText`
#### Description
Retrieves and validates the bounding box for a text element on the page.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| page | Page | Represents the browser page used for the test. |
| text | string | The text to locate on the page. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| bb | BoundingBox | The bounding box of the text element. |

#### Internal Logic
- Locates the text element on the page.
- Ensures the element is visible.
- Retrieves and validates the bounding box of the element.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@playwright/test` | Provides the testing framework and utilities for browser automation. |
| `node:url` | Used to handle file URLs. |

## Error Handling

The code uses assertions (`expect`) to handle errors by verifying conditions during the tests. If an assertion fails, the test will fail, providing feedback on what went wrong.

## Logging

The code does not implement explicit logging but uses Playwright's built-in mechanisms to report test results and failures.

## TODOs

No TODOs or notes are present in the code.
