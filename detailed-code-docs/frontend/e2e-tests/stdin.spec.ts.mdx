title: "stdin.spec.ts"
---

## High-level description

The target file `stdin.spec.ts` is an end-to-end test script using Playwright to verify the functionality of a web application that interacts with a Python script named `stdin.py`. The test checks if the application correctly prompts for user input, processes the input, and displays the expected output.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the Playwright `test` and `expect` functions, which are used to define and execute the test case. The `getAppUrl` function from the `playwright.config.ts` file is used to retrieve the URL of the application being tested.

## References

- `getAppUrl`: This function is imported from `playwright.config.ts` and is used to obtain the URL for the `stdin.py` application.

## Symbols

### `test("stdin works", async ({ page }) =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This is a Playwright test case that verifies the functionality of the `stdin.py` application. It checks the presence of specific text in the console, simulates user input, and verifies the application's response.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| page | `Page` | Represents a single tab or page in the browser where the test actions are performed. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | N/A | The function does not return a value but performs assertions to validate the application's behavior. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Navigate to Application**: The test navigates to the URL of the `stdin.py` application using `page.goto(appUrl)`.
2. **Verify Initial State**: It checks that the text "stdin.py" is present on the page to confirm the correct application is loaded.
3. **Check Console Prompt**: The test verifies that the console output area contains the text "what is your name?".
4. **Loading Indicator**: It expects a loading spinner to be visible, indicating the application is processing.
5. **Simulate User Input**: The test fills the console input with the text "marimo" and simulates pressing the Enter key.
6. **Verify Output**: It checks that the text "Hi, marimo" appears on the page, confirming the application processed the input correctly.
7. **Check Loading Indicator**: Finally, it verifies that the loading spinner is no longer visible, indicating the process is complete.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@playwright/test` | Provides the testing framework and utilities for writing and executing end-to-end tests. |

## Error Handling

The test uses Playwright's `expect` function to handle assertions. If any expectation fails, Playwright will throw an error, causing the test to fail. This is standard behavior for test assertions.

## Logging

The test does not implement any explicit logging mechanisms. However, Playwright provides detailed logs and traces when tests are executed, especially when configured to collect traces on retries.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
