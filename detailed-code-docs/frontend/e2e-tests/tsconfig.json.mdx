title: "tsconfig.json"
---

## High-level description
The `tsconfig.json` file is a configuration file for TypeScript, specifically for the end-to-end (e2e) tests in the frontend directory. It defines the compiler options and specifies which files should be included in the TypeScript compilation process. This configuration ensures that the TypeScript compiler enforces strict type-checking rules and other settings to maintain code quality and consistency.

## Code Structure
The `tsconfig.json` file is structured as a JSON object with two main properties: `compilerOptions` and `include`. The `compilerOptions` property contains various settings that dictate how the TypeScript compiler should behave, while the `include` property specifies the files to be included in the compilation.

### `compilerOptions`
#### Description
The `compilerOptions` object contains a set of key-value pairs that configure the behavior of the TypeScript compiler. These options control aspects such as module resolution, type-checking strictness, and compatibility with JavaScript features.

#### Internal Logic
- **lib**: Specifies the library files to be included in the compilation. Here, it includes `ES2022` and `DOM`, which provide modern ECMAScript features and browser DOM APIs.
- **noEmit**: Prevents the compiler from emitting JavaScript files, useful for type-checking only.
- **module**: Sets the module system to `ESNext`, which supports the latest ECMAScript module features.
- **moduleResolution**: Uses `node` module resolution strategy, which is common in Node.js environments.
- **types**: Includes type definitions for Node.js, allowing Node.js-specific globals and modules to be recognized.
- **esModuleInterop**: Enables interoperability between CommonJS and ES Modules.
- **forceConsistentCasingInFileNames**: Ensures consistent file name casing across the project.
- **strict**: Enables all strict type-checking options.
- **noImplicitAny**: Disallows variables with an implicit `any` type.
- **noImplicitThis**: Disallows `this` expressions with an implicit `any` type.
- **noUnusedLocals**: Reports errors on unused local variables.
- **noFallthroughCasesInSwitch**: Ensures that switch statements have no fallthrough cases.
- **noImplicitOverride**: Requires explicit `override` keyword for overridden methods.
- **useUnknownInCatchVariables**: Uses `unknown` type for catch clause variables instead of `any`.
- **skipLibCheck**: Skips type checking of declaration files, which can speed up the compilation process.

### `include`
#### Description
The `include` array specifies the files or patterns to be included in the TypeScript compilation. In this configuration, it includes all files in the directory with the pattern `*`.

## Dependencies
The configuration references the `@types/node` package, which provides type definitions for Node.js, allowing the TypeScript compiler to understand Node.js-specific APIs and globals.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| lib | array | - | Specifies the library files to include in the compilation. |
| noEmit | boolean | false | Prevents emitting JavaScript files. |
| module | string | CommonJS | Specifies the module code generation. |
| moduleResolution | string | Classic | Determines how modules are resolved. |
| types | array | - | Specifies type declaration files to be included. |
| esModuleInterop | boolean | false | Enables interoperability between CommonJS and ES Modules. |
| forceConsistentCasingInFileNames | boolean | false | Enforces consistent casing in file names. |
| strict | boolean | false | Enables all strict type-checking options. |
| noImplicitAny | boolean | false | Disallows implicit `any` types. |
| noImplicitThis | boolean | false | Disallows implicit `this` types. |
| noUnusedLocals | boolean | false | Reports errors on unused local variables. |
| noFallthroughCasesInSwitch | boolean | false | Ensures no fallthrough cases in switch statements. |
| noImplicitOverride | boolean | false | Requires `override` keyword for overridden methods. |
| useUnknownInCatchVariables | boolean | false | Uses `unknown` type for catch variables. |
| skipLibCheck | boolean | false | Skips type checking of declaration files. |

## Error Handling
The configuration itself does not handle errors but sets up the TypeScript compiler to catch potential issues in the code, such as type mismatches, unused variables, and incorrect module resolutions.

## Performance Considerations
The `skipLibCheck` option can improve compilation performance by skipping type checks for declaration files, which is beneficial in large projects with many dependencies. The `noEmit` option also speeds up the process by focusing solely on type-checking without generating output files.
