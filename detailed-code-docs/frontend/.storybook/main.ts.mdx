## High-level description
The target file is a configuration file for Storybook, specifically tailored for a React project using Vite as the build tool. It defines the setup for Storybook, including the paths to story files, the addons to be used, and specific framework options.

## Code Structure
The main symbol in this code is the `config` object, which is structured to include various configuration options for Storybook. This object is then exported as the default export of the module.

## Symbols

### `config`
#### Description
The `config` object is a configuration setup for Storybook, which is a tool for developing UI components in isolation for React applications. This configuration specifies where to find story files, which addons to include, and how to integrate with the React framework using Vite.

#### Inputs
This configuration does not take inputs in the traditional sense, as it is a static configuration object.

#### Outputs
| Name   | Type   | Description                                      |
|:-------|:-------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| config | object | The configuration object for Storybook setup.    |

#### Internal Logic
- **Stories**: Specifies the file paths where Storybook should look for story files. It includes files with extensions `.mdx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, and `.tsx` within the `src` directory.
- **Addons**: Lists the addons to be used with Storybook, enhancing its functionality with features like links, essentials, interactions, and styling.
- **Framework**: Configures Storybook to use the `@storybook/react-vite` framework, which is optimized for React projects using Vite.
- **Docs**: Configures documentation settings, enabling autodocs with a "tag" strategy and disabling docs mode.
