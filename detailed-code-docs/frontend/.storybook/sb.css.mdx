## High-level description

The target file `sb.css` is a CSS stylesheet used in a Storybook setup for a frontend project. It defines styles for Storybook documentation components, specifically targeting the layout and appearance of elements within the Storybook documentation interface. The styles make use of Tailwind CSS utility classes to apply consistent theming and spacing.

## Code Structure

The CSS file contains three main style rules:
1. `.sbdocs-content`: Applies a flexbox layout with a column direction and a gap between items.
2. `.sbdocs.sbdocs-wrapper`: Uses Tailwind CSS utility classes to set background and text colors.
3. `.sbdocs.sbdocs-wrapper h1`: Ensures that the text color of `h1` elements within the wrapper is set using Tailwind CSS, with an `!important` flag to override other styles.
