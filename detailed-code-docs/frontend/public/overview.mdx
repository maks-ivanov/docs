## High-level description

The `frontend/public` directory contains resources for a web application that leverages the Marimo framework, a reactive Python notebook environment. This directory includes a Marimo notebook script (`wasm-intro.py`), a static HTML error page (`invalid_kernel_id.html`), and a Web App Manifest file (`manifest.json`). These components collectively support the functionality of running interactive Python notebooks in the browser using WebAssembly (WASM), handling errors related to kernel IDs, and providing metadata for the web application to function like a native app.

## What does it do?

The `frontend/public` directory serves multiple purposes within a web application:

1. **Interactive Notebooks with WASM**: The `wasm-intro.py` file is a Marimo notebook script that demonstrates how to run Python notebooks entirely in the browser using WebAssembly. This allows users to interact with Python code and UI elements directly in their web browser without needing a server-side Python environment. The script showcases features like reactive execution, where changes to UI elements or variables automatically update dependent code cells.

2. **Error Handling**: The `invalid_kernel_id.html` file provides a static error page that informs users when an invalid kernel ID is encountered. This is useful in applications that rely on kernel-based computations, ensuring users are aware of issues related to kernel identification.

3. **Web App Metadata**: The `manifest.json` file is a Web App Manifest that provides metadata about the web application, such as its name, icons, and theme colors. This file is essential for enabling the web application to be installed on a user's device and to behave like a native app, offering a seamless user experience.

## Entry points

The main files in the `frontend/public` directory are:

- **`wasm-intro.py`**: This is the primary entry point for users interested in exploring the Marimo framework and its capabilities for running Python notebooks in the browser. It is structured around the `marimo.App` class and uses decorators to define reactive cells that contain Python code and UI elements.

- **`invalid_kernel_id.html`**: This file serves as an entry point for displaying error messages related to invalid kernel IDs. It is a static HTML page that is likely served when such an error condition is detected in the application.

- **`manifest.json`**: This file is not an entry point in the traditional sense but is crucial for configuring how the web application is presented and behaves when installed on a user's device. It is referenced by the HTML files to provide consistent app metadata.

## Dependencies

The directory relies on the following external resources:

- **Marimo**: The `marimo` library is used extensively in the `wasm-intro.py` file to create reactive Python notebooks with UI elements and markdown rendering. It enables the interactive features of the notebook, allowing users to engage with Python code directly in their browser.

- **External Resources for HTML**: The `invalid_kernel_id.html` file references external resources like `/favicon.ico`, `/apple-touch-icon.png`, and `/manifest.json` to provide icons and metadata for the web application.

## Configuration

The `manifest.json` file contains configuration options for the web application, including:

- **`short_name` and `name`**: Define the app's short and full names for display purposes.
- **`icons`**: Specify the icons used by the app, including their source, size, and type.
- **`start_url`**: Indicates the URL to open when the app is launched.
- **`display`**: Sets the preferred display mode for the app, such as `standalone`.
- **`theme_color` and `background_color`**: Define the theme and background colors for the app, affecting the appearance of the browser's UI and the splash screen.
