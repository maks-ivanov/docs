---

## High-level description
The `invalid_kernel_id.html` file is a simple HTML document that serves as a static error page. It is designed to inform users that an invalid kernel ID has been encountered, likely in the context of a web application that uses kernels for processing or computation.

## Code Structure
The HTML document is structured with a standard HTML5 template, including a head section for metadata and a body section for content. The head section contains metadata about the document, such as character set, viewport settings, and links to icons and a manifest file. The body section contains a single message indicating the error.

### HTML Document
#### Description
The HTML document is a static error page that displays a message indicating an "invalid kernel id." It is likely used in a web application to inform users when a kernel ID is not found or is incorrect.

#### Inputs
This HTML file does not take any inputs as it is a static document.

#### Outputs
The output is a rendered HTML page in a web browser displaying the message "invalid kernel id."

#### Internal Logic
There is no complex internal logic in this HTML file. It simply renders the static content defined within the HTML tags.

## References
The HTML file references several external resources:
- **Favicon**: A link to `/favicon.ico` for the browser tab icon.
- **Apple Touch Icon**: A link to `/apple-touch-icon.png` for iOS devices.
- **Manifest**: A link to `/manifest.json`, which is a JSON file that provides metadata for the web application, such as icons and theme colors.

## Dependencies
The HTML file depends on external resources for icons and the manifest file:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `/favicon.ico` | Used as the browser tab icon. |
| `/apple-touch-icon.png` | Used as the icon for iOS devices. |
| `/manifest.json` | Provides metadata for the web application, such as icons and theme colors. |

## Configuration
There are no configuration options defined within this HTML file itself. However, the linked `manifest.json` file contains configuration options for the web application, such as the app's name, icons, and theme color.

## Error Handling
This HTML file itself does not implement any error handling mechanisms. It is likely served as a response to an error condition (invalid kernel ID) detected elsewhere in the application.

## Logging
There are no logging mechanisms implemented in this HTML file.

## API/Interface Reference
This HTML file does not expose any API or interface. It is a static document intended for display in a web browser.
