## High-level description

The `wasm-intro.py` file is a Marimo notebook script that introduces users to the Marimo framework, which is a reactive Python notebook environment. This script demonstrates the use of WebAssembly (WASM) to run notebooks entirely in the browser, providing an interactive experience with UI elements and markdown content. It also explains the benefits and limitations of using WASM notebooks, and provides guidance on using Marimo's features, such as reactive execution, UI elements, and running notebooks as apps.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the `marimo.App` class, which is used to create a Marimo application. The application is composed of multiple cells, each defined using the `@app.cell` decorator. These cells contain Python code that is executed in a reactive manner, meaning that changes to variables or UI elements automatically trigger the execution of dependent cells. The cells use the `marimo` library to render markdown content, create UI elements, and manage the notebook's interactivity.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
The `app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object for the Marimo notebook. It manages the execution of cells and the overall notebook environment.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo notebook. Each cell can contain Python code that is executed in a reactive manner. The decorator can take optional parameters, such as `hide_code`, to control the visibility of the cell's code.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The `marimo` module, used for rendering markdown and creating UI elements. |
| slider | object | A UI slider element created using `marimo.ui.slider`. |
| icon | object | A UI dropdown element created using `marimo.ui.dropdown`. |
| repetitions | object | A UI slider element for selecting the number of repetitions. |
| changed | bool | A boolean variable indicating whether a change has occurred. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The `marimo` module, returned for further use in other cells. |
| slider | object | The slider UI element, returned for use in other cells. |
| icon | object | The dropdown UI element, returned for use in other cells. |
| repetitions | object | The slider UI element for repetitions, returned for use in other cells. |
| changed | bool | The boolean variable, returned for use in other cells. |

#### Internal Logic
- Cells use the `marimo` module to render markdown content and create UI elements.
- Reactive execution is demonstrated by showing how changes to variables or UI elements automatically trigger the execution of dependent cells.
- UI elements such as sliders and dropdowns are created using `marimo.ui` and are used to demonstrate interactivity.
- Markdown content is used to provide explanations and tips about using Marimo and WASM notebooks.

## References

- The `marimo` library is extensively used throughout the code to provide the functionality for rendering markdown, creating UI elements, and managing reactive execution.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Provides the framework for creating reactive Python notebooks with UI elements and markdown rendering. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors, as it primarily focuses on demonstrating the features of Marimo notebooks. Any errors that occur would likely be related to the execution of Python code within the cells.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms, as it is primarily focused on demonstrating the interactive features of Marimo notebooks.

## API/Interface Reference

The code does not expose an API or public interface, as it is intended to be run as a standalone Marimo notebook application.
