## High-level description

The `biome.json` file is a configuration file for a code formatting and linting tool, likely related to the BiomeJS ecosystem. It specifies various settings for code formatting, import organization, and linting rules, particularly for JavaScript files. The configuration aims to enforce consistent code style and quality across the project.

## Code Structure

The configuration is structured into several main sections:

- **Formatter**: Defines general formatting rules for the codebase, such as indentation style, line width, and files to ignore.
- **Organize Imports**: Specifies whether import statements should be organized.
- **Linter**: Configures linting rules, including enabling recommended rules.
- **JavaScript**: Provides specific formatting rules for JavaScript files, including JSX quote style and semicolon usage.

## Symbols

### Formatter
#### Description
The `formatter` section configures the general code formatting rules for the project. It includes settings for indentation, line endings, and file exclusions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| enabled | boolean | Whether the formatter is enabled. |
| formatWithErrors | boolean | Whether to format code even if there are errors. |
| indentStyle | string | The style of indentation, either "space" or "tab". |
| indentWidth | number | The number of spaces or tabs for indentation. |
| lineEnding | string | The type of line ending to use, e.g., "lf" for line feed. |
| lineWidth | number | The maximum line width before wrapping. |
| attributePosition | string | How attributes should be positioned, e.g., "auto". |
| ignore | array | List of files or directories to ignore during formatting. |

#### Outputs
This section does not produce direct outputs but affects how code is formatted.

### Organize Imports
#### Description
The `organizeImports` section specifies whether the tool should automatically organize import statements in the code.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| enabled | boolean | Whether import organization is enabled. |

#### Outputs
This section does not produce direct outputs but affects the organization of import statements.

### Linter
#### Description
The `linter` section configures the linting rules for the project, including enabling the linter and applying recommended rules.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| enabled | boolean | Whether the linter is enabled. |
| rules | object | Specific linting rules to apply, such as "recommended". |

#### Outputs
This section does not produce direct outputs but affects code quality by enforcing linting rules.

### JavaScript Formatter
#### Description
The `javascript.formatter` section provides specific formatting rules for JavaScript files, including JSX quote style, semicolon usage, and bracket spacing.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| jsxQuoteStyle | string | The quote style for JSX attributes, e.g., "double". |
| quoteProperties | string | How object properties should be quoted, e.g., "asNeeded". |
| trailingCommas | string | Whether to include trailing commas, e.g., "all". |
| semicolons | string | Whether to use semicolons, e.g., "always". |
| arrowParentheses | string | Whether to include parentheses in arrow functions, e.g., "always". |
| bracketSpacing | boolean | Whether to include spaces between brackets. |
| bracketSameLine | boolean | Whether to place closing brackets on the same line. |
| quoteStyle | string | The quote style for strings, e.g., "double". |
| attributePosition | string | How attributes should be positioned, e.g., "auto". |

#### Outputs
This section does not produce direct outputs but affects the formatting of JavaScript code.

## Dependencies

This configuration file does not explicitly list dependencies, but it is likely used by a tool within the BiomeJS ecosystem.

## Configuration

The file itself is a configuration file, and the options are detailed in the Symbols section above.

## Error Handling

The configuration does not include explicit error handling mechanisms, as it is a static JSON file meant for configuring a tool.

## Logging

There are no logging mechanisms implemented in this configuration file.

## API/Interface Reference

This file does not define an API or public interface. It is used internally by a formatting and linting tool.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
