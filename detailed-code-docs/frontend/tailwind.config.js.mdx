## High-level description

The `tailwind.config.js` file is a configuration file for Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. This file customizes the default Tailwind CSS settings to fit the specific design requirements of the project. It extends the default theme with custom colors, fonts, shadows, animations, and other design elements, and it also includes plugins to enhance the functionality of Tailwind CSS.

## Code Structure

The configuration is structured into several main sections:

1. **Dark Mode**: Specifies the dark mode strategy.
2. **Content**: Defines the paths to all template files in the project.
3. **Theme**: Customizes the default theme with additional design elements.
4. **Plugins**: Adds additional functionality through Tailwind CSS plugins.

## Symbols

- **Theme**: 
  - **Container**: Centers the container and sets padding and screen size for 2xl screens.
  - **Extend**: Adds custom design elements such as box shadows, max-width, padding, colors, font families, border radius, keyframes, animations, and grid templates.
  - **Typography**: Customizes typography settings, including font family and color inheritance.
- **Plugins**: 
  - Includes `tailwindcss-animate` and `@tailwindcss/typography` for additional animations and typography styles.
