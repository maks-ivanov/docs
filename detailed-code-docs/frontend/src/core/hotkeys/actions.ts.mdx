## High-level description

The target file, `actions.ts`, is part of a hotkey management system in a frontend application. It provides functionality to register and manage keyboard shortcuts (hotkeys) and their associated actions using the `jotai` state management library. The file defines a mechanism to store, retrieve, and update a map of hotkey actions and their corresponding callback functions.

## Code Structure

- **`registeredActionsAtom`**: An atom that holds a map of hotkey actions and their associated callback functions.
- **`useRegisteredActions`**: A hook that retrieves the current map of registered hotkey actions.
- **`useSetRegisteredAction`**: A hook that provides methods to register and unregister hotkey actions.

## Symbols

### `registeredActionsAtom`
#### Description
This is a `jotai` atom that stores a map of hotkey actions (`HotkeyAction`) and their corresponding callback functions. It is used to manage the state of registered keyboard shortcuts within the application.

#### Inputs
- None directly, but it is initialized with an empty object.

#### Outputs
- Returns a state atom that can be used to get or set the map of registered actions.

### `useRegisteredActions`
#### Description
A custom hook that returns the current state of the `registeredActionsAtom`, which is the map of registered hotkey actions and their callbacks.

#### Inputs
- None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| actions | `Partial&lt;Record&lt;HotkeyAction, (() =&gt; void) | undefined&gt;&gt;` | The current map of registered hotkey actions and their callbacks. |

### `useSetRegisteredAction`
#### Description
A custom hook that provides functions to register and unregister hotkey actions. It allows adding new hotkey-action pairs or removing existing ones from the `registeredActionsAtom`.

#### Inputs
- None directly, but it uses the `registeredActionsAtom` internally.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| registerAction | Function | Registers a new hotkey action with a callback. |
| unregisterAction | Function | Unregisters an existing hotkey action. |

#### Internal Logic
- **`registerAction`**: Takes a `HotkeyAction` and a callback function, and updates the `registeredActionsAtom` to include this new action-callback pair.
- **`unregisterAction`**: Takes a `HotkeyAction` and removes it from the `registeredActionsAtom`.

## References

- **`HotkeyAction`**: A type imported from `hotkeys.ts` that represents the possible hotkey actions.
- **`jotai`**: A state management library used to create and manage atoms.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `jotai` | Used for state management, specifically to create and manage atoms. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the provided hotkey actions and callbacks are valid and that the state updates will succeed.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in this code.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
