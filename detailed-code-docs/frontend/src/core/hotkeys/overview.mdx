## High-level description

The `frontend/src/core/hotkeys` directory is part of a frontend application that manages keyboard shortcuts, also known as hotkeys. This system allows users to perform actions quickly using keyboard combinations. The directory includes functionality for defining, parsing, and managing these hotkeys, as well as testing their correct implementation. The main components within this directory are:

- **`actions.ts`**: Manages the registration and state of hotkey actions using the `jotai` state management library.
- **`hotkeys.ts`**: Defines the structure and resolution of hotkeys, including platform-specific and user-defined overrides.
- **`shortcuts.ts`**: Provides utility functions for parsing keyboard shortcuts and determining the user's platform.
- **`__tests__`**: Contains unit tests for the `parseShortcut` function to ensure it correctly identifies keyboard shortcuts.

## What does it do?

The hotkey management system in this directory allows users to define and use keyboard shortcuts to perform specific actions within the application. Here's how it works:

1. **Defining Hotkeys**: Hotkeys are defined with specific key combinations that can vary based on the user's platform (e.g., macOS vs. Windows). These definitions are managed in `hotkeys.ts`.

2. **Platform Detection**: The system can detect the user's platform using the `isPlatformMac` function in `shortcuts.ts`. This allows the application to adjust hotkey behavior based on whether the user is on a Mac or another operating system.

3. **Parsing Shortcuts**: The `parseShortcut` function in `shortcuts.ts` takes a string representation of a keyboard shortcut and returns a function that can check if a given keyboard event matches the shortcut. This is crucial for determining when a user has pressed a specific hotkey.

4. **Managing Hotkey Actions**: The `actions.ts` file uses the `jotai` library to manage the state of registered hotkey actions. It provides hooks to register and unregister hotkey actions, allowing the application to dynamically update which actions are available based on user interaction or application state.

5. **Testing**: The `__tests__` directory contains unit tests for the `parseShortcut` function, ensuring that it correctly identifies valid shortcuts and rejects invalid ones. This is important for maintaining the reliability of the hotkey system.

Overall, this directory provides a comprehensive system for managing keyboard shortcuts, allowing users to interact with the application more efficiently through customizable and platform-aware hotkeys.
