## High-level description

The target file `types.ts` defines TypeScript types and interfaces related to datasets in a frontend application. It provides type definitions for qualified column names, column preview summaries, a map of column previews, and the overall state of datasets, which includes tables, expanded tables, expanded columns, and column previews.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are interconnected as follows:
- `QualifiedColumn` is a type alias for a string format representing a column in a table.
- `ColumnPreviewSummary` is an interface that describes statistical summaries of a column.
- `ColumnPreviewMap` is a type alias for a read-only map that associates qualified column names with their previews.
- `DatasetsState` is an interface that represents the state of datasets, including tables, expanded tables, expanded columns, and column previews.

## Symbols

### `QualifiedColumn`
#### Description
Represents a qualified column name in the format `table:column`.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| QualifiedColumn | string | A string representing a qualified column name in the format `table:column`. |

### `ColumnPreviewSummary`
#### Description
Describes a summary of a column's statistics, including optional fields for error messages, total count, null count, unique count, and various statistical measures like min, max, mean, median, standard deviation, and percentiles.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ColumnPreviewSummary | object | An object containing statistical summaries of a column. |

### `ColumnPreviewMap`
#### Description
A read-only map that associates `QualifiedColumn` names with `DataColumnPreview` objects, which provide previews of the data in those columns.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ColumnPreviewMap | ReadonlyMap | A map of qualified column names to their data previews. |

### `DatasetsState`
#### Description
Represents the state of datasets in the application, including the list of tables, sets of expanded tables and columns, and a map of column previews.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| DatasetsState | object | An object representing the state of datasets, including tables and their expanded states. |

## References

- `DataColumnPreview` and `DataTable` are imported from `../kernel/messages`, indicating that these types are defined elsewhere and are crucial for understanding the `ColumnPreviewMap` and `DatasetsState`.
- The `DatasetsState` interface is used in the `state.ts` file to manage the state of datasets, including actions to manipulate this state.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `../kernel/messages` | Provides type definitions for `DataColumnPreview` and `DataTable`, which are used in the dataset state and column preview map. |

## Error Handling

The `ColumnPreviewSummary` interface includes an optional `error` field, which can be used to capture and represent any errors encountered while summarizing a column's statistics. This allows for graceful handling of errors in the dataset's column preview functionality.
