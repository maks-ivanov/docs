## High-level description

The `frontend/src/core/datasets` directory is a part of the frontend codebase responsible for managing the state and types related to datasets within the application. It consists of two main files: `state.ts` and `types.ts`. The `state.ts` file handles the state management of datasets using the `jotai` library, providing actions and hooks for manipulating and accessing the state. The `types.ts` file defines TypeScript types and interfaces that describe the structure and properties of datasets, including columns and their previews.

## What does it do?

The code in this directory is designed to manage and represent datasets within a frontend application. It provides a structured way to handle datasets' state, including the ability to expand tables and columns, preview column data, and manage the overall dataset structure. The state management is facilitated by the `jotai` library, which allows components to subscribe to changes in the datasets' state and dispatch actions to update it. The types defined in `types.ts` ensure that the data structures used in the application are well-defined and consistent, enabling developers to work with datasets confidently and efficiently.

## Entry points

The main files in this directory are `state.ts` and `types.ts`. 

- `state.ts` is the entry point for managing the state of datasets. It defines the initial state, actions, and hooks for interacting with the datasets' state. The file uses `jotai` to create atoms and hooks that components can use to access and manipulate the state.

- `types.ts` provides the necessary TypeScript types and interfaces for datasets. It defines the structure of dataset-related entities, such as columns and their previews, ensuring type safety and consistency across the application.

## Key Files

- **`state.ts`**: This file is crucial for managing the state of datasets. It defines the initial state, actions, and hooks for accessing and manipulating the datasets' state. It uses the `jotai` library to create atoms and hooks, allowing components to subscribe to state changes and dispatch actions.

- **`types.ts`**: This file defines TypeScript types and interfaces related to datasets. It includes definitions for qualified column names, column preview summaries, and the overall state of datasets. These types ensure that the data structures used in the application are well-defined and consistent.

## Dependencies

- **`jotai`**: This library is used for state management, providing atoms and hooks for accessing and manipulating the state of datasets. It is chosen for its simplicity and efficiency in managing state in React applications.

- **`../kernel/messages`**: This module provides type definitions for `DataColumnPreview` and `DataTable`, which are used in the dataset state and column preview map. These types are essential for understanding the structure and properties of datasets within the application.
