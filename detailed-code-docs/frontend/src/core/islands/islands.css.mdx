## High-level description

The `islands.css` file is a CSS stylesheet that imports several other CSS files to apply consistent styling across a web application. It defines a single CSS class, `.marimo`, which applies background and text color styles using Tailwind CSS utility classes.

## Code Structure

The file primarily consists of import statements that bring in styles from other CSS files. These imported styles are likely used to provide a consistent look and feel across the application. The `.marimo` class is defined to apply specific background and text color styles.

## References

The file references several other CSS files:
- `common.css`
- `globals.css`
- `codehilite.css`
- `katex.min.css`
- `table.css`
- `md.css`

These files are imported to provide additional styles that are used throughout the application.

## Symbols

### `.marimo`
#### Description
The `.marimo` class is a CSS class that applies background and text color styles using Tailwind CSS utility classes. It is designed to style elements with a specific background and text color.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | The class is applied to HTML elements to style them. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | The class styles the HTML elements it is applied to. |

#### Internal Logic
The `.marimo` class uses the `@apply` directive from Tailwind CSS to apply the `bg-background` and `text-foreground` utility classes. This directive allows for the reuse of Tailwind's utility classes within custom CSS.

## Dependencies

The file imports several external CSS files, which are dependencies for providing additional styles:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `common.css` | Provides common styles used across the application. |
| `globals.css` | Contains global styles that apply to the entire application. |
| `codehilite.css` | Styles for syntax highlighting, likely used for code blocks. |
| `katex.min.css` | Styles for rendering mathematical expressions using KaTeX. |
| `table.css` | Styles for tables, ensuring they are responsive and visually consistent. |
| `md.css` | Styles for markdown content, ensuring proper formatting and appearance. |

## Side Effects

The `.marimo` class, when applied, will change the background and text color of the elements it is used on, based on the Tailwind CSS utility classes specified.

## Performance Considerations

The use of the `@apply` directive in Tailwind CSS can help reduce the size of the final CSS by reusing utility classes, which can improve performance by reducing the amount of CSS that needs to be downloaded and parsed by the browser.
