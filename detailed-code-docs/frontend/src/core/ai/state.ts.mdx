## High-level description

The target file, `state.ts`, is part of a frontend application that uses the Jotai library for state management. It defines two atoms: `aiCompletionCellAtom` and `includeOtherCellsAtom`. These atoms are used to manage the state related to AI completion features in the application, specifically for handling the state of a cell's AI completion and whether to include other cells' code in AI operations.

## Code Structure

The file defines two main symbols, both of which are Jotai atoms:
- `aiCompletionCellAtom`: Manages the state of AI completion for a specific cell.
- `includeOtherCellsAtom`: Manages a boolean state indicating whether other cells' code should be included in AI operations.

## Symbols

### `aiCompletionCellAtom`
#### Description
This atom holds the state related to AI completion for a specific cell. It stores an object containing a `cellId` and an optional `initialPrompt`, or it can be `null` if no AI completion is active.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cellId | `CellId` | The identifier of the cell for which AI completion is active. |
| initialPrompt | `string` (optional) | An optional initial prompt for the AI completion. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| state | `object` or `null` | The current state of AI completion for a cell, or `null` if inactive. |

### `includeOtherCellsAtom`
#### Description
This atom manages a boolean state that indicates whether the code from other cells should be included in AI operations. It defaults to `false`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | - | - |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| state | `boolean` | A boolean indicating whether to include other cells' code in AI operations. |

## References

- `CellId`: A type imported from `../cells/ids`, which is used to uniquely identify cells within the application.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `jotai` | Used for creating atoms to manage application state. |

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this file, as it primarily defines state atoms.

## Logging
There is no logging implemented in this file.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
