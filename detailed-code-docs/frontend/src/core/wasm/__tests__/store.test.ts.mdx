## High-level description

The target file `store.test.ts` contains unit tests for different implementations of the `FileStore` interface, which are used to manage file storage in various contexts. The tests verify the behavior of `localStorageFileStore`, `domElementFileStore`, and `CompositeFileStore` to ensure they correctly save and retrieve file contents.

## Code Structure

The code is structured into three main test suites, each corresponding to a different `FileStore` implementation. These test suites use the `vitest` testing framework to define and execute tests. The `localStorageFileStore` and `domElementFileStore` are tested for their ability to save and read file contents, while the `CompositeFileStore` is tested for its ability to aggregate multiple `FileStore` instances and manage file operations across them.

## References

The target file references the following symbols from the related file `store.ts`:

- `localStorageFileStore`
- `domElementFileStore`
- `CompositeFileStore`

These symbols are implementations of the `FileStore` interface, which defines methods for saving and reading file contents.

## Symbols

### `localStorageFileStore`
#### Description
Tests the `localStorageFileStore` to ensure it correctly saves and retrieves file contents using the browser's local storage.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| contents | string | The content to be saved and retrieved. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | string | The content retrieved from local storage. |

### `domElementFileStore`
#### Description
Tests the `domElementFileStore` to verify that it interacts with a DOM element to read file contents, but does not modify the element when saving.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| element | HTMLElement | The DOM element used to store and retrieve content. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | string | The content retrieved from the DOM element. |

### `CompositeFileStore`
#### Description
Tests the `CompositeFileStore` to ensure it correctly aggregates multiple `FileStore` instances, prioritizing the first non-null result when reading and calling all stores when saving.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| stores | FileStore[] | An array of `FileStore` instances to be aggregated. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | string | The first non-null content retrieved from the aggregated stores. |

#### Internal Logic
The `CompositeFileStore` iterates over its array of `FileStore` instances, calling `readFile` on each until it finds a non-null result. For `saveFile`, it calls the method on all stores, ensuring each one attempts to save the content.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| vitest | Used for defining and running unit tests. |

## Error Handling

The tests do not explicitly handle errors, as they rely on the `vitest` framework to report any assertion failures or exceptions that occur during test execution.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in the test file, as it focuses solely on verifying the functionality of the `FileStore` implementations through assertions.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
