title: "tracer.ts"
---

## High-level description

The target file, `tracer.ts`, is responsible for creating and exporting a `Tracer` instance, which is used for performance measurement and logging within the application. This instance is also attached to the global scope, allowing it to be accessed globally throughout the application.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in the code is the `Tracer` instance, which is imported from the `@/utils/tracer` module. This instance is then exported as `t` and attached to the global scope, making it accessible as `globalThis.t`.

## References

- The `Tracer` class is imported from `@/utils/tracer`, which provides the implementation of the tracing functionality.
- The `t` instance is used in other parts of the codebase, such as in `bootstrap.ts` and `worker.ts`, to measure the performance of various operations.

## Symbols

### `t`
#### Description
The `t` symbol is an instance of the `Tracer` class, which is used to measure and log the performance of code execution. It is created and exported for use throughout the application.

#### Inputs
No direct inputs are provided to `t` in this file, as it is simply an instance of the `Tracer` class.

#### Outputs
No direct outputs are produced by `t` in this file, as it serves as a utility for performance tracing.

## Side Effects

- The `t` instance is attached to the global scope using `(globalThis as any).t = t;`, which allows it to be accessed globally within the application.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@/utils/tracer` | Provides the `Tracer` class used for performance measurement and logging. |

## Error Handling

There is no explicit error handling in this file, as it primarily focuses on creating and exporting the `Tracer` instance.

## Logging

The `Tracer` class, from which `t` is instantiated, includes logging capabilities for spans, but this file itself does not implement any logging.

## API/Interface Reference

This file does not define an API or public interface directly, but it makes the `Tracer` instance available globally for use in performance tracing across the application.
