## High-level description

The `getMarimoWheel` function in the target file is responsible for generating a string that specifies the version of the Marimo package to be used. This string can be a URL for a local development version, a specific version string, or a general version requirement. The function is used in the context of setting up a WebAssembly (Wasm) environment where Python packages are installed using Pyodide.

## Code Structure

The `getMarimoWheel` function is a standalone utility function that is used by other parts of the codebase, specifically in the `bootstrap.ts` file, to determine the correct Marimo package version or URL to install in a Pyodide environment.

## References

- The `getMarimoWheel` function is referenced in the `bootstrap.ts` file, where it is used to determine the Marimo package version or URL for installation in the `installDevMarimoAndDeps` and `installMarimoAndDeps` methods.

## Symbols

### `getMarimoWheel`
#### Description
The `getMarimoWheel` function generates a string that specifies the version of the Marimo package to be used. It handles different scenarios based on the input version string, such as returning a local development URL, a specific version, or a general version requirement.

#### Inputs
| Name    | Type   | Description                        |
|:--------|:-------|:-----------------------------------|
| version | string | The version identifier for Marimo. |

#### Outputs
| Name   | Type   | Description                                      |
|:-------|:-------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| output | string | A string specifying the Marimo package version.  |

#### Internal Logic
- If the `version` is not provided, it defaults to returning `"marimo &gt;= 0.3.0"`.
- If the `version` is `"local"`, it constructs a URL pointing to a local development server using the environment variable `VITE_MARIMO_VERSION`.
- If the `version` is `"latest"`, it returns `"marimo"`, indicating the latest version should be used.
- For any other `version` string, it returns a specific version requirement in the format `"marimo==&lt;version&gt;"`.

## Dependencies

The function relies on the `import.meta.env.VITE_MARIMO_VERSION` environment variable to construct the URL for the local development version of the Marimo package.

## Error Handling

The function does not include explicit error handling. It assumes that the `version` input is a valid string and that the environment variable `VITE_MARIMO_VERSION` is correctly set when needed.

## Usage in Related Code

In the `bootstrap.ts` file, the `getMarimoWheel` function is used to determine the correct Marimo package version or URL to install in a Pyodide environment. This is part of the process of setting up a WebAssembly environment for running Python code, where the Marimo package and its dependencies are installed using the `micropip` package manager in Pyodide.
