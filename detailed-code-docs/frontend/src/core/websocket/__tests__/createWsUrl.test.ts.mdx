title: "createWsUrl.test.ts"
---

## High-level description
The target file contains unit tests for the `createWsUrl` function, which is responsible for generating WebSocket URLs based on the current document's base URI. The tests ensure that the function correctly constructs URLs with the appropriate WebSocket protocol (`ws` or `wss`) and appends the session ID as a query parameter.

## Code Structure
The code is structured using the `vitest` testing framework, with a `describe` block containing multiple `it` test cases. Each test case mocks the `document.baseURI` to simulate different scenarios and verifies that the `createWsUrl` function returns the expected WebSocket URL.

## References
- `createWsUrl`: The function being tested, imported from `../createWsUrl`.
- `KnownQueryParams`: An object containing known query parameter keys, imported from `@/core/constants`.

## Symbols

### `describe`
#### Description
The `describe` function is used to group related test cases for the `createWsUrl` function. It provides a context for the tests, making it easier to understand the purpose of the test suite.

### `it`
#### Description
The `it` function defines individual test cases within the `describe` block. Each test case checks a specific aspect of the `createWsUrl` function's behavior.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| description | string | A description of the test case. |
| testFunction | function | A function containing the test logic. |

### `createWsUrl`
#### Description
The `createWsUrl` function generates a WebSocket URL based on the current document's base URI and a provided session ID. It switches between `ws` and `wss` protocols depending on whether the base URI uses `http` or `https`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sessionId | string | The session ID to be included as a query parameter in the URL. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| url | string | The constructed WebSocket URL. |

## Side Effects
- The tests temporarily modify the `document.baseURI` property to simulate different base URIs.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `vitest` | Provides the testing framework for writing and executing tests. |

## Error Handling
The tests do not explicitly handle errors, as they rely on the `vitest` framework to catch and report any assertion failures.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented in the test code.

## TODOs
No TODOs or notes are present in the code.
