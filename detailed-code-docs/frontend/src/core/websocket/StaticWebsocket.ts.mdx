## High-level description

The `StaticWebsocket` class in the target file is a mock implementation of the `IReconnectingWebSocket` interface. It provides a static, non-functional WebSocket-like object that can be used in scenarios where a real WebSocket connection is not needed or desired. This class implements the necessary properties and methods to conform to the `IReconnectingWebSocket` interface but does not perform any actual network operations.

## Code Structure

The `StaticWebsocket` class implements the `IReconnectingWebSocket` interface, which is defined in the `types.ts` file. This interface is a type alias for the `ReconnectingWebSocket` class from the `partysocket/ws` library. The `StaticWebsocket` class provides no-operation (noop) implementations for the methods required by the interface, making it a placeholder or mock object.

## References

- `IReconnectingWebSocket`: An interface defined in `types.ts` that the `StaticWebsocket` class implements.
- `WebSocket`: The native WebSocket API, from which the `StaticWebsocket` class derives its state constants.

## Symbols

### `StaticWebsocket`
#### Description
The `StaticWebsocket` class is a mock implementation of the `IReconnectingWebSocket` interface. It provides a static WebSocket-like object with no operational functionality, serving as a placeholder for scenarios where a real WebSocket connection is not required.

#### Inputs
This class does not take any inputs directly as it is instantiated without parameters.

#### Outputs
This class does not produce any outputs as it does not perform any operations.

#### Internal Logic
The `StaticWebsocket` class defines several properties and methods to mimic the behavior of a WebSocket object:
- **Properties**: It includes WebSocket state constants (`CONNECTING`, `OPEN`, `CLOSING`, `CLOSED`), and other WebSocket properties like `binaryType`, `bufferedAmount`, `extensions`, `protocol`, and `url`.
- **Event Handlers**: It defines event handler properties (`onclose`, `onerror`, `onmessage`, `onopen`) initialized to `null`.
- **Methods**: It implements methods like `addEventListener`, `removeEventListener`, `dispatchEvent`, `reconnect`, `send`, and `close`, all of which are no-operations (noop).

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `partysocket/ws` | Provides the `ReconnectingWebSocket` class, which the `IReconnectingWebSocket` interface is based on. |

## Error Handling

The `StaticWebsocket` class does not implement any error handling as it does not perform any operations that could result in errors.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in the `StaticWebsocket` class.

## API/Interface Reference

The `StaticWebsocket` class implements the `IReconnectingWebSocket` interface, which is a type alias for the `ReconnectingWebSocket` class. This interface requires the implementation of WebSocket-like methods and properties, which `StaticWebsocket` provides as no-operations.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
