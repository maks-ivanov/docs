## High-level description

The target file `RuntimeState.test.ts` contains unit tests for the `RuntimeState` class, which is responsible for managing the lifecycle of event listeners related to UI elements in a frontend application. The tests ensure that the `RuntimeState` class correctly registers and deregisters event listeners for custom events, specifically the `MarimoValueReadyEvent`, and that it enforces a singleton pattern for its operation.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are interconnected as follows:
- `RuntimeState`: The class being tested, which manages event listeners for UI elements.
- `UIElementRegistry`: A singleton class that maintains the state of UI elements and is used by `RuntimeState`.
- `MarimoValueReadyEvent`: A custom event type that `RuntimeState` listens for.
- `RunRequests`: An interface defining the `sendComponentValues` function, which is mocked in the tests.

## References

- `RuntimeState`: The class under test, defined in `RuntimeState.ts`.
- `UIElementRegistry`: Referenced as a dependency for `RuntimeState`.
- `MarimoValueReadyEvent`: A custom event type used in the tests.
- `RunRequests`: Provides the type for the mocked function `sendComponentValues`.

## Symbols

### `describe("RuntimeState", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This is a test suite for the `RuntimeState` class, using the `vitest` testing framework. It contains multiple test cases to verify the behavior of the `RuntimeState` class.

### `beforeEach(() =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
A setup function that runs before each test case. It clears all mocks, initializes a mock function for `sendComponentValues`, and resets the `UIElementRegistry` singleton instance.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Clears all mock functions using `vi.clearAllMocks()`.
- Initializes `mockSendComponentValues` as a mock function that returns a resolved promise.
- Resets the `UIElementRegistry` by clearing its entries.
- Instantiates a new `RuntimeState` object with the `UIElementRegistry`.

### `test("start should register event listener", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
Tests that the `start` method of `RuntimeState` registers an event listener for the `MarimoValueReadyEvent`.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Calls `runtimeState.start(mockSendComponentValues)`.
- Asserts that `addEventListener` is called with the correct event type and a function.

### `test("it can only start once", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
Tests that the `start` method of `RuntimeState` can only be called once, ensuring idempotency.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Calls `runtimeState.start(mockSendComponentValues)` twice.
- Asserts that `addEventListener` is called only once.

### `test("stop should remove event listener", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
Tests that the `stop` method of `RuntimeState` removes the event listener for the `MarimoValueReadyEvent`.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Calls `runtimeState.start(mockSendComponentValues)`.
- Calls `runtimeState.stop()`.
- Asserts that `removeEventListener` is called with the correct event type and a function.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `vitest` | Used for testing, providing functions like `describe`, `test`, `expect`, and `vi` for mocking. |

## Error Handling

The tests do not explicitly handle errors, but they rely on the `vitest` framework to catch and report any exceptions or failed assertions during test execution.

## Logging

The `RuntimeState` class uses a `Logger` to warn if `start` or `stop` methods are called inappropriately, but this is not directly tested in the provided test cases.

## TODOs

No TODOs or notes are present in the code.
