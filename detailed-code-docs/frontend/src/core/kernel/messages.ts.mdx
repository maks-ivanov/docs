## High-level description

The `messages.ts` file in the `frontend/src/core/kernel` directory defines TypeScript types that represent various message schemas used in the Marimo application. These types are primarily used for communication between different parts of the application, such as the frontend and backend, or between different components within the frontend. The file imports schema definitions from the `@marimo-team/marimo-api` package and extends them to create specific message types used throughout the application.

## Code Structure

The file defines a series of TypeScript type aliases that map to specific schemas from the `@marimo-team/marimo-api` package. These types are used to ensure type safety and consistency when handling messages related to operations, data tables, errors, and other functionalities within the Marimo application.

## Symbols

### `schemas`
#### Description
Represents the `schemas` type imported from the `@marimo-team/marimo-api` package. It serves as a base type for other type definitions in this file.

### `DataType`
#### Description
Represents a specific data type schema from the `schemas` type. It is used to define the type of data being handled in various operations.

### `Banner`
#### Description
Defines a type for operation messages related to banners, using the `OperationMessageData` utility type with a specific operation type.

### `DataTableColumn`
#### Description
Represents a schema for a data table column, imported from the `schemas` type.

### `DataTable`
#### Description
Represents a schema for a data table, imported from the `schemas` type.

### `OutputChannel`
#### Description
Represents a schema for an output channel, imported from the `schemas` type.

### `MarimoError`
#### Description
Represents a schema for an error message, imported from the `schemas` type.

### `OutputMessage`
#### Description
Represents a schema for a cell output message, imported from the `schemas` type.

### `CompletionOption`
#### Description
Represents a schema for a completion option, imported from the `schemas` type.

### `CompletionResultMessage`
#### Description
Defines a type for operation messages related to completion results, using the `OperationMessageData` utility type with a specific operation type.

### `HumanReadableStatus`
#### Description
Represents a schema for a human-readable status, imported from the `schemas` type.

### `FunctionCallResultMessage`
#### Description
Defines a type for operation messages related to function call results, using the `OperationMessageData` utility type with a specific operation type.

### `PackageInstallationStatus`
#### Description
Represents a schema for package installation status, imported from the `schemas` type.

### `DataColumnPreview`
#### Description
Defines a type for operation messages related to data column previews, using the `OperationMessageData` utility type with a specific operation type.

### `OperationMessageType`
#### Description
Represents a schema for message operation types, imported from the `schemas` type.

### `OperationMessage`
#### Description
Defines a type for operation messages, which includes an operation type and associated data. It uses a mapped type to create a union of possible operation messages based on the `OperationMessageType`.

### `CellMessage`
#### Description
Defines a type for operation messages related to cell operations, using the `OperationMessageData` utility type with a specific operation type.

### `OperationMessageData&lt;T&gt;`
#### Description
A utility type that extracts and omits the `name` property from a specific operation message schema, based on the provided operation type `T`.

### `Capabilities`
#### Description
Defines a type for operation messages related to kernel capabilities, using the `OperationMessageData` utility type with a specific operation type.

## References

- The file references schemas from the `@marimo-team/marimo-api` package, which are used to define the various message types.
- The `OperationMessageData` utility type is used extensively to create specific message types by omitting the `name` property from the extracted schema.
