## High-level description

The `frontend/src/core/kernel` directory is a crucial part of a web application's frontend, responsible for managing the interaction between the user interface and the kernel. This directory includes modules for handling runtime states, managing session identifiers, manipulating URL query parameters, and defining message schemas for communication. It also contains unit tests to ensure the correct functionality of these components. The main components within this directory are:

- `RuntimeState.ts`: Manages the state of running cells and listens for UI events.
- `handlers.ts`: Handles kernel operations and UI interactions.
- `messages.ts`: Defines TypeScript types for message schemas used in the application.
- `queryParamHandlers.ts`: Provides functions for manipulating URL query parameters.
- `session.ts`: Manages session identifiers for user sessions.
- `__tests__`: Contains unit tests for the components in this directory.

## What does it do?

The code in this directory facilitates the communication and state management between the frontend UI and the backend kernel of a web application. Here's how it works:

1. **Runtime State Management**: The `RuntimeState` class listens for events from UI elements and updates the kernel with the values of these elements. It ensures that only one instance of itself exists and provides methods to start and stop listening for events.

2. **Kernel Operations**: The `handlers.ts` file includes functions to initialize the kernel, update UI elements, and manage cell operations. It ensures that the state of cells and UI elements is accurately reflected and updated based on kernel messages.

3. **Message Handling**: The `messages.ts` file defines TypeScript types for various message schemas used in the application. These types ensure type safety and consistency when handling messages related to operations, data tables, errors, and other functionalities.

4. **URL Query Parameter Manipulation**: The `queryParamHandlers.ts` file provides methods to append, set, delete, and clear query parameters in the URL. It updates the browser's history state to reflect these changes.

5. **Session Management**: The `session.ts` file manages session identifiers, generating, validating, and retrieving session IDs to track user sessions. It ensures session continuity across page reloads.

6. **Testing**: The `__tests__` directory contains unit tests for the components, verifying their behavior and ensuring they function correctly. These tests cover event management, URL query parameter manipulation, and session management.

## Entry points

The main files in this directory are organized to handle specific functionalities:

- `RuntimeState.ts`: Manages the lifecycle of running cells and event listeners.
- `handlers.ts`: Handles kernel operations and UI interactions.
- `messages.ts`: Defines message schemas for communication.
- `queryParamHandlers.ts`: Provides methods for URL query parameter manipulation.
- `session.ts`: Manages session identifiers.

These files work together to ensure smooth communication and state management between the frontend UI and the backend kernel, providing a seamless user experience.
