title: "filename.ts"
---

## High-level description

The target file, `filename.ts`, is responsible for managing the filename state within a React application using the Jotai state management library. It defines an atom to hold the filename, which is initially set by extracting it from the DOM, and provides a custom hook to access and manipulate this filename state.

## Code Structure

- `filenameAtom`: An atom created using Jotai to store the filename, which can be either a string or null. It is initialized with a value obtained from the DOM.
- `useFilename`: A custom hook that utilizes Jotai's `useAtom` to provide access to the `filenameAtom`, allowing components to read and update the filename state.

## References

- `getFilenameFromDOM`: A function imported from `../dom/htmlUtils` that retrieves the filename from the DOM, used to initialize the `filenameAtom`.

## Symbols

### `filenameAtom`
#### Description
`filenameAtom` is a Jotai atom that holds the state of the filename. It is initialized with a value obtained from the DOM using the `getFilenameFromDOM` function. This atom can be used throughout the application to maintain a consistent filename state.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| initialValue | `string \| null` | The initial value of the atom, derived from the DOM. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filenameAtom | `Atom&lt;string \| null&gt;` | A Jotai atom representing the filename state. |

### `useFilename`
#### Description
`useFilename` is a custom React hook that provides access to the `filenameAtom`. It returns a tuple containing the current filename and a setter function to update the filename. This hook allows components to easily read and modify the filename state.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filenameState | `[string \| null, (newValue: string \| null) =&gt; void]` | A tuple containing the current filename and a function to update it. |

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `jotai` | Used for state management, specifically to create and use atoms. |
| `../dom/htmlUtils` | Provides the `getFilenameFromDOM` function to initialize the filename state. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors. However, the `getFilenameFromDOM` function, which is used to initialize the `filenameAtom`, includes assertions to ensure that the necessary DOM elements are present. If these assertions fail, they will throw an error, which should be handled by the calling context.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
