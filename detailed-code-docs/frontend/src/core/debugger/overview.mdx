## High-level description
The target file defines a state management mechanism for a debugger in a frontend application using the Jotai library. It introduces a `DebuggerState` interface to represent the state of a debugger, which includes a `cellId` and an array of `OutputMessage` objects. The file exports a Jotai atom, `debuggerAtom`, which holds the state of the debugger and can be used to manage and react to changes in this state within the application.

## Code Structure
The main symbol in the code is the `debuggerAtom`, which is an atom from the Jotai library. It is used to manage the state of the debugger, which is defined by the `DebuggerState` interface. The `DebuggerState` interface includes a `cellId` and an array of `OutputMessage` objects, which are imported from another module.

## References
- `OutputMessage` is imported from `../kernel/messages`, which is a type representing the output messages related to a cell in the application.

## Symbols

### `DebuggerState`
#### Description
The `DebuggerState` interface defines the structure of the state managed by the `debuggerAtom`. It includes a `cellId` to identify a specific cell and an array of `OutputMessage` objects to store the outputs related to that cell.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cellId | string | Identifier for a specific cell. |
| outputs | OutputMessage[] | Array of output messages related to the cell. |

#### Outputs
This is an interface, so it does not produce outputs directly. It defines the shape of the data that the `debuggerAtom` will manage.

### `debuggerAtom`
#### Description
The `debuggerAtom` is a Jotai atom that holds the state of the debugger, which can be either a `DebuggerState` object or `undefined`. It is used to manage and react to changes in the debugger's state within the application.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| initialValue | DebuggerState \| undefined | The initial state of the debugger, set to `undefined`. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| state | DebuggerState \| undefined | The current state of the debugger. |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| jotai | Used for state management in the application. |

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on the Jotai library's built-in error handling for state management.

## Logging
The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The code does not define an API or public interface directly. It provides a state management mechanism that can be used within the application to manage the debugger's state.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
