## High-level description

The `constants.ts` file in the `frontend/src/core` directory defines a set of constants used throughout the application. These constants include URLs for GitHub pages and a collection of known query parameters that are used to manage various states and configurations within the application, such as session IDs, kiosk mode, and access tokens.

## Code Structure

The file exports two main objects: `Constants` and `KnownQueryParams`. The `Constants` object contains URLs related to the GitHub repository, while the `KnownQueryParams` object defines keys for query parameters that can be used in the application's URL to control its behavior.

## Symbols

### `Constants`
#### Description
The `Constants` object holds URLs for the GitHub page and the issues page of the Marimo project. These URLs are used in various parts of the application to direct users to the appropriate GitHub resources.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| githubPage | string | URL to the GitHub page of the Marimo project. |
| issuesPage | string | URL to the issues page of the Marimo project on GitHub. |

### `KnownQueryParams`
#### Description
The `KnownQueryParams` object defines a set of keys for query parameters that can be used in the application's URL. These parameters control various aspects of the application's behavior, such as whether code should be shown or hidden by default, session management, and mode settings.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| showCode | string | Parameter to determine if code should be shown by default in read mode. |
| includeCode | string | Parameter to determine if code should be hidden by default in read mode. |

## References

The `KnownQueryParams` object is referenced in several related files, such as `session.ts`, `auth.ts`, `vscode-bindings.ts`, and `createWsUrl.ts`, where it is used to manage URL query parameters for session management, authentication, and integration with VSCode.
