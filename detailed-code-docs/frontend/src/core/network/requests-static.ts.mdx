## High-level description

The `requests-static.ts` file defines a function `createStaticRequests` that returns an object implementing both `EditRequests` and `RunRequests` interfaces. This object provides methods for handling requests in a static notebook environment, where the notebook is not connected to a kernel, and thus, interactive elements are non-functional. The methods either log a message or throw an error to indicate that the requested operation is not supported in static mode.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in this file is the `createStaticRequests` function, which returns an object containing methods that either log a message or throw an error. The methods are categorized into two types: those that log a message and return `null`, and those that throw an error using the `throwNotInEditMode` function.

## Symbols

### `createStaticRequests`
#### Description
The `createStaticRequests` function creates and returns an object that implements the `EditRequests` and `RunRequests` interfaces. This object is used in a static notebook environment where the notebook is not connected to a kernel, and thus, interactive operations are not supported.

#### Inputs
This function does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | `EditRequests & RunRequests` | An object with methods for handling requests in a static notebook environment. |

#### Internal Logic
- The function defines a helper function `throwNotInEditMode` that throws an error indicating that the operation is not supported in static mode.
- It returns an object with methods:
  - `sendComponentValues`, `sendInstantiate`, and `sendFunctionRequest` log a message and display a toast notification indicating that the operation is not supported in static mode.
  - Other methods like `sendRestart`, `syncCellIds`, `sendRun`, etc., use `throwNotInEditMode` to throw an error, indicating that these operations are not supported.

## References

- **`toast`**: Imported from `@/components/ui/use-toast`, used to display notifications to the user.
- **`Logger`**: Imported from `@/utils/Logger`, used to log messages to the console.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@/components/ui/use-toast` | Provides the `toast` function to display notifications. |
| `@/utils/Logger` | Provides logging functionality to log messages to the console. |

## Error Handling

The `throwNotInEditMode` function is used to handle operations that are not supported in static mode by throwing an error. This ensures that any attempt to perform these operations results in a clear and immediate error.

## Logging

The `Logger` is used to log messages indicating that certain operations are not supported in static mode. This helps in debugging and understanding the flow of operations in a static notebook environment.
