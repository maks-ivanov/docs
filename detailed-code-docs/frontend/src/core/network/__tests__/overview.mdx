## High-level description

The target file contains unit tests for the `DeferredRequestRegistry` class, which is designed to manage deferred requests. The tests verify the functionality of creating, resolving, and handling failures of requests within the registry. The `DeferredRequestRegistry` is a utility that helps manage asynchronous operations, particularly useful in scenarios where requests are sent via HTTP and responses are awaited through a different channel, such as a WebSocket.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are interconnected as follows:
- `DeferredRequestRegistry`: The class being tested, which manages deferred requests.
- `RequestId`: A type and utility for generating unique request identifiers.
- `makeRequestMock`: A mock function used to simulate the behavior of making requests.
- `vi`: A testing utility from `vitest` used for mocking and assertions.

## References

- `DeferredRequestRegistry`: The class from the related file that is being tested.
- `RequestId`: A type and utility from the related file used for request identification.
- `generateUUID`: A mocked function from the `@/utils/uuid` module to generate unique identifiers.

## Symbols

### `describe`
#### Description
The `describe` function is used to group related tests for the `DeferredRequestRegistry` class. It provides a context for the tests, making it easier to understand the purpose of each test case.

### `beforeEach`
#### Description
The `beforeEach` function is a setup function that runs before each test case. It initializes the `makeRequestMock` and `registry` variables to ensure a clean state for each test.

### `it`
#### Description
The `it` function defines individual test cases within the `describe` block. Each test case checks a specific aspect of the `DeferredRequestRegistry` functionality.

#### Test Cases
1. **"should create and resolve new request"**: Tests that a new request can be created and resolved successfully.
2. **"should handle request failure"**: Tests that a request failure is handled correctly by rejecting the promise.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `vitest` | Provides testing utilities such as `describe`, `it`, `beforeEach`, and `expect`. |
| `@/utils/uuid` | Provides a utility function `generateUUID` for generating unique identifiers, which is mocked in the tests. |

## Error Handling

The tests include error handling by simulating a request failure using `makeRequestMock.mockRejectedValue(new Error("request error"))`. This ensures that the `DeferredRequestRegistry` correctly handles and propagates errors.

## Logging

No explicit logging mechanisms are implemented in the test code. The focus is on verifying the behavior of the `DeferredRequestRegistry` through assertions.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code. The tests are complete and focused on verifying the core functionalities of the `DeferredRequestRegistry`.
