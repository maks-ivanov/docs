## High-level description

The target file, `connection.ts`, is responsible for managing the connection status of a WebSocket connection in a frontend application. It uses the Jotai library to create an atom, `connectionAtom`, which holds the current state of the WebSocket connection. This atom is initialized with a default state of `CONNECTING`, indicating that the connection is in the process of being established.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in the code is the `connectionAtom`, which is an atom created using the Jotai library. This atom is used to store and manage the connection status of a WebSocket. The connection status is represented by the `ConnectionStatus` type, which is imported from the `../websocket/types` module. The initial state of the connection is set to `WebSocketState.CONNECTING`.

## References

- `ConnectionStatus` and `WebSocketState` are imported from `../websocket/types`. These are used to define the type and initial state of the `connectionAtom`.

## Symbols

### `connectionAtom`
#### Description
The `connectionAtom` is an atom created using the Jotai library to store the connection status of a WebSocket. It is initialized with a state of `CONNECTING`, indicating that the WebSocket is in the process of establishing a connection.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| state | `WebSocketState` | The current state of the WebSocket connection. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| connectionAtom | `Atom&lt;ConnectionStatus&gt;` | An atom representing the connection status of the WebSocket. |

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `jotai` | Used to create the atom for managing global state. |

## Error Handling

The target file does not implement any specific error handling mechanisms. However, the connection status managed by `connectionAtom` can be used in other parts of the application to handle different connection states and errors.

## Logging

The target file does not implement any logging mechanisms. However, the connection status can be used in other parts of the application to log connection-related events.

## API/Interface Reference

The target file does not expose any API or public interface directly. However, the `connectionAtom` can be used by other components in the application to access and modify the WebSocket connection status.

## Related Code Snippets

The related code snippets demonstrate how the `connectionAtom` is used in various parts of the application:

- In `useRestartKernel.tsx`, the `connectionAtom` is used to set the connection state to `CLOSING` before restarting the kernel.
- In `machine-stats.tsx`, the `connectionAtom` is used to determine the current connection state and display appropriate UI elements based on the state.
- In `useMarimoWebSocket.tsx`, the `connectionAtom` is used to track and update the WebSocket connection state as the connection opens, closes, or encounters errors.
