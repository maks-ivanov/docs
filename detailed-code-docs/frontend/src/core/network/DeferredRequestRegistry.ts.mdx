## High-level description

The `DeferredRequestRegistry` class in the `DeferredRequestRegistry.ts` file is designed to manage deferred requests in a client-server architecture. It facilitates sending requests via HTTP and awaiting responses through a WebSocket connection. The class uses a unique identifier for each request to track and resolve or reject promises based on the server's response.

## Code Structure

- **`RequestId`**: A type alias for a uniquely typed string used to identify requests.
- **`DeferredRequestRegistry`**: A generic class that manages a collection of deferred requests, allowing for asynchronous request handling and response resolution.

## References

- **`Deferred`**: A utility class used to create and manage promises, allowing for manual resolution or rejection.
- **`generateUUID`**: A utility function that generates a unique identifier, used to create `RequestId`.
- **`TypedString`**: A utility type that provides compile-time type safety for strings.

## Symbols

### `RequestId`
#### Description
`RequestId` is a type alias for a `TypedString` with the type `"RequestId"`. It is used to uniquely identify requests within the `DeferredRequestRegistry`.

### `DeferredRequestRegistry`
#### Description
The `DeferredRequestRegistry` class manages deferred requests by storing them in a map with unique identifiers. It provides methods to send requests, and resolve or reject them based on responses received from a server.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| operation | string | A string representing the operation associated with the requests. |
| makeRequest | function | A function that sends the request, taking a `RequestId` and request data as parameters. |
| opts | object | Optional settings, including a function to resolve existing requests with an empty response. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| promise | Promise&lt;RES&gt; | A promise that resolves or rejects based on the server's response. |

#### Internal Logic
- **Constructor**: Initializes the registry with an operation name, a request-making function, and optional settings.
- **`request` Method**: 
  - Clears existing requests if `resolveExistingRequests` is provided.
  - Generates a new `RequestId` and creates a `Deferred` object.
  - Sends the request using `makeRequest` and handles any errors by rejecting the promise.
- **`resolve` Method**: Resolves the promise associated with a given `RequestId` and removes it from the registry.
- **`reject` Method**: Rejects the promise associated with a given `RequestId` and removes it from the registry.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the internal state of the `requests` map by adding, resolving, or rejecting entries.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `Deferred` | Manages the promise lifecycle for requests. |
| `generateUUID` | Generates unique identifiers for requests. |
| `TypedString` | Provides type safety for request identifiers. |

## Error Handling
- Errors during the request process are caught and used to reject the associated promise, ensuring that the caller is informed of the failure.

## Logging
- The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## TODOs
- There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
