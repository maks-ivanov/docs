## High-level description

The `types.ts` file in the `frontend/src/core/network` directory defines TypeScript types and interfaces that represent various request and response schemas used in the network communication between the frontend and backend of the application. These types are primarily derived from the API schemas provided by the `@marimo-team/marimo-api` package. The file also includes interfaces for handling requests in different modes, such as run and edit modes, which are used to interact with the backend services.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are TypeScript type aliases and interfaces that map to the schemas defined in the `@marimo-team/marimo-api` package. These symbols are used to ensure type safety and consistency when making network requests and handling responses. The file imports types from the `@marimo-team/marimo-api` package and re-exports them as TypeScript types for use throughout the frontend codebase.

## Error Handling

The types in this file do not implement error handling directly, as they are primarily used for type safety and validation in network requests and responses. Error handling would typically be implemented in the functions or components that utilize these types.
