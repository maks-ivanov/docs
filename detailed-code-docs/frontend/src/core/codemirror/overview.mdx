## High-level description

The `frontend/src/core/codemirror` directory is a comprehensive module within a frontend codebase that integrates the CodeMirror library to provide a rich text editing experience. It includes a variety of components and utilities that enhance the functionality of the CodeMirror editor, such as syntax highlighting, code completion, keymap configurations, language support, and more. The directory is organized into several subdirectories and files, each focusing on specific aspects of the editor's functionality, including testing, cell management, drag-and-drop, editing commands, language support, markdown editing, placeholders, and more.

## What does it do?

The code in this directory collectively enhances a text editor by providing a wide range of features:

1. **Code Completion and Tooltips**: The `completion` subdirectory manages the lifecycle of autocomplete requests, converting server-sent completion messages into a format that CodeMirror can use to display suggestions and tooltips.

2. **Cell Management**: The `cells` subdirectory provides extensions for cell movement and code editing within a notebook-like environment, allowing users to run, delete, move, and edit cells efficiently.

3. **Editor Setup and Configuration**: The `cm.ts` file sets up the CodeMirror editor with various extensions and configurations, including syntax highlighting, code completion, and custom keymaps.

4. **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**: The `dnd` subdirectory implements a drag-and-drop extension, allowing users to drag text into the editor and insert it at the correct position.

5. **Editing Commands and State Management**: The `editing` subdirectory provides mechanisms to apply commands across multiple editor instances and manage the editor's state using compartments.

6. **Language Support**: The `language` subdirectory focuses on integrating and managing different programming languages within the editor, providing language adapters for Python, Markdown, and SQL.

7. **Markdown Editing**: The `markdown` subdirectory enables users to format text in a Markdown editor by providing commands to insert or toggle Markdown syntax elements.

8. **Placeholders**: The `placeholder` file defines extensions for smart and clickable placeholders, enhancing the editor's functionality with auto-completion and custom actions.

9. **React Integration**: The `react-dom` file provides a mechanism to integrate React components into the CodeMirror editor as panels, allowing for dynamic UI elements.

10. **Keymap Configuration**: The `keymaps` subdirectory manages and configures keymaps for CodeMirror editor instances, allowing users to switch between different keymap presets, such as "default" and "vim".

11. **Go-to-Definition Feature**: The `go-to-definition` subdirectory enhances code navigation by allowing users to quickly navigate to the definition of variables.

12. **Find-and-Replace Functionality**: The `find-replace` subdirectory implements a comprehensive find-and-replace feature, allowing users to search, replace, and highlight text within multiple editor views.

13. **Code Formatting**: The `format.ts` file provides functionality to format code within editor views by sending the code to a server for formatting and updating the views with the formatted code.

14. **Utilities**: The `utils.ts` file provides utility functions for working with the CodeMirror editor, focusing on cursor position and Vim mode detection.

Overall, this directory provides a robust and flexible framework for building a sophisticated code editor with advanced features, catering to both standard and Vim users, and supporting multiple programming languages.
