## High-level description

The target file, `extension.ts`, is part of a frontend codebase that configures extensions for the CodeMirror editor. It defines several state facets using CodeMirror's `Facet` API to manage configurations related to code completion, hotkeys, placeholders, and movement callbacks. These facets are used to customize the behavior and appearance of the CodeMirror editor in a modular and extensible way.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are facets, which are used to define and manage state in the CodeMirror editor. Each facet corresponds to a specific configuration or feature, such as code completion, hotkeys, placeholders, or movement callbacks. These facets are defined using the `Facet.define` method, which allows them to be combined and accessed throughout the editor's lifecycle.

## Symbols

### `completionConfigState`
#### Description
This facet manages the state related to code completion configuration. It is used to store and retrieve the `CompletionConfig` object, which defines how code completion should behave in the editor.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| values | `CompletionConfig[]` | An array of `CompletionConfig` objects. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | `CompletionConfig` | The first `CompletionConfig` object from the input array. |

#### Internal Logic
The facet combines multiple `CompletionConfig` values by selecting the first one in the array.

### `hotkeysProviderState`
#### Description
This facet manages the state related to hotkey configurations. It stores and retrieves the `HotkeyProvider` object, which defines the hotkeys available in the editor.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| values | `HotkeyProvider[]` | An array of `HotkeyProvider` objects. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | `HotkeyProvider` | The first `HotkeyProvider` object from the input array. |

#### Internal Logic
The facet combines multiple `HotkeyProvider` values by selecting the first one in the array.

### `placeholderState`
#### Description
This facet manages the state related to placeholder types in the editor. It stores and retrieves a `PlaceholderType`, which determines the type of placeholder to display.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| values | `PlaceholderType[]` | An array of `PlaceholderType` values. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | `PlaceholderType` | The first `PlaceholderType` value from the input array. |

#### Internal Logic
The facet combines multiple `PlaceholderType` values by selecting the first one in the array.

### `movementCallbacksState`
#### Description
This facet manages the state related to movement callbacks in the editor. It stores and retrieves a `MovementCallbacks` object, which defines various callback functions for cell movement and manipulation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| values | `MovementCallbacks[]` | An array of `MovementCallbacks` objects. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | `MovementCallbacks` | The first `MovementCallbacks` object from the input array. |

#### Internal Logic
The facet combines multiple `MovementCallbacks` values by selecting the first one in the array.

## References

- `CompletionConfig` from `config-schema.ts`: Defines the configuration for code completion.
- `HotkeyProvider` from `hotkeys.ts`: Manages hotkey configurations.
- `MovementCallbacks` from `extensions.ts`: Provides callback functions for cell movement.
- `Facet` from `@codemirror/state`: Used to define and manage state facets.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@codemirror/state` | Provides the `Facet` API for managing state in CodeMirror. |

## Error Handling

The code does not implement specific error handling mechanisms beyond basic exception raising. The facets are defined to combine values by selecting the first one, which assumes that the input arrays are non-empty and valid.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
