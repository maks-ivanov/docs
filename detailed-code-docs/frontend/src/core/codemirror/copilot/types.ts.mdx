## High-level description

The target file `types.ts` defines TypeScript interfaces and types used for managing interactions with a Copilot service, which appears to be an AI-based code completion tool. These interfaces and types are used to structure the data for signing in, signing out, checking status, and handling code completions within a code editor environment.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are TypeScript interfaces and types that define the structure of data exchanged with the Copilot service. These include parameters and results for sign-in, sign-out, and code completion operations. The interfaces are used to ensure type safety and consistency when interacting with the Copilot service.

## Symbols

### `CopilotSignInInitiateParams`
#### Description
An interface representing the parameters required to initiate a sign-in process with the Copilot service. Currently, it is an empty interface, indicating no parameters are needed.

### `CopilotSignInInitiateResult`
#### Description
An interface representing the result of initiating a sign-in process. It includes details necessary for the user to complete the sign-in, such as a verification URI and a user code.

#### Outputs
| Name            | Type   | Description                                      |
|:----------------|:-------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| verificationUri | string | The URI where the user can verify their sign-in. |
| status          | string | The current status of the sign-in process.       |
| userCode        | string | A code provided to the user for sign-in.         |
| expiresIn       | number | Time in seconds until the sign-in expires.       |
| interval        | number | Polling interval in seconds for status updates.  |

### `CopilotSignInConfirmParams`
#### Description
An interface representing the parameters required to confirm a sign-in process. It includes the user code obtained during the sign-in initiation.

#### Inputs
| Name    | Type   | Description                  |
|:--------|:-------|:-----------------------------|
| userCode| string | The code provided to the user.|

### `CopilotSignInConfirmResult`
#### Description
An interface representing the result of confirming a sign-in process. It includes the status of the sign-in and the user identifier.

#### Outputs
| Name  | Type          | Description                        |
|:------|:--------------|:-----------------------------------|
| status| CopilotStatus | The status of the sign-in process. |
| user  | string        | The identifier of the signed-in user.|

### `CopilotSignOutParams`
#### Description
An interface representing the parameters required to sign out from the Copilot service. It is currently an empty interface, indicating no parameters are needed.

### `CopilotSignOutResult`
#### Description
An interface representing the result of a sign-out operation. It includes the status of the sign-out process.

#### Outputs
| Name  | Type          | Description                        |
|:------|:--------------|:-----------------------------------|
| status| CopilotStatus | The status of the sign-out process.|

### `CopilotGetCompletionsParams`
#### Description
An interface representing the parameters required to request code completions from the Copilot service. It includes details about the document and the position where completions are requested.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| doc  | object | Details of the document including source code, tab size, indent size, etc. |

### `CopilotGetCompletionsResult`
#### Description
An interface representing the result of a code completion request. It includes an array of completion suggestions.

#### Outputs
| Name        | Type   | Description                          |
|:------------|:-------|:-------------------------------------|
| completions | Array  | An array of completion suggestions.  |

### `CopilotAcceptCompletionParams`
#### Description
An interface representing the parameters required to accept a code completion suggestion. It includes the unique identifier of the completion.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type   | Description                          |
|:-----|:-------|:-------------------------------------|
| uuid | string | The unique identifier of the completion.|

### `CopilotRejectCompletionParams`
#### Description
An interface representing the parameters required to reject code completion suggestions. It includes an array of unique identifiers for the completions to be rejected.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type   | Description                          |
|:-----|:-------|:-------------------------------------|
| uuids| string[]| An array of unique identifiers for the completions.|

### `CopilotStatus`
#### Description
A type representing the possible statuses of a Copilot account, such as "SignedIn", "NotAuthorized", etc.

### `CopilotRequestStatus`
#### Description
A type representing the possible statuses of a Copilot request, such as "InProgress", "Warning", etc.

## References

The interfaces and types defined in this file are used in the `language-server.ts` file, which implements a client for interacting with the Copilot language server. This client uses the defined types to structure requests and responses for operations like signing in, signing out, and fetching code completions.

## Dependencies

No external libraries or modules are directly used in this file. However, the types and interfaces are utilized by other parts of the codebase, such as the `language-server.ts` file, to interact with the Copilot service.
