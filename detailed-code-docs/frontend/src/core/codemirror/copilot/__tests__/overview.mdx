## High-level description

The target file contains unit tests for the `createWsUrl` function, which is responsible for generating a WebSocket URL based on the current window location. The tests ensure that the function correctly constructs the URL using either the `ws` or `wss` protocol, depending on whether the window's protocol is `http` or `https`.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in the target file is the `describe` block, which contains multiple test cases (`it` blocks) for the `createWsUrl` function. The `beforeAll` and `afterAll` hooks are used to save and restore the original `window` object, ensuring that the tests do not affect the global state.

## References

- `createWsUrl`: This function is imported from the `client.ts` file and is the primary subject of the tests in the target file.

## Symbols

### `describe("createWsUrl")`
#### Description
This block groups together all the test cases related to the `createWsUrl` function. It sets up the necessary environment for testing and contains individual test cases to verify the function's behavior.

### `beforeAll`
#### Description
Saves the original `window` object before any tests are run, allowing it to be restored later.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

### `afterAll`
#### Description
Restores the original `window` object after all tests have been executed, ensuring that the global state is not permanently altered by the tests.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

### `it("should create a WebSocket URL based on the window location")`
#### Description
Tests that the `createWsUrl` function generates a WebSocket URL using the `ws` protocol when the window's protocol is `http`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| window.location.protocol | string | The protocol of the window location, set to "http:" for this test. |
| window.location.hostname | string | The hostname of the window location, set to "localhost" for this test. |
| window.location.port | string | The port of the window location, set to "3000" for this test. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| expectedUrl | string | The expected WebSocket URL, "ws://localhost:30000/copilot". |

### `it("should use wss protocol when window location protocol is https")`
#### Description
Tests that the `createWsUrl` function generates a WebSocket URL using the `wss` protocol when the window's protocol is `https`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| window.location.protocol | string | The protocol of the window location, set to "https:" for this test. |
| window.location.hostname | string | The hostname of the window location, set to "localhost" for this test. |
| window.location.port | string | The port of the window location, set to "3000" for this test. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| expectedUrl | string | The expected WebSocket URL, "wss://localhost:30000/copilot". |

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `vitest` | Used for setting up and running the unit tests. |

## Error Handling

The tests do not include explicit error handling beyond the basic assertions provided by the `expect` function. If the `createWsUrl` function does not return the expected URL, the test will fail, indicating a discrepancy.

## Logging

No logging mechanisms are implemented in the test file.

## TODOs

- The `createWsUrl` function in the related `client.ts` file contains a TODO comment indicating that the WebSocket port should be configurable, rather than relying on appending a "0" to the existing port. This is a potential area for future improvement.
