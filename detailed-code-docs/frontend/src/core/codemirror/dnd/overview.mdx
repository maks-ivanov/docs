## High-level description

The target file defines a drag-and-drop (DnD) extension for the CodeMirror editor, which allows users to drag text into the editor. The extension handles the `drop` and `dragover` events to facilitate this functionality, ensuring that text can be inserted at the correct position within the editor when dropped.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in the code is the `dndBundle` function, which returns an array of event handlers as an `Extension` for the CodeMirror editor. This extension is specifically designed to handle drag-and-drop events within the editor's view.

## Symbols

### `dndBundle`
#### Description
The `dndBundle` function creates and returns a CodeMirror extension that enables drag-and-drop functionality within the editor. It handles the `drop` event to insert text at the drop location and the `dragover` event to allow dropping by preventing the default browser behavior.

#### Inputs
This function does not take any inputs directly, but it operates on the `DragEvent` and `EditorView` objects provided by the CodeMirror framework.

#### Outputs
| Name      | Type      | Description                                      |
|:----------|:----------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| extension | Extension | An array of event handlers for drag-and-drop functionality in CodeMirror. |

#### Internal Logic
- **Drop Event Handling**: 
  - The `drop` event handler retrieves the plain text data from the `dataTransfer` object of the event.
  - If text is available, it prevents the default drop behavior.
  - It calculates the position in the editor where the text should be inserted using `view.posAtCoords`, which converts the mouse coordinates to a document position.
  - If a valid position is found, it dispatches a change to the editor's state to insert the text at the calculated position and scrolls the view to make the change visible.
  
- **Dragover Event Handling**: 
  - The `dragover` event handler simply prevents the default behavior to allow the drop event to occur.

## References

The `dndBundle` function references the following CodeMirror components:
- `EditorView`: Used to access the editor's view and handle DOM events.
- `Extension`: Used to define the extension that will be applied to the editor.

## Dependencies

| Dependency       | Purpose                                                                 |
|:-----------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `@codemirror/state` | Provides the `Extension` type used to define editor extensions.       |
| `@codemirror/view`  | Provides the `EditorView` class used to interact with the editor's view and handle DOM events. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors beyond preventing default browser behaviors for drag-and-drop events. It assumes that the `dataTransfer` object will contain valid text data when a drop occurs.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in this code.

## Side Effects

The `dndBundle` function modifies the editor's state by inserting text at the drop location. It also prevents default browser behaviors for drag-and-drop events to ensure the custom functionality works as intended.
