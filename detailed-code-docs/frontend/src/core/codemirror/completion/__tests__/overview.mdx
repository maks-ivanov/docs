## High-level description

The target file contains unit tests for the `getPositionAtWordBounds` function, which is part of a code completion feature in a text editor. These tests verify that the function correctly identifies the start and end positions of words or tokens within a document, ensuring that the code completion feature can accurately determine word boundaries for providing suggestions.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in this file is the `describe` block, which contains multiple `it` test cases. Each test case calls the `getPositionAtWordBounds` function with different cursor positions in a sample document and checks if the returned start and end positions are correct. The `expect` function is used to assert that the results match the expected values.

## References

- `getPositionAtWordBounds`: This function is imported from the `hints.ts` file and is the primary focus of the tests in this file.
- `Text`: A class from the `@codemirror/state` package used to represent the document being tested.

## Symbols

### `describe("getPositionAtWordBounds", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This block groups together a series of test cases that validate the behavior of the `getPositionAtWordBounds` function. It ensures that the function correctly identifies word boundaries in various scenarios.

### `it("should return correct start and end positions", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
Tests the `getPositionAtWordBounds` function to ensure it returns the correct start and end positions for a word when the cursor is placed in the middle of a word.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| doc | Text | The document containing the text to be analyzed. |
| pos | number | The position of the cursor within the document. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Object | An object containing `startToken` and `endToken` properties indicating the word boundaries. |

### `it("should handle start of string", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
Tests the function's ability to handle cases where the cursor is at the start of a word.

### `it("should handle end of string", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
Tests the function's ability to handle cases where the cursor is at the end of a word.

### `it("should handle nested words", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
Tests the function's ability to handle nested words, ensuring it can correctly identify boundaries within complex expressions.

### `it("should handle numbers", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
Tests the function's ability to handle words that include numbers, ensuring it can correctly identify boundaries for variable names or similar tokens.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `vitest` | Used for writing and running the unit tests. |
| `@codemirror/state` | Provides the `Text` class used to represent the document being tested. |

## Error Handling

The tests do not include explicit error handling mechanisms, as they rely on the `expect` function to throw errors if the actual results do not match the expected values.

## Logging

No logging mechanisms are implemented in this test file.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
