## High-level description

The target file, `extensions.ts`, is a simple module that defines and exports a `Compartment` from the CodeMirror library. This compartment is intended to manage the state of the history feature within a CodeMirror editor instance. The related file, `cm.ts`, shows how this compartment is utilized within a larger setup for configuring a CodeMirror editor, specifically for handling history-related functionalities.

## Code Structure

The target file contains a single export:

- `historyCompartment`: This is an instance of the `Compartment` class from the `@codemirror/state` package. It is used to manage the state of the history feature in a CodeMirror editor.

In the related file `cm.ts`, the `historyCompartment` is used within the `basicBundle` function to configure the history extension of the CodeMirror editor.

## Symbols

### `historyCompartment`
#### Description
The `historyCompartment` is an instance of the `Compartment` class from the CodeMirror state module. It is used to manage and isolate the state of the history feature in a CodeMirror editor setup. This allows for dynamic configuration and reconfiguration of the history state without affecting other parts of the editor's state.

#### Inputs
There are no direct inputs to `historyCompartment` in this file, as it is simply an instance creation.

#### Outputs
| Name               | Type        | Description                                      |
|:-------------------|:------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| `historyCompartment` | `Compartment` | A compartment for managing history state in CodeMirror. |

## References

- **`Compartment`**: Imported from `@codemirror/state`, it is a utility for managing state in a modular way within CodeMirror.
- **`history()`**: A function from the `@codemirror/commands` package, used in the related file to provide history functionality to the editor.

## Dependencies

| Dependency         | Purpose                                                                 |

| `@codemirror/state` | Provides the `Compartment` class used to manage editor state modularly. |

## Error Handling

There is no explicit error handling in the target file, as it only involves the creation of a `Compartment` instance.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in the target file.

## API/Interface Reference

The target file does not define any API or public interface beyond exporting the `historyCompartment`.

## Side Effects

There are no side effects in the target file, as it only involves the instantiation and export of a `Compartment`.

## Performance Considerations

The use of `Compartment` allows for efficient state management by enabling dynamic reconfiguration of the editor's state without needing to recreate the entire editor instance. This can be beneficial in scenarios where the editor's configuration needs to change frequently or dynamically.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the target file.
