## High-level description

The target file defines a utility function `indentOneTab` that is used to indent each line of a given string by one tab space. This function is particularly useful in formatting code or text to ensure consistent indentation, which is often required in code editors or text processing applications.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in the code is the function `indentOneTab`. This function is standalone and does not interact with other symbols within the file. However, it is referenced in other parts of the codebase, as seen in the related code snippets, where it is used to format code strings in language adapters for Markdown and SQL.

## Symbols

### `indentOneTab`
#### Description
The `indentOneTab` function is designed to take a block of text or code and indent each line by one tab space. This is achieved by prepending four spaces (representing a tab) to each line that is not empty.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type   | Description          |
|:-----|:-------|:---------------------|
| code | string | The input string containing multiple lines of text or code that need to be indented. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type   | Description          |
|:-----|:-------|:---------------------|
| result | string | The input string with each line indented by one tab space. |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function first splits the input string `code` into an array of lines using the newline character `\n` as the delimiter.
2. It then maps over each line, checking if the line is empty (i.e., contains only whitespace). If the line is not empty, it prepends four spaces to the line.
3. Finally, it joins the array of lines back into a single string with newline characters, effectively returning the indented text.

## References

The `indentOneTab` function is referenced in the `MarkdownLanguageAdapter` and `SQLLanguageAdapter` classes in the related code snippets. These classes use the function to format code strings when transforming code in and out of their respective language representations.

## Dependencies

There are no external dependencies in the target file. The function operates solely on the input string and uses basic JavaScript string manipulation methods.

## Error Handling

The function does not include explicit error handling. It assumes that the input is a valid string and processes it accordingly. Any issues with the input (e.g., non-string types) would need to be handled by the caller.

## Performance Considerations

The function performs a simple transformation on the input string, which involves splitting, mapping, and joining operations. These operations are efficient for typical use cases involving text or code formatting. However, performance could be a consideration if processing very large strings, as the function processes the entire string in memory.
