## High-level description

The directory contains utility functions designed to assist with text and code formatting within a code editor environment. Specifically, it includes functions for managing indentation and handling string prefixes related to quotes. These utilities are essential for ensuring consistent formatting and handling of strings with special prefixes, which are common in programming languages that support string interpolation or raw strings.

## What does it do?

The utilities in this directory provide two main functionalities:

1. **Indentation Utility**: The `indentOneTab` function is used to format text or code by adding a tab space to each line. This is particularly useful in code editors where consistent indentation is crucial for readability and maintaining code structure. For example, when a user writes code in a text editor, this function can automatically adjust the indentation to ensure that all lines are aligned properly.

2. **Quote Prefix Management**: The utilities in `quotes.ts` handle string prefixes that denote special string types, such as formatted strings or raw strings. The `splitQuotePrefix` function identifies and separates these prefixes from the main string content, while the `upgradePrefixKind` function determines if a string's prefix should be changed based on the presence of substitutions within the string. This is useful in scenarios where a string's content changes dynamically, and the prefix needs to reflect its new state, such as converting a regular string to a formatted string if it contains placeholders for variable substitution.

These utilities are integral to the functionality of a code editor, ensuring that text is formatted correctly and that strings are handled appropriately based on their content and intended use.
