## High-level description

The target file is a test suite for the `getInitialLanguageAdapter` function, which is part of a CodeMirror extension. This function determines the initial language adapter for a given editor state based on the content of the document. The tests verify that the function correctly identifies the language type (e.g., Python, Markdown, SQL) from the document content.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `createState` function and the test suite for `getInitialLanguageAdapter`. The `createState` function is used to set up an `EditorState` with specific configurations, which is then used in the test cases to verify the behavior of `getInitialLanguageAdapter`.

## References

- `adaptiveLanguageConfiguration`: A function imported from the `extension` module, used to configure the editor state with language-specific settings.
- `getInitialLanguageAdapter`: The function under test, which determines the language adapter based on the editor's content.
- `EditorState`: A class from the `@codemirror/state` package used to create and manage the state of a CodeMirror editor.
- `OverridingHotkeyProvider`: A class used to provide custom hotkey configurations.
- `store` and `capabilitiesAtom`: Used to set up global state for the tests, specifically to configure capabilities like SQL and terminal support.

## Symbols

### `createState`
#### Description
The `createState` function creates an `EditorState` with a given document content and a set of extensions, including language configuration and hotkey settings.

#### Inputs
| Name    | Type   | Description          |
|:--------|:-------|:---------------------|
| content | string | The document content to initialize the editor state with. |

#### Outputs
| Name  | Type        | Description                  |
|:------|:------------|:-----------------------------|
| state | EditorState | The initialized editor state.|

#### Internal Logic
- The function initializes an `EditorState` with the provided document content.
- It applies the `adaptiveLanguageConfiguration` extension with specific settings, such as completion configuration and hotkey provider.

### `getInitialLanguageAdapter`
#### Description
This function determines the initial language adapter for a given editor state by analyzing the document content. It returns a language adapter that matches the content, defaulting to Python if no specific language is detected.

#### Inputs
| Name  | Type               | Description                  |
|:------|:-------------------|:-----------------------------|
| state | EditorView["state"] | The state of the editor to analyze. |

#### Outputs
| Name   | Type            | Description                        |
|:-------|:----------------|:-----------------------------------|
| result | LanguageAdapter | The language adapter for the content.|

#### Internal Logic
- The function retrieves the document content as a Python string.
- It checks if the content is empty, in which case it defaults to Python.
- It uses language adapters to determine if the content is supported by Markdown or SQL, returning the appropriate adapter if a match is found.

## Side Effects

- The `beforeAll` hook in the test suite modifies the global state by setting the `capabilitiesAtom` to enable SQL and terminal capabilities.

## Dependencies

| Dependency          | Purpose                                                                 |
|:--------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `@codemirror/state` | Provides the `EditorState` class for managing editor state.             |
| `@/core/hotkeys/hotkeys` | Provides the `OverridingHotkeyProvider` for custom hotkey configurations. |
| `@/core/state/jotai` | Provides the `store` and `capabilitiesAtom` for managing global state. |

## Error Handling

The test suite uses the `expect` function from `vitest` to assert expected outcomes. If the actual result does not match the expected result, an error is thrown, indicating a test failure.

## Logging

No explicit logging is implemented in the code. The test framework (`vitest`) handles output for test results.

## TODOs

No TODOs or notes are present in the code.
