## High-level description

The target file defines an interface `LanguageAdapter` and a type `LanguageAdapterType` for a system that transforms code between different programming languages. The `LanguageAdapter` interface specifies methods for transforming code in and out of a language, checking language support, and obtaining language-specific extensions for a code editor. The `LanguageAdapterType` type enumerates the supported languages: Python, Markdown, and SQL.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `LanguageAdapter` interface and the `LanguageAdapterType` type. The `LanguageAdapter` interface is designed to be implemented by classes that handle language-specific transformations and editor configurations. The `LanguageAdapterType` type is used to specify the language types that the adapters can handle.

## Symbols

### `LanguageAdapter`
#### Description
The `LanguageAdapter` interface defines a contract for classes that transform code between different languages and provide language-specific editor extensions. It includes methods for transforming code into and out of a language, checking if a language is supported, and obtaining editor extensions.

#### Inputs
- `code` (string): The code to be transformed or checked for support.
- `completionConfig` (CompletionConfig): Configuration for code completion.
- `hotkeys` (HotkeyProvider): Provider for hotkey configurations.
- `placeholderType` (PlaceholderType): Type of placeholder to use in the editor.
- `movementCallbacks` (MovementCallbacks): Callbacks for cell movement actions.

#### Outputs
- `transformIn` and `transformOut`: Returns a tuple containing the transformed code and a cursor position offset.
- `isSupported`: Returns a boolean indicating if the language is supported.
- `getExtension`: Returns an array of `Extension` objects for the editor.

#### Internal Logic
The `LanguageAdapter` interface does not implement any logic itself but defines the methods that must be implemented by any class that adheres to this interface. The logic for each method would be specific to the language being adapted.

### `LanguageAdapterType`
#### Description
The `LanguageAdapterType` type is a union type that specifies the supported language types: "python", "markdown", and "sql". It is used to identify the type of language adapter being used.

## References

- `CompletionConfig`: Imported from `@/core/config/config-schema`, used for configuring code completion.
- `HotkeyProvider`: Imported from `@/core/hotkeys/hotkeys`, used for managing hotkey configurations.
- `Extension`: Imported from `@codemirror/state`, represents extensions for the CodeMirror editor.
- `PlaceholderType`: Imported from `../config/extension`, used to specify the type of placeholder in the editor.
- `MovementCallbacks`: Imported from `../cells/extensions`, provides callbacks for cell movement actions.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@codemirror/state` | Provides the `Extension` type used for editor extensions. |

## Error Handling

The interface does not include any error handling mechanisms, as it is a contract for implementation. Error handling would be implemented in the classes that implement this interface.

## Logging

There are no logging mechanisms implemented in this interface, as it is a contract for implementation. Logging would be implemented in the classes that implement this interface.
