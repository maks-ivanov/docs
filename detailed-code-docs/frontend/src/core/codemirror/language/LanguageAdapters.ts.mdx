## High-level description

The `LanguageAdapters.ts` file defines a set of language adapters for a code editor, specifically for Python, Markdown, and SQL. It provides a mechanism to instantiate these adapters and a utility function to retrieve all available language adapters. These adapters are used to transform and manage code in different languages within the editor.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `LanguageAdapters` object and the `getLanguageAdapters` function. The `LanguageAdapters` object is a record that maps language types to their respective adapter instantiation functions. The `getLanguageAdapters` function retrieves and instantiates all language adapters defined in the `LanguageAdapters` object.

## Symbols

### `LanguageAdapters`
#### Description
`LanguageAdapters` is a record that maps each `LanguageAdapterType` to a function that returns a new instance of the corresponding `LanguageAdapter`. It includes adapters for Python, Markdown, and SQL.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | N/A         |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | Record&lt;LanguageAdapterType, () =&gt; LanguageAdapter&gt; | A record mapping language types to their adapter instantiation functions. |

### `getLanguageAdapters`
#### Description
`getLanguageAdapters` is a function that returns an array of instantiated language adapters by invoking each function in the `LanguageAdapters` record.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | N/A         |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | LanguageAdapter[] | An array of instantiated language adapters. |

#### Internal Logic
The function iterates over the values of the `LanguageAdapters` record, calls each function to instantiate the adapter, and returns the resulting array of adapters.

## References

- `LanguageAdapter` and `LanguageAdapterType` are imported from `./types`, which define the interface and type for language adapters.
- `PythonLanguageAdapter`, `MarkdownLanguageAdapter`, and `SQLLanguageAdapter` are imported from their respective files, each implementing the `LanguageAdapter` interface.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `./types` | Provides the `LanguageAdapter` interface and `LanguageAdapterType` type. |
| `./python` | Contains the implementation of the `PythonLanguageAdapter`. |
| `./markdown` | Contains the implementation of the `MarkdownLanguageAdapter`. |
| `./sql` | Contains the implementation of the `SQLLanguageAdapter`. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the instantiation functions for each language adapter will succeed without exceptions.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The file does not expose an API or public interface beyond the `LanguageAdapters` record and the `getLanguageAdapters` function. These are used internally within the codebase to manage language-specific behavior in the editor.
