## High-level description

The target file `cm.ts` is responsible for setting up the CodeMirror editor with various extensions and configurations tailored for a specific cell in a notebook-like environment. It integrates features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, bracket matching, and custom keymaps, among others, to enhance the code editing experience.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are interconnected as follows:
- `setupCodeMirror`: This function is the primary entry point for setting up the CodeMirror editor. It utilizes various bundles and configurations to customize the editor's behavior.
- `basicBundle`: This function provides a set of default extensions and configurations for the CodeMirror editor, including view settings, language support, and editing features.
- `startCompletionAtEndOfLine`: A utility function to trigger code completion at the end of a line if certain conditions are met.

## Symbols

### `setupCodeMirror`
#### Description
Sets up the CodeMirror editor for a specific cell with a variety of extensions and configurations based on the provided options.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| opts | `CodeMirrorSetupOpts` | Configuration options for setting up the CodeMirror editor, including cell ID, callbacks, theme, and more. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | `Extension[]` | An array of CodeMirror extensions configured for the editor. |

#### Internal Logic
- The function extracts necessary options from the input and returns an array of extensions.
- It includes keymap configurations, cell movement and editing bundles, and a basic setup bundle.
- The `goToDefinitionBundle` is added to support navigation features like going to the definition of a symbol.

### `basicBundle`
#### Description
Provides a set of default extensions and configurations for the CodeMirror editor, including view settings, language support, and editing features.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| opts | `CodeMirrorSetupOpts` | Configuration options for setting up the basic bundle, including theme and completion configuration. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | `Extension[]` | An array of CodeMirror extensions configured for the basic setup. |

#### Internal Logic
- Configures the editor view with features like line wrapping, selection drawing, and tooltips.
- Sets up syntax highlighting, bracket matching, and indentation rules.
- Integrates language support and editing features like history and find-replace functionality.
- Configures keymaps for specific actions like accepting completions and indenting code.

### `startCompletionAtEndOfLine`
#### Description
Determines whether to start code completion at the end of a line based on the current cursor position and line content.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cm | `EditorView` | The CodeMirror editor view instance. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | `boolean` | Returns `true` if completion is started, otherwise `false`. |

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if the current selection is empty and if the cursor is at the end of a line.
- If the line content before the cursor is not just whitespace, it triggers the `startCompletion` function.

## References

- `keymapBundle`: Used in `setupCodeMirror` to configure keymaps based on user preferences.
- `cellMovementBundle` and `cellCodeEditingBundle`: Used in `setupCodeMirror` to handle cell-specific movement and editing actions.
- `goToDefinitionBundle`: Provides functionality to navigate to symbol definitions within the editor.
- `findReplaceBundle`, `copilotBundle`, `adaptiveLanguageConfiguration`: Various extensions used in `basicBundle` to enhance the editor's capabilities.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@codemirror/autocomplete` | Provides autocomplete functionality. |
| `@codemirror/commands` | Offers command utilities like history and indentation. |
| `@codemirror/language` | Supplies language-related features like syntax highlighting. |
| `@codemirror/view` | Core view components for rendering the editor. |
| `@codemirror/state` | Manages the editor's state and extensions. |
| `@codemirror/theme-one-dark` | Provides a dark theme for the editor. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors beyond basic checks, such as ensuring the cursor is at the end of a line before starting completion. More robust error handling might be implemented elsewhere in the application.

## Logging

No logging mechanisms are implemented in this file. Logging might be handled in other parts of the application, especially for debugging or monitoring purposes.
