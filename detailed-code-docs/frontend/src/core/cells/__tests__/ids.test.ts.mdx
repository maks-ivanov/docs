title: "ids.test.ts"
---

## High-level description

The target file contains unit tests for the `CellId` and `HTMLCellId` functionalities, which are defined in the related file `ids.ts`. These tests verify the creation, parsing, and element-finding capabilities of these identifiers, ensuring that they behave as expected when generating unique IDs and interacting with HTML elements.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are `CellId` and `HTMLCellId`, both of which are types and objects defined in the related file `ids.ts`. The `CellId` is a simple identifier, while `HTMLCellId` is a prefixed version used for HTML elements. The tests in the target file validate the methods associated with these symbols, such as `create`, `parse`, and `findElement`.

## References

- `CellId` and `HTMLCellId` are referenced from the `ids.ts` file, where their logic is implemented.
- The `invariant` function is used in `ids.ts` to ensure that certain conditions are met.

## Symbols

### `describe("CellId", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This block contains tests for the `CellId` functionality, specifically testing the creation of a `CellId`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | N/A  | The test does not take external inputs. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cellId | string | A randomly generated string representing a `CellId`. |

#### Internal Logic
- Calls `CellId.create()` to generate a new ID.
- Asserts that the generated ID is a non-empty string.

### `describe("HTMLCellId", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This block contains tests for the `HTMLCellId` functionality, including creation, parsing, and finding elements by ID.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | N/A  | The test does not take external inputs. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| htmlCellId | string | A string representing an `HTMLCellId`. |
| parsedCellId | string | The original `CellId` extracted from an `HTMLCellId`. |
| cell | Element | The HTML element with an ID matching the `HTMLCellId` pattern. |

#### Internal Logic
- **Create Test**: 
  - Generates a `CellId` and uses it to create an `HTMLCellId`.
  - Asserts that the `HTMLCellId` is correctly prefixed with "cell-".
- **Parse Test**: 
  - Creates an `HTMLCellId` and parses it back to the original `CellId`.
  - Asserts that the parsed ID matches the original.
- **FindElement Test**: 
  - Sets up a mock HTML structure and attempts to find an element with an `HTMLCellId`.
  - Asserts that the correct element is found and its ID starts with "cell-".

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `vitest`   | Used for writing and running the unit tests. |

## Error Handling

The tests rely on assertions to handle errors. If an assertion fails, it indicates a problem with the functionality being tested.

## Logging

No explicit logging is implemented in the test file. The test framework (`vitest`) handles output and reporting of test results.

## TODOs

No TODOs or notes are present in the code.
