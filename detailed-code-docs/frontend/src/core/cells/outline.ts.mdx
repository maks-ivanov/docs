## High-level description

The target file defines TypeScript interfaces for representing an outline structure, specifically for a table of contents. The `OutlineItem` interface describes individual items in the outline, including their name, location, and hierarchical level. The `Outline` interface is a collection of these items. This structure is used to manage and display outlines, such as those found in documents or notebooks, within a frontend application.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `OutlineItem` and `Outline` interfaces. The `OutlineItem` interface represents a single entry in the outline, while the `Outline` interface is a collection of `OutlineItem` objects. These interfaces are used to define the structure and properties of outlines that can be rendered or manipulated in the application.

## Symbols

### `OutlineItem`
#### Description
The `OutlineItem` interface represents a single item in an outline, such as a heading in a document. It includes properties for the item's name, a locator to identify its position in the document, and its hierarchical level.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | The human-readable heading name. |
| by | { id: string } \| { path: string } | Locator of the item, either by an ID or an XPath. |
| level | number | The level of the item, corresponding to heading levels (e.g., h1 -&gt; 1). |

#### Outputs
This is an interface, so it does not produce outputs directly. It defines a structure for data.

### `Outline`
#### Description
The `Outline` interface represents a collection of `OutlineItem` objects, effectively forming a table of contents or a similar hierarchical structure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| items | OutlineItem[] | An array of `OutlineItem` objects representing the outline. |

#### Outputs
This is an interface, so it does not produce outputs directly. It defines a structure for data.

## References

- The `OutlineItem` and `Outline` interfaces are referenced in other parts of the codebase, such as in the `floating-outline.tsx` and `useActiveOutline.tsx` files, where they are used to manage and render outlines in the user interface.
- The `Outline` interface is also used in the `types.ts` file to define the structure of cell runtime states, indicating that outlines are part of the cell's data model.

## Dependencies

There are no external dependencies directly in the target file, as it only defines TypeScript interfaces. However, these interfaces are used in conjunction with other parts of the application that may have dependencies.

## Error Handling

The target file does not include any error handling, as it only defines data structures. Error handling would be implemented in the functions and components that utilize these interfaces.

## Logging

The target file does not implement any logging, as it only defines data structures. Logging would be implemented in the functions and components that utilize these interfaces.

## API/Interface Reference

The target file does not define an API or public interface directly. It provides data structures that are used by other parts of the application to manage and render outlines.
