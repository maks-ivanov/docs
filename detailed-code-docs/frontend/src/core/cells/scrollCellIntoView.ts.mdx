## High-level description

The target file, `scrollCellIntoView.ts`, provides utility functions to manage the focus and scrolling behavior of cells within a web-based editor interface. It includes functions to focus on a specific cell, scroll it into view, and handle the visibility of cell outputs. These functions are essential for ensuring a smooth user experience when navigating through a document with multiple cells, such as a notebook interface.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are interconnected as follows:
- `focusAndScrollCellIntoView`: This function focuses on a specific cell and scrolls it into view, with additional logic to handle code editor focus and cursor positioning.
- `focusAndScrollCellOutputIntoView`: This function focuses on the output of a specific cell and scrolls it into view.
- `scrollToBottom` and `scrollToTop`: These functions scroll the entire page to the bottom or top, respectively.

## References

- `Logger`: Used for logging warnings when elements are not found.
- `HTMLCellId`: Utilized to generate HTML element IDs for cells.
- `goToVariableDefinition`: A function from another module that is used to navigate to a variable definition within the editor.

## Symbols

### `focusAndScrollCellIntoView`
#### Description
This function focuses on a specified cell and scrolls it into view. It also manages the focus of the code editor within the cell and can position the cursor at the top, bottom, or at a specific variable definition.

#### Inputs
| Name         | Type                | Description                                                                 |
|:-------------|:--------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| cellId       | CellId              | The unique identifier of the cell to focus and scroll into view.            |
| cell         | RefObject&lt;CellHandle&gt; | A reference to the cell's handle, which includes the editor view.           |
| config       | CellConfig          | Configuration settings for the cell, such as whether the code is hidden.    |
| codeFocus    | "top" \| "bottom" \| undefined | Determines where to position the cursor in the editor.                     |
| variableName | string \| undefined | The name of a variable to focus on within the editor, if applicable.        |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the cell reference is valid.
2. Retrieves the HTML element for the cell using its ID.
3. Logs a warning if the element is not found.
4. If the cell's code is hidden, focuses the cell element.
5. If the code is visible, focuses the editor and positions the cursor based on `codeFocus` or `variableName`.
6. Scrolls the cell element into view smoothly.

### `focusAndScrollCellOutputIntoView`
#### Description
This function focuses on the output of a specified cell and scrolls it into view, adding a temporary focus outline for visual feedback.

#### Inputs
| Name   | Type   | Description                                      |
|:-------|:-------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| cellId | CellId | The unique identifier of the cell output to focus and scroll into view. |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the HTML element for the cell output using its ID.
2. Logs a warning if the element is not found.
3. Adds a focus outline class to the element, which is removed after 2 seconds.
4. Scrolls the element into view smoothly, centering it in the viewport.

### `scrollToBottom`
#### Description
Scrolls the entire page to the bottom smoothly.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the main application element by its ID.
2. Scrolls the element to its maximum scroll height.

### `scrollToTop`
#### Description
Scrolls the entire page to the top smoothly.

#### Inputs

## Error Handling

The code handles errors by logging warnings when expected elements are not found in the DOM, using the `Logger` utility.

## Logging

The `Logger` utility is used to log warnings when elements are not found, which helps in debugging issues related to missing or incorrectly identified elements.
