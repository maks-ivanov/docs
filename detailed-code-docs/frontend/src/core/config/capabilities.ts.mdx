## High-level description

The target file, `capabilities.ts`, defines a Jotai atom named `capabilitiesAtom` that holds the capabilities of a system, specifically whether SQL and terminal functionalities are enabled. This atom is used throughout the application to manage and access the state of these capabilities, allowing different parts of the application to react to changes in these capabilities.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in this file is the `capabilitiesAtom`, which is an instance of a Jotai atom. It is initialized with a `Capabilities` object that has two boolean properties: `sql` and `terminal`. This atom is used in various parts of the application to determine if certain features should be enabled or disabled based on the current capabilities.

## Symbols

### `capabilitiesAtom`
#### Description
The `capabilitiesAtom` is a Jotai atom that holds the state of the system's capabilities, specifically whether SQL and terminal functionalities are enabled. It is initialized with default values indicating that both capabilities are disabled.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | N/A         |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| capabilitiesAtom | Atom&lt;Capabilities&gt; | A Jotai atom representing the state of system capabilities. |

## References

- The `capabilitiesAtom` is referenced in several related files, such as `CellArray.tsx`, `extension.test.ts`, `sql.test.ts`, `sql.ts`, and `if-capability.tsx`. These references indicate that the atom is used to conditionally enable or disable features like SQL execution and terminal access based on the current capabilities.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| jotai | Used to create and manage the `capabilitiesAtom`. |

## Error Handling

The target file does not implement any specific error handling mechanisms, as it primarily defines a state atom without any complex logic or operations that could result in errors.

## Logging

The target file does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## Side Effects

There are no side effects in the target file, as it only defines a state atom without performing any operations that modify external state or resources.

## Performance Considerations

The `capabilitiesAtom` is a simple state holder and does not have any performance-critical operations. However, its usage in the application can affect performance if the state changes frequently and triggers re-renders in components that depend on it.

## Configuration

There are no configuration options defined in the target file.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the target file.
