## High-level description

The CSS code in the target file is designed to ensure that both the `marimo-ui-element` and its child elements are displayed as if they were not wrapped in a custom element. This is achieved by setting the `display` property to `contents`, which allows the elements to be rendered as if they are part of the normal document flow, without introducing additional layout or styling constraints typically associated with custom elements.

## Code Structure

The CSS file is straightforward and consists of a single rule that applies to the `marimo-ui-element` and its direct children. This rule is intended to affect the layout and rendering of these elements in the DOM.

## Symbols

### `marimo-ui-element`
#### Description
The `marimo-ui-element` is a custom web component that is styled to behave as if it is not a wrapper around its child elements. This is accomplished by using the `display: contents` CSS property, which makes the element and its children participate in the document's layout as if they were not wrapped in a custom element.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | The CSS affects the rendering of the `marimo-ui-element` and its children, but does not produce outputs in the traditional sense. |
