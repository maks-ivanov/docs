## High-level description

The directory contains unit tests for functions related to HTML parsing and manipulation within the `frontend/src/core/dom` module. Specifically, it includes tests for the `htmlUtils` and `outline` modules. The tests are designed to ensure that the functions correctly handle various scenarios and data types, providing reliable parsing and manipulation of HTML content. The tests are implemented using the `vitest` testing framework.

## What does it do?

The tests in this directory verify the functionality of HTML parsing and manipulation functions. They ensure that:

1. **`parseInitialValue` Function**: This function is tested to confirm it can accurately parse the `data-initial-value` attribute from an HTML element. The tests cover different data types and scenarios, including cases where the attribute is missing.

2. **Outline Functions**: Several functions related to document outlines are tested:
   - **`parseOutline`**: This function is tested to ensure it can parse HTML content into a structured outline, handling both valid and invalid inputs.
   - **`mergeOutlines`**: This function is tested to verify it can merge multiple outline objects into a single cohesive outline.
   - **`canCollapseOutline`**: This function is tested to determine if an outline can be collapsed based on its structure.
   - **`findCollapseRange`**: This function is tested to identify the range of outlines that can be collapsed starting from a specified index.

These tests help ensure that the HTML parsing and manipulation functions work as expected, providing a robust foundation for handling HTML content in the application.

## Entry points

The main files in this directory are `htmlUtils.test.ts` and `outline.test.ts`. These files contain the test cases for their respective modules, organized using `describe` and `it` blocks to group related tests and specify individual test cases. The tests are executed using the `vitest` framework, which provides the necessary tools for defining and running the tests.

## Dependencies

The directory relies on the `vitest` testing framework to define and execute the unit tests. This framework was chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in handling JavaScript and TypeScript testing scenarios.
