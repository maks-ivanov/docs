## High-level description

The target file contains unit tests for the `waitFor` function, which is part of a state management system using Jotai. The tests verify that the `waitFor` function correctly resolves when an atom's value satisfies a given predicate, either immediately or after a change.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `waitFor` function and the `store` object, both imported from the `jotai.ts` file. The `waitFor` function is tested using the `vitest` testing framework, with the `describe` and `it` functions organizing the test cases.

## References

- `store`: A global state store created using Jotai's `createStore` function.
- `waitFor`: A function that waits for an atom to satisfy a predicate before resolving.

## Symbols

### `describe`
#### Description
The `describe` function is used to group related test cases. In this file, it groups tests for the `waitFor` function.

### `it`
#### Description
The `it` function defines individual test cases. Each test case checks a specific behavior of the `waitFor` function.

### `waitFor`
#### Description
The `waitFor` function is designed to wait for a Jotai atom to satisfy a given predicate. It resolves with the atom's value once the predicate is true.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| atom | Atom&lt;T&gt; | The Jotai atom whose value is being monitored. |
| predicate | function | A function that takes the atom's value and returns a boolean indicating if the condition is met. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Promise&lt;T&gt; | A promise that resolves with the atom's value once the predicate is satisfied. |

#### Internal Logic
The `waitFor` function first checks if the predicate is satisfied with the current value of the atom. If so, it resolves immediately. Otherwise, it subscribes to changes in the atom and resolves once the predicate is satisfied.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `vitest` | Used for writing and running unit tests. |
| `jotai` | Provides the atom and store functionalities for state management. |

## Error Handling

The `waitFor` function does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the predicate function and atom operations will not throw exceptions.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in the target file.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
