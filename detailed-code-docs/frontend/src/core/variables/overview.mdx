## High-level description

The `frontend/src/core/variables` directory is part of a frontend application that manages the state of variables, likely in a cell-based environment such as a notebook. This directory includes functionality for defining, manipulating, and testing the state of these variables. The main components within this directory are:

- **State Management (`state.ts`)**: Utilizes the Jotai library to manage the state of variables, providing actions to set, add, and update metadata for variables.
- **Type Definitions (`types.ts`)**: Defines TypeScript types for variables, ensuring type safety and clarity in the codebase.
- **Unit Tests (`__tests__/state.test.ts`)**: Contains tests to verify the correct functionality of the state management logic.

## What does it do?

The code in this directory manages the lifecycle of variables within a frontend application. It allows for:

1. **Defining Variables**: Variables are defined with a name, the cells that declare and use them, and optional metadata such as value and data type.
2. **State Management**: Using Jotai, the code manages the state of these variables, allowing for operations such as setting a new state of variables, adding new variables to the existing state, and updating metadata for existing variables.
3. **Testing**: The unit tests ensure that the state management logic behaves as expected, verifying that variables are correctly set, added, and updated.

## Entry points

The main files in this directory are:

- **`state.ts`**: This file is the core of the state management system for variables. It defines the initial state, actions, and hooks for interacting with the state.
- **`types.ts`**: Provides the necessary TypeScript types that define the structure and relationships of variables.
- **`__tests__/state.test.ts`**: Contains unit tests that validate the functionality of the state management logic.

## Key Files

- **`state.ts`**: This file is crucial for managing the state of variables. It uses Jotai to create atoms and hooks that allow other parts of the application to interact with the variable state. It defines actions like `setVariables`, `addVariables`, and `setMetadata` to manipulate the state.

- **`types.ts`**: This file defines the types used throughout the variable management system. It includes types like `VariableName`, `Variable`, and `Variables`, which are essential for ensuring type safety and consistency in how variables are handled.

- **`__tests__/state.test.ts`**: This file contains unit tests that ensure the state management logic in `state.ts` works correctly. It tests the actions defined in `state.ts` to verify that they correctly update the state of variables.

## Dependencies

- **`jotai`**: This library is used for state management, providing a simple and efficient way to manage the state of variables using atoms and hooks.
- **`vitest`**: A testing framework used to write and run the unit tests in `__tests__/state.test.ts`.

These dependencies are chosen for their ability to efficiently manage state and facilitate testing in a React-based frontend application.
