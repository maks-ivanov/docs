## High-level description

The target file, `types.ts`, defines TypeScript types related to variables used in a frontend application. It provides a structure for representing variables, including their names, the cells that declare and use them, and optional metadata such as their value and data type. This file is crucial for managing and tracking variable dependencies within a cell-based environment, likely used in a notebook or similar application.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are interconnected as follows:
- `VariableName` is a specialized string type used to uniquely identify variable names.
- `Variable` is an interface that represents a variable, including its name, the cells that declare and use it, and optional metadata.
- `Variables` is a type that maps `VariableName` to `Variable`, effectively creating a dictionary of variables.

## Symbols

### `VariableName`
#### Description
`VariableName` is a type alias for a `TypedString` with the type parameter `"VariableName"`. It is used to ensure that variable names are treated as a distinct type of string, providing type safety and clarity in the codebase.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

### `Variable`
#### Description
The `Variable` interface defines the structure of a variable within the application. It includes the variable's name, the cells that declare and use it, and optional metadata such as its value and data type.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | VariableName | The unique name of the variable. |
| declaredBy | CellId[] | An array of cell IDs that declare the variable. |
| usedBy | CellId[] | An array of cell IDs that use the variable. |
| value | string \| null | An optional string representation of the variable's value. |
| dataType | string \| null | An optional string representing the type of the variable's value. |

#### Outputs
None

### `Variables`
#### Description
`Variables` is a type alias for a `Record` that maps `VariableName` to `Variable`. This type represents a collection of variables, allowing for easy access and manipulation of variable data within the application.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

## References

- `CellId` from `../cells/ids`: Used to identify cells that declare or use a variable.
- `TypedString` from `../../utils/typed`: Utilized to create the `VariableName` type, ensuring type safety for variable names.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `TypedString` | Provides a mechanism to create strongly-typed strings, used for defining `VariableName`. |
| `CellId` | Represents the unique identifier for cells, used in the `Variable` interface to track which cells declare and use a variable. |

The target file does not define any configuration options, error handling, logging, or API interfaces. It is primarily focused on defining types for use in other parts of the application.
