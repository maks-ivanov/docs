## High-level description

The target file, `state.ts`, is responsible for managing the state of variables in a frontend application using the Jotai state management library. It defines a set of actions and a reducer to manipulate the state of variables, allowing for operations such as setting, adding, and updating metadata of variables. The file also provides hooks for accessing the current state and actions related to variables.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are interconnected as follows:
- `initialState`: A function that initializes the state of variables as an empty object.
- `createReducerAndAtoms`: A utility function that creates a reducer, actions, and atoms for managing state.
- `variablesAtom`: An atom representing the state of variables.
- `useVariables`: A hook to access the current state of variables.
- `useVariablesActions`: A hook to access actions for manipulating the state of variables.
- `exportedForTesting`: An object that exports the reducer, actions, and initial state for testing purposes.

## References

- `createReducerAndAtoms` from `@/utils/createReducer`: This utility function is crucial for creating the reducer and actions used in the file.
- `useAtomValue` from `jotai`: Used to access the current value of an atom.
- Types `Variable`, `VariableName`, and `Variables` from `./types`: These types define the structure of the variable state.

## Symbols

### `initialState`
#### Description
Initializes the state of variables as an empty object.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| state | Variables | An empty object representing the initial state of variables. |

### `createReducerAndAtoms`
#### Description
Creates a reducer, actions, and atoms for managing the state of variables. It defines three main actions: `setVariables`, `addVariables`, and `setMetadata`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| initialState | function | A function that returns the initial state of variables. |
| reducers | object | An object defining the actions and their corresponding reducer functions. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| reducer | function | A reducer function to handle state transitions. |
| createActions | function | A function to create actions for dispatching state changes. |
| valueAtom | atom | An atom representing the state of variables. |
| useActions | function | A hook to access actions for manipulating the state. |

#### Internal Logic
- **`setVariables`**: Replaces the current state with a new set of variables, preserving metadata from the old state.
- **`addVariables`**: Adds new variables to the current state, merging them with existing ones.
- **`setMetadata`**: Updates metadata for existing variables in the state.

### `useVariables`
#### Description
A React hook to access the current state of variables.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| variables | Variables | The current state of variables. |

### `useVariablesActions`
#### Description
A React hook to access actions for manipulating the state of variables.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| actions | object | An object containing actions to manipulate the state of variables. |

### `variablesAtom`
#### Description
An atom representing the state of variables, used to store and manage the state within the Jotai framework.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `jotai` | Used for state management, providing atoms and hooks to manage state. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors within the reducer functions. It assumes that the actions will be dispatched with valid payloads.

## Logging

The `createReducer` utility function logs an error if an undefined action type is dispatched, helping to identify issues during development.

## TODOs

No TODOs or notes are present in the code.
