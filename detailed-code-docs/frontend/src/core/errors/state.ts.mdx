## High-level description

The target file, `state.ts`, is responsible for managing the state of banner messages in a React application using the Jotai state management library. It defines a state structure for banners, provides actions to manipulate this state (such as adding, removing, and clearing banners), and exposes hooks to access the current state and actions.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are interconnected as follows:
- `BannerState`: An interface defining the structure of the banner state.
- `createReducerAndAtoms`: A utility function used to create a reducer and associated atoms for managing state.
- `bannersAtom`: An atom representing the current state of banners.
- `useActions`: A hook to access actions for modifying the banner state.
- `useBanners`: A hook to access the current banner state.
- `useBannersActions`: A hook to access the actions for modifying the banner state.

## References

- `createReducerAndAtoms`: This utility function is imported from `@/utils/createReducer` and is crucial for setting up the state management logic.
- `useAtomValue`: A hook from the Jotai library used to read the value of an atom.
- `generateUUID`: A utility function imported from `@/utils/uuid` to generate unique identifiers for banners.
- `Identified`: A type from `@/utils/typed` used to ensure that each banner has a unique identifier.

## Symbols

### `BannerState`
#### Description
Defines the structure of the state for managing banners, which includes an array of identified banners.

#### Inputs
None directly, but it is used as a type for the state managed by the reducer.

#### Outputs
None directly, but it is used to type the state returned by the reducer.

### `createReducerAndAtoms`
#### Description
A utility function that creates a reducer and associated atoms for managing state. It is used to define the initial state and actions for the banner state.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| initialState | `() =&gt; State` | A function returning the initial state. |
| reducers | `ReducerHandlers&lt;State&gt;` | An object defining the reducer functions for state transitions. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| valueAtom | `Atom&lt;State&gt;` | An atom representing the current state. |
| useActions | `() =&gt; ReducerActions&lt;RH&gt;` | A hook to access actions for modifying the state. |

### `useBanners`
#### Description
A React hook that provides access to the current banner state by using the `bannersAtom`.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| banners | `Array&lt;Identified&lt;Banner&gt;&gt;` | The current list of banners. |

### `useBannersActions`
#### Description
A React hook that provides access to actions for modifying the banner state, such as adding, removing, and clearing banners.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| actions | `ReducerActions&lt;RH&gt;` | An object containing actions to modify the banner state. |

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `jotai` | Used for state management with atoms. |
| `@/utils/createReducer` | Provides the `createReducerAndAtoms` utility for setting up state management. |
| `@/utils/uuid` | Provides the `generateUUID` function to generate unique identifiers for banners. |
| `@/utils/typed` | Provides the `Identified` type to ensure banners have unique identifiers. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors beyond the basic functionality provided by the Jotai library and the utility functions used.

## Logging

There is no explicit logging in this code. Any errors or issues would need to be handled by the consuming components or through additional middleware in the state management setup.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
