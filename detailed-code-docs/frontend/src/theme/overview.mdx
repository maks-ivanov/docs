## High-level description

The `frontend/src/theme` directory is responsible for managing and applying themes within a React application. It provides components and hooks to dynamically apply and manage themes, ensuring a consistent look and feel across the application. The main components and modules within this directory include:

- `ThemeProvider.tsx`: A React component that applies a theme to the application by modifying the document's body classes.
- `namespace.tsx`: A React component that scopes styles to a specific DOM subtree, creating a namespace for styles.
- `useTheme.ts`: A module that manages theme determination using Jotai state management, providing a hook to access the current theme.

## What does it do?

The code in this directory facilitates a dynamic theming experience for a React application. It allows the application to switch between different themes, such as "light" and "dark", based on user preferences or system settings. Here's how it works:

1. **Theme Management**: The `useTheme.ts` file uses Jotai atoms to manage the theme state. It determines the theme based on user configuration or system preferences. The `themeAtom` decides the theme, while the `prefersDarkModeAtom` listens to system theme changes. The `resolvedThemeAtom` resolves the final theme to be used, which can be accessed by components using the `useTheme` hook.

2. **Theme Application**: The `ThemeProvider.tsx` component uses the `useTheme` hook to get the current theme and applies it to the document's body. This ensures that the entire application reflects the selected theme. The component also includes a `CssVariables` component that allows for the dynamic application of CSS variables, enabling fine-grained control over styling.

3. **Style Scoping**: The `namespace.tsx` file provides a `StyleNamespace` component that wraps its children with a `div` element, applying a specific class and style. This creates a namespace for styles, ensuring that styles are scoped to the component's children, preventing style leakage and conflicts.

Overall, this setup allows for a flexible and responsive theming system that can adapt to user preferences and system settings, providing a seamless user experience.
