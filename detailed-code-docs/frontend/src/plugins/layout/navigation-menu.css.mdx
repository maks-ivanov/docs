## High-level description

The CSS file `navigation-menu.css` is designed to manage the appearance of a navigation menu, specifically when the sidebar is in a collapsed state. It ensures that only icons are visible while the text is hidden when the sidebar's width is below a certain threshold, enhancing the user interface for compact displays.

## Code Structure

The CSS rules in this file are primarily focused on the `.auto-collapse-nav` class, which is used to control the visibility and layout of elements within a navigation menu when the sidebar is collapsed. The rules are applied conditionally based on the container's width, using the `@container` query.

## Symbols

### `.auto-collapse-nav[data-orientation="vertical"]`
#### Description
This rule sets the `container-type` to `inline-size` for elements with the class `.auto-collapse-nav` and a `data-orientation` attribute of "vertical". This prepares the element for container queries based on its inline size.

### `@container (max-width: 200px)`
#### Description
This container query applies styles to elements within `.auto-collapse-nav` when the container's width is 200 pixels or less. It is used to adjust the layout and visibility of elements for a compact view.

#### Internal Logic
- **Text Visibility**: The `.paragraph` class within `.auto-collapse-nav` has its text hidden by setting `visibility` to `hidden`, `font-size` to `0`, and `line-height` to `0`.
- **Icon Visibility**: The `iconify-icon` within `.paragraph` is made visible, with styles applied to ensure proper sizing and alignment.
- **List Item Layout**: List items (`li &gt; *`) are styled to occupy full width and center their content.
- **Icon-only Items**: List items that do not contain an `iconify-icon` are hidden.
- **Heading Elements**: Any heading elements (`h1` to `h6`) within `.auto-collapse-nav` are hidden.
