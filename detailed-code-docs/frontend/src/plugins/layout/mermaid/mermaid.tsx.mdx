## High-level description

The `mermaid.tsx` file defines a React component named `Mermaid` that is responsible for rendering diagrams using the Mermaid library. It initializes Mermaid with a default configuration, adapts the theme based on the current application theme, and uses an asynchronous data hook to render the diagram as an SVG within a React component.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `Mermaid` React component, the `DEFAULT_CONFIG` object, and the `randomAlpha` function. The `Mermaid` component uses the `useAsyncData` hook to fetch and render the diagram asynchronously. The `DEFAULT_CONFIG` provides a base configuration for Mermaid, which can be overridden by the component's props. The `randomAlpha` function generates a random string used as an identifier for the Mermaid diagram.

## References

- `useAsyncData`: A custom hook used to handle asynchronous data fetching and rendering.
- `useTheme`: A hook to determine the current theme of the application.
- `Logger`: A utility for logging warnings and errors.

## Symbols

### `DEFAULT_CONFIG`
#### Description
`DEFAULT_CONFIG` is a constant object that defines the default configuration settings for the Mermaid library. It includes settings for themes, log levels, security, and specific diagram types like flowcharts, sequences, and Gantt charts.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| DEFAULT_CONFIG | `MermaidConfig` | Default configuration for Mermaid diagrams. |

### `randomAlpha`
#### Description
Generates a random 6-character string composed of lowercase alphabetic characters. This string is used as a unique identifier for each Mermaid diagram rendered.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | `string` | A random 6-character string. |

#### Internal Logic
- Defines an alphabet string.
- Generates a random string by selecting random characters from the alphabet.

### `Mermaid`
#### Description
The `Mermaid` component is a React functional component that renders a Mermaid diagram. It initializes Mermaid with a configuration, adapts the theme based on the current application theme, and uses the `useAsyncData` hook to render the diagram as an SVG.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| diagram | `string` | The Mermaid diagram definition to be rendered. |
| config | `MermaidConfig` (optional) | Optional configuration to override the default settings. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | `JSX.Element` or `null` | A `div` containing the rendered SVG or `null` if rendering fails. |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `useState` to generate a unique ID for the diagram.
- Determines the current theme using `useTheme`.
- Initializes Mermaid with a configuration that merges `DEFAULT_CONFIG` with any provided configuration and the current theme.
- Uses `useAsyncData` to asynchronously render the diagram and handle errors.
- If rendering is successful, it returns a `div` with the SVG content; otherwise, it returns `null`.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the DOM by removing elements if rendering fails.
- Logs warnings using the `Logger` utility.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `React` | Used for creating the React component. |
| `mermaid` | Library for rendering diagrams. |
| `useAsyncData` | Custom hook for handling asynchronous data fetching. |
| `Logger` | Utility for logging warnings and errors. |
| `useTheme` | Hook for determining the current application theme. |

## Error Handling
- Uses a `catch` block to handle errors during the diagram rendering process. If an error occurs, it logs a warning and removes the failed diagram from the DOM.

## Logging
- Utilizes the `Logger` utility to log warnings when diagram rendering fails.
