## High-level description

The `RoutesPlugin` in the `RoutesPlugin.tsx` file is a React component designed to manage and render different routes within a web application. It uses a custom routing mechanism, `TinyRouter`, to match the current URL against a set of predefined routes and render the corresponding child component. This plugin is part of a larger plugin system and is used to dynamically display content based on the current route.

## Code Structure

- **RoutesPlugin**: Implements the `IStatelessPlugin` interface, providing a `render` method that returns a `RoutesComponent`.
- **RoutesComponent**: A functional React component that uses the `TinyRouter` to match the current location against the provided routes and renders the appropriate child component.

## References

- **TinyRouter**: A utility class used to match the current URL against a list of route templates.
- **IStatelessPlugin**: An interface defining the structure for stateless plugins, which `RoutesPlugin` implements.

## Symbols

### `RoutesPlugin`
#### Description
The `RoutesPlugin` class implements the `IStatelessPlugin` interface, providing a mechanism to render components based on the current route. It validates the input data using `zod` and renders the `RoutesComponent` with the provided data and children.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | `IStatelessPluginProps&lt;Data&gt;` | Contains the host element, plugin data, and children elements. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | `JSX.Element` | A React element representing the rendered routes. |

### `RoutesComponent`
#### Description
`RoutesComponent` is a React functional component that uses the `TinyRouter` to determine which child component to render based on the current URL. It ensures that the number of children matches the number of routes and updates the rendered component when the route changes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| routes | `string[]` | An array of route paths to match against the current URL. |
| children | `React.ReactNode` | The child components to render based on the matched route. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | `JSX.Element` | The matched child component or an empty fragment if no match is found. |

#### Internal Logic
- **Route Matching**: Uses `TinyRouter` to match the current location against the provided routes.
- **State Management**: Maintains the matched route in the component's state and updates it on route changes.
- **Event Handling**: Listens for `hashchange` and `popstate` events to update the matched route when the URL changes.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `React` | Used for creating React components and managing state. |
| `zod` | Used for validating the structure of the input data. |
| `TinyRouter` | A utility for matching routes against the current URL. |
| `useEvent` | A hook for creating stable event handlers. |

## Error Handling

- Throws an error if the number of children does not match the number of routes, ensuring that each route has a corresponding component to render.
