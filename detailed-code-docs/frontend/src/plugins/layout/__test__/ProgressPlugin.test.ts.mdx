## High-level description

The target file `ProgressPlugin.test.ts` contains unit tests for the `prettyTime` function, which is part of the `ProgressPlugin` module. The `prettyTime` function is designed to convert a given time in seconds into a human-readable string format, such as "1h, 30m" for 5400 seconds. The tests ensure that the function correctly formats various time values, including exact times, decimal times, and edge cases.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in the target file is the `test` function from the `vitest` library, which is used to define a series of test cases for the `prettyTime` function. The `prettyTime` function is imported from the `ProgressPlugin` module and is the primary focus of the tests.

## References

- `prettyTime`: This function is imported from the `ProgressPlugin` module and is the subject of the tests in the target file.

## Symbols

### `test`
#### Description
The `test` function is used to define a test suite for the `prettyTime` function. It contains multiple test cases that verify the correctness of the `prettyTime` function's output for different input values.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| description | string | A description of the test case. |
| callback | function | A function containing the test logic. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | None | The function does not return a value. |

#### Internal Logic
The `test` function uses the `expect` function to assert that the output of `prettyTime` matches the expected inline snapshot for various input values. The test cases cover exact times, decimal times, and edge cases to ensure comprehensive coverage.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `vitest` | Provides the testing framework used to define and run the test cases. |

## Error Handling

The test cases use the `expect` function to handle assertions. If the output of `prettyTime` does not match the expected snapshot, an error is thrown, indicating a test failure.

## Logging

There is no explicit logging in the test file. However, the `vitest` framework will output test results to the console, indicating whether each test case passed or failed.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
