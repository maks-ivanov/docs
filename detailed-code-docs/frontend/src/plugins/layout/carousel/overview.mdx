## High-level description

The `CarouselPlugin` in the target file is a React component designed to integrate a carousel feature into a web application. It implements the `IStatelessPlugin` interface, which allows it to be used as a stateless plugin within a larger plugin architecture. The plugin uses lazy loading to import a `LazySlidesComponent` for rendering the carousel, and it includes several CSS styles from the Swiper library to enhance its functionality.

## Code Structure

- **CarouselPlugin**: Implements the `IStatelessPlugin` interface, providing a `render` method to display the carousel.
- **LazySlidesComponent**: A lazily loaded React component that is used within the `CarouselPlugin` to render the carousel slides.

## References

- **IStatelessPlugin**: An interface from `stateless-plugin.ts` that `CarouselPlugin` implements.
- **LazySlidesComponent**: Imported lazily from `../../../components/slides/slides-component`.
- **Swiper CSS**: Multiple CSS files from the Swiper library are imported to style the carousel.

### `CarouselPlugin`
#### Description
The `CarouselPlugin` class is a stateless plugin that provides a carousel feature for a web application. It uses the Swiper library for styling and functionality and renders a lazily loaded component to display the carousel slides.

#### Internal Logic
- **Validator**: Uses `zod` to define a schema for the plugin data, which includes optional `index` and `height` properties.
- **CSS Styles**: Imports several CSS files from the Swiper library to style the carousel.
- **Render Method**: Uses `React.lazy` to import the `LazySlidesComponent` and renders it with the provided data and children.

## Side Effects
- The plugin imports and applies CSS styles from the Swiper library, which affects the global styling of the application.

## Dependencies

|:-----------|:--------|
| `zod` | Used for data validation. |
| `swiper/css` | Provides CSS styles for the carousel. |
