title: "RenderHTML.test.ts"

## High-level description

The target file `RenderHTML.test.ts` contains a suite of unit tests for the `renderHTML` function, which is defined in the related file `RenderHTML.tsx`. These tests are designed to verify that the `renderHTML` function correctly parses and renders HTML strings into React components, handling various cases such as valid and invalid HTML tags, scripts, iframes, and custom tags.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in the target file is the `describe` block, which groups related tests for the `renderHTML` function. Each `test` within the `describe` block checks a specific aspect of the `renderHTML` function's behavior. The `renderHTML` function itself is imported from the `RenderHTML.tsx` file, where it is defined to parse HTML strings and replace certain elements based on custom logic.

## References

- `renderHTML`: This function is imported from `RenderHTML.tsx` and is the primary focus of the tests in the target file.

## Symbols

### `describe("RenderHTML", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This `describe` block contains a series of tests that verify the behavior of the `renderHTML` function when rendering various HTML strings. It checks how the function handles standard HTML tags, scripts, iframes, and custom tags, both valid and invalid.

#### Internal Logic
- **Test "renders HTML"**: Verifies that a simple HTML string is rendered correctly.
- **Test "no closing HTML"**: Checks if the function can handle HTML strings without closing tags.
- **Test "script"**: Ensures that script tags are handled with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
- **Test "iframe"**: Confirms that iframes are rendered using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
- **Test "custom tags - valid"**: Tests rendering of valid custom HTML tags.
- **Test "custom tags - invalid"**: Tests handling of invalid custom HTML tags, ensuring they are not rendered.

### `describe("RenderHTML with &lt; nad &gt;", () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This `describe` block tests the `renderHTML` function's ability to handle HTML strings containing angle brackets (`&lt;` and `&gt;`), which are often used in custom tags or as part of text content.

#### Internal Logic
- **Test "&lt;unnamed&gt;"**: Checks if a custom tag with angle brackets is rendered correctly.
- **Test "&lt;unnamed&gt; sanitized"**: Verifies that the function can handle sanitized HTML strings where angle brackets are replaced with their HTML entity equivalents.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `vitest`   | Used for writing and running the unit tests. |

## Error Handling

The tests do not explicitly handle errors, as they rely on the `expect` function from `vitest` to assert the expected outcomes. If the `renderHTML` function does not behave as expected, the test framework will report a failure.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in the test file. The focus is on verifying the output of the `renderHTML` function through assertions.

## API/Interface Reference

The `renderHTML` function is the primary interface being tested. It takes an object with an `html` string and an optional `additionalReplacements` array as input and returns a React component representation of the parsed HTML.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code. The test suite appears to be complete for the current scope of functionality being tested.
