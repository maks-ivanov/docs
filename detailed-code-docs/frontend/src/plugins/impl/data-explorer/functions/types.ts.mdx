## High-level description

The target file `types.ts` defines TypeScript types for various operations and functions that can be applied to data fields within a data exploration tool. These types include aggregate operations, time unit operations, and a combined type for field functions. The purpose of these types is to provide a structured way to specify and validate the operations that can be performed on data fields in the context of data visualization or analysis.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are TypeScript type definitions. These types are used to categorize and constrain the kinds of operations that can be applied to data fields. The `AggregateOp` type defines a set of string literals representing aggregate operations, while the `TimeUnitOp` type defines string literals for time unit operations. The `FieldFunction` type is a union of `AggregateOp`, a string literal `"bin"`, and `TimeUnitOp`, allowing it to represent any of these operations.

## Symbols

### `AggregateOp`
#### Description
`AggregateOp` is a TypeScript type that defines a set of string literals representing aggregate operations that can be applied to data fields. These operations include statistical and mathematical functions such as "average", "count", "sum", etc.

#### Inputs
This is a type definition and does not take inputs.

#### Outputs
This is a type definition and does not produce outputs.

### `TimeUnitOp`
#### Description
`TimeUnitOp` is a TypeScript type that defines a set of string literals representing time unit operations. These operations are used to manipulate or extract specific time components from date-time data, such as "year", "month", "day", etc.

#### Inputs
This is a type definition and does not take inputs.

#### Outputs
This is a type definition and does not produce outputs.

### `FieldFunction`
#### Description
`FieldFunction` is a TypeScript type that is a union of `AggregateOp`, the string literal `"bin"`, and `TimeUnitOp`. It represents any function that can be applied to a data field, including both aggregate and time unit operations, as well as binning.

#### Inputs
This is a type definition and does not take inputs.

#### Outputs
This is a type definition and does not produce outputs.

## References

- The `FieldFunction` type is referenced in the related file `query-form.tsx`, where it is used to define the type of functions that can be applied to fields in a data query form.
- The `FieldFunction` type is also used in `encoding.ts` to define the `fn` property of the `FieldDefinition` interface, which specifies the function applied to a field.

## Dependencies

There are no external dependencies in this file. The file solely defines TypeScript types.

## Error Handling

There is no error handling in this file as it only contains type definitions.

## Logging

There is no logging in this file as it only contains type definitions.

## API/Interface Reference

This file does not define an API or public interface directly. It provides type definitions that are used by other parts of the codebase to ensure type safety and consistency in function application to data fields.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
