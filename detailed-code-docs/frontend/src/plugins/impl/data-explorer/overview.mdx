## High-level description

The `data-explorer` directory is part of a frontend codebase for a data visualization tool. It provides a comprehensive suite of components, utilities, and state management functionalities to facilitate interactive data exploration and visualization. The directory is structured to support the creation, management, and rendering of data visualizations using the CompassQL and Vega-Lite libraries. It includes components for configuring chart specifications, managing state, handling data encoding, and rendering visualizations with tooltips and responsive designs.

## What does it do?

The `data-explorer` directory enables users to explore and visualize data interactively. It provides a user interface for summarizing data columns, configuring chart specifications, and rendering visualizations. Users can load data asynchronously, manage chart specifications, and explore related visualizations through a responsive interface. The tool supports various data operations, such as aggregation, time unit manipulation, and binning, allowing users to transform and summarize data fields for meaningful visualizations. The directory also includes utilities for managing queries, suggesting fields for visualizations, and converting chart specifications into query formats compatible with CompassQL.

### Key Functionalities:

- **Data Loading and Visualization**: Users can load data asynchronously and visualize it using Vega-Lite specifications. The tool handles errors gracefully and provides a responsive interface for data exploration.

- **Chart Configuration**: Users can configure chart specifications by selecting encoding channels, marks, and data fields. The tool supports various operations like aggregation and time unit manipulation to tailor visualizations to user needs.

- **State Management**: The tool uses Jotai for managing the state of chart specifications, allowing reactive updates and exploration of related visualizations based on the current state and query conditions.

- **Query Management**: The tool provides mechanisms to create, manipulate, and transform queries into visualizable chart specifications. It suggests additional fields for visualizations and generates histogram queries.

- **Tooltip and Icon Support**: The tool enhances user interaction with tooltips and visual cues through icons, making the interface intuitive and visually appealing.

Overall, the `data-explorer` directory is designed to provide a robust and flexible platform for data visualization, enabling users to explore data interactively and derive insights through customized visualizations.
