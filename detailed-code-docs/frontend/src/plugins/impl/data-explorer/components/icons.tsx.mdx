title: "icons.tsx"

## High-level description

The target file, `icons.tsx`, is a React component module that maps different data types, represented by `PrimitiveType` from the `compassql` library, to corresponding icons from the `lucide-react` icon library. This mapping is used to visually represent different data types in a user interface, enhancing the user experience by providing intuitive visual cues.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in this file is the `PRIMITIVE_TYPE_ICON` object, which is a mapping between `PrimitiveType` values and React components representing icons. This object is used in other components to render the appropriate icon based on the data type.

## References

- `PrimitiveType` from `compassql/build/src/schema`: This is an enumeration of data types that the icons are mapped to.
- Icons from `lucide-react`: These are the visual representations used for each data type.

## Symbols

### `PRIMITIVE_TYPE_ICON`
#### Description
The `PRIMITIVE_TYPE_ICON` is an object that maps each `PrimitiveType` to a corresponding React component that renders an icon. This mapping is used to display icons that represent different data types in a user interface.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| PrimitiveType | Enum | Represents the data type for which an icon is needed. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| React.ReactNode | React Component | A React component that renders the icon for the specified data type. |

#### Internal Logic
The `PRIMITIVE_TYPE_ICON` object uses the `PrimitiveType` enum as keys and assigns each key a React component from the `lucide-react` library. Each icon component is styled with specific classes to maintain a consistent appearance across the application.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `compassql/build/src/schema` | Provides the `PrimitiveType` enum used for mapping. |
| `lucide-react` | Supplies the icon components used in the mapping. |

## Usage

The `PRIMITIVE_TYPE_ICON` object is used in other components, such as the `QueryForm` component in `query-form.tsx`, to render icons based on the data type of fields. This enhances the user interface by providing visual cues that help users quickly identify the type of data they are working with.

## Error Handling

There is no explicit error handling in this file, as it primarily deals with static mappings. Any issues would likely arise from incorrect usage of the `PrimitiveType` keys or the icon components.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in this file.

## API/Interface Reference

This file does not expose an API or public interface directly. It provides a utility object that is used internally by other components in the application.
