## High-level description

The target file, `marks.ts`, defines a type and a constant related to chart marks used in a data visualization context. It imports types from the `compassql` library to define a `SpecMark` type, which can be either a specific mark type or a wildcard. The file also exports a constant array `MARKS` that lists all possible mark types, including a wildcard, which can be used in chart specifications.

## Code Structure

- **`SpecMark` Type**: This type is defined as a union of a specific mark type from `SpecQuery["mark"]` and a wildcard type from `SHORT_WILDCARD`.
- **`MARKS` Constant**: An array of possible mark types, including a wildcard, which is used to specify the type of visual representation in a chart.

## References

- **`SpecQuery`**: Imported from `compassql`, it provides the structure for a specification query, including mark types.
- **`SHORT_WILDCARD`**: Also from `compassql`, it represents a wildcard that can be used in place of a specific mark type.

## Symbols

### `SpecMark`
#### Description
`SpecMark` is a type that represents the possible values for a chart's mark type. It can be a specific mark type defined in `SpecQuery` or a wildcard represented by `SHORT_WILDCARD`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | N/A         |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | N/A         |

### `MARKS`
#### Description
`MARKS` is a constant array that lists all possible mark types that can be used in a chart specification. It includes specific mark types like "area", "bar", "circle", etc., and a wildcard.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | N/A         |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | N/A         |

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `compassql` | Provides types and constants for defining chart specifications, including `SpecQuery` and `SHORT_WILDCARD`. |

## Error Handling

The target file does not implement any specific error handling mechanisms. It primarily defines types and constants.

## Logging

There are no logging mechanisms implemented in the target file.

## API/Interface Reference

The target file does not define an API or public interface. It provides types and constants for use in other parts of the application.

## Side Effects

There are no side effects in the target file. It only exports types and constants.

## Performance Considerations

The target file does not have any performance-critical sections, as it only defines types and constants.
