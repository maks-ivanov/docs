## High-level description

The `DataExplorerPlugin.tsx` file defines a React plugin for a data exploration tool within a larger application. It utilizes a lazy-loaded component to render data visualizations and provides a tooltip interface for enhanced user interaction. The plugin is built using a structured pattern that includes data validation and rendering logic, making it a modular and reusable component within the application's plugin architecture.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are interconnected as follows:
- `DataExplorerPlugin`: The primary export of the file, created using the `createPlugin` function. It defines the plugin's data schema and rendering logic.
- `LazyDataExplorerComponent`: A lazily loaded React component that is rendered by the `DataExplorerPlugin`.
- `TooltipProvider`: A component that wraps the `LazyDataExplorerComponent` to provide tooltip functionality.

## Symbols

### `DataExplorerPlugin`
#### Description
The `DataExplorerPlugin` is a plugin for exploring data, created using a builder pattern. It defines a data schema and a renderer function that utilizes a lazily loaded component to display data visualizations with tooltip support.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | `IPluginProps&lt;DataExplorerState, { label?: string | null; data: string; }, unknown&gt;` | The properties passed to the renderer, including data and state. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | `JSX.Element` | A React element that renders the data explorer component with tooltips. |

#### Internal Logic
- The plugin is created using the `createPlugin` function, specifying a tag name and a data schema using `zod` for validation.
- The `renderer` function is defined to render the `LazyDataExplorerComponent` within a `TooltipProvider`, passing necessary props for data and state management.

## References

- `createPlugin`: A function from the `core/builder` module used to create the plugin with a specified data schema and renderer.
- `TooltipProvider`: Imported from the `ui/tooltip` module, used to provide tooltip functionality around the data explorer component.
- `LazyDataExplorerComponent`: A lazily loaded component that is the main visual element of the plugin, imported from `ConnectedDataExplorerComponent`.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `zod` | Used for defining and validating the data schema for the plugin. |
| `React` | Provides the base for creating React components and lazy loading. |
| `TooltipProvider` | Provides tooltip functionality to enhance user interaction. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors within the `DataExplorerPlugin` itself, but relies on the `ConnectedDataExplorerComponent` to manage any errors related to data loading or rendering.

## Logging

There is no explicit logging implemented in this code.

## API/Interface Reference

The `DataExplorerPlugin` does not expose an API directly but is part of a larger plugin system where it can be registered and used within the application. It interacts with the application through the plugin architecture defined in the `core/builder` module.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
