## High-level description

The directory `frontend/src/plugins/impl/data-frames/utils/__tests__/` contains unit tests for utility functions related to data frames. These tests are crucial for ensuring the correctness of operations that manipulate data frames, such as updating column types and handling data type operators. The main components within this directory are test files that validate the behavior of specific functions used in data frame transformations and operations.

## What does it do?

The tests in this directory verify the functionality of utility functions that are essential for data frame operations. Specifically, they ensure that:

1. **Column Type Updates**: The `getUpdatedColumnTypes` function correctly updates the data types of columns in a data frame when various transformations are applied. These transformations can include operations like converting column types, renaming columns, grouping, aggregating, and selecting specific columns. The tests simulate these operations and check that the resulting column types are as expected.

2. **Data Type Operators**: The utility functions related to data type operators are tested to ensure they behave correctly. These functions determine which operators are applicable to different data types, retrieve schemas for operators, and validate condition values against these schemas. The tests cover a range of data types and operators, ensuring that the functions return the correct operators and schemas, and validate values accurately.

## Entry points

The directory contains multiple test files, each focusing on a specific aspect of data frame utilities:

- **`getUpdatedColumnTypes.test.ts`**: This file is the entry point for testing the `getUpdatedColumnTypes` function. It organizes test cases to verify that column types are updated correctly based on a series of transformations.

- **`operators.test.ts`**: This file serves as the entry point for testing utility functions related to data type operators. It includes test cases for functions that determine applicable operators, retrieve operator schemas, and validate condition values.

## Dependencies

The tests in this directory rely on the `vitest` library, which provides a framework for writing and executing unit tests. This library is chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in handling JavaScript and TypeScript test cases, allowing developers to define test suites, individual test cases, and assertions to verify expected outcomes.
