## High-level description

The target file contains unit tests for utility functions related to data type operators in a data frame context. These tests ensure that the functions `getOperatorForDtype`, `getSchemaForOperator`, and `isConditionValueValid` behave correctly when determining applicable operators for different data types, retrieving schemas for operators, and validating condition values against operator schemas, respectively.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the test cases organized under the `describe` blocks for each function being tested. Each `describe` block contains multiple `it` blocks, which are individual test cases that verify specific behaviors of the functions. The functions being tested are imported from the `operators` module, which defines the logic for handling operators based on data types.

## References

The target file references the following functions and constants from the `operators` module:

- `getOperatorForDtype`
- `getSchemaForOperator`
- `isConditionValueValid`
- `BOOLEAN_OPERATORS`
- `DATE_OPERATORS`
- `NUMERIC_OPERATORS`
- `STRING_OPERATORS`

## Symbols

### `describe("getOperatorForDtype")`
#### Description
Tests the `getOperatorForDtype` function to ensure it returns the correct set of operators for a given data type.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dtype | string | The data type for which operators are being retrieved. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| operators | array | An array of operator keys applicable to the given data type. |

#### Internal Logic
The test cases check various data types such as "bool", "int", "float", "datetime64[ns]", "object", and "unknown" to verify that the correct operator keys are returned.

### `describe("getSchemaForOperator")`
#### Description
Tests the `getSchemaForOperator` function to ensure it returns the correct schema for a given data type and operator.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dtype | string | The data type for which the schema is being retrieved. |
| operator | string | The operator for which the schema is being retrieved. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| schema | array | An array containing the schema for the given operator, or an empty array if not found. |

#### Internal Logic
The test cases verify that the function returns the correct schema for combinations of data types and operators, and returns an empty array for unknown types or operators.

### `describe("isConditionValueValid")`
#### Description
Tests the `isConditionValueValid` function to ensure it correctly validates values against the schema for a given operator.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| operator | string | The operator for which the value is being validated. |
| value | unknown | The value to be validated against the operator's schema. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| isValid | boolean | Indicates whether the value is valid according to the operator's schema. |

#### Internal Logic
The test cases check various operators and values to ensure the function returns `true` for valid combinations and `false` for invalid ones. It also checks that operators not requiring a value return `true`.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `vitest` | Used for writing and running unit tests. |

## Error Handling

The test cases implicitly handle errors by using assertions to verify expected outcomes. If a function does not behave as expected, the test will fail, indicating an error in the logic.

## Logging

No explicit logging is implemented in the test file. The test framework (`vitest`) handles output and reporting of test results.

## TODOs

No TODOs or notes are present in the code.
