## High-level description

The target file defines an interface `FieldOptions` and a utility object `FieldOptions` for handling form field options in a TypeScript application. It also includes a utility function `randomNumber` that generates a random number between 0 and 100,000. The `FieldOptions` interface specifies various properties that can be used to configure form fields, such as labels, descriptions, and special types. The utility object provides methods to serialize and deserialize these options.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `FieldOptions` interface and the `FieldOptions` object, which provides methods for working with instances of the `FieldOptions` interface. The `randomNumber` function is a standalone utility function.

## Symbols

### `FieldOptions` (Interface)
#### Description
The `FieldOptions` interface defines a set of optional properties that can be used to configure form fields. These properties include visual and functional attributes such as labels, descriptions, placeholders, and special types.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| label | string | The label for the form field. |
| description | string | A description for the form field. |
| placeholder | string | Placeholder text for the form field. |
| disabled | boolean | Indicates if the form field is disabled. |
| hidden | boolean | Indicates if the form field is hidden. |
| direction | "row" \| "column" | Layout direction for the form field. |
| special | string | Special type identifier for the form field. |

#### Outputs
N/A

### `FieldOptions` (Object)
#### Description
The `FieldOptions` object provides utility methods for serializing and deserializing `FieldOptions` instances. It includes methods to convert `FieldOptions` to a JSON string and to parse a JSON string back into a `FieldOptions` object.

#### Methods

- **of(options: FieldOptions): string**
  - Converts a `FieldOptions` object into a JSON string.
  
  #### Inputs
  | Name | Type | Description |
  |:-----|:-----|:------------|
  | options | FieldOptions | The field options to serialize. |

  #### Outputs
  | Name | Type | Description |
  |:-----|:-----|:------------|
  | JSON string | string | The serialized JSON string of the field options. |

- **parse(options: string | undefined): FieldOptions**
  - Parses a JSON string into a `FieldOptions` object. If parsing fails, it returns an object with the `label` set to the input string.

  #### Inputs
  | Name | Type | Description |
  |:-----|:-----|:------------|
  | options | string \| undefined | The JSON string to parse. |

  #### Outputs
  | Name | Type | Description |
  |:-----|:-----|:------------|
  | FieldOptions | FieldOptions | The parsed field options object. |

  #### Internal Logic
  - If the input is undefined, it returns an empty object.
  - Attempts to parse the input string as JSON.
  - If parsing fails, it returns an object with the `label` property set to the input string.

### `randomNumber`
#### Description
Generates a random integer between 0 and 100,000.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Random number | number | A random integer between 0 and 100,000. |

## References

- The `FieldOptions` interface and object are referenced in other parts of the codebase, such as in form schemas and utilities, to define and manipulate form field configurations.
- The `randomNumber` function is used in related files to provide random number functionality, particularly in form-related operations.

## Dependencies

No external libraries or modules are directly used in the target file. However, the `FieldOptions` and `randomNumber` are utilized in other parts of the codebase, as seen in the related files.

## Error Handling

The `parse` method in the `FieldOptions` object includes basic error handling by catching JSON parsing errors and returning a default object with the `label` set to the input string.

## Logging

No logging mechanisms are implemented in the target file.

## TODOs

No TODOs or notes are present in the target file.
