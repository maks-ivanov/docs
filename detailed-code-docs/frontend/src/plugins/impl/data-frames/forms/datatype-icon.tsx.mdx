---

## High-level description
The `datatype-icon.tsx` file defines a React functional component named `DataTypeIcon` that renders an icon based on the data type provided as a prop. It uses a set of predefined icons from the `lucide-react` library to visually represent different data types such as integers, floats, strings, dates, and booleans.

## Code Structure
The main symbol in this code is the `DataTypeIcon` component, which utilizes a helper function `renderIcon` to determine which icon to display based on the `type` prop. The component is structured to be reusable and easily integrated into other parts of a React application.

## Symbols

### `DataTypeIcon`
#### Description
The `DataTypeIcon` component is a React functional component that takes a `type` prop and renders an appropriate icon to represent the data type. It uses a series of conditional checks to determine which icon to display, providing a visual cue for the data type.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type   | Description          |
|:-----|:-------|:---------------------|
| type | string | The data type string that determines which icon to render. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type   | Description          |
|:-----|:-------|:---------------------|
| -    | JSX.Element | A JSX element containing the icon that represents the data type. |

#### Internal Logic
- The `renderIcon` function is defined within the component to encapsulate the logic for selecting the appropriate icon.
- It checks the beginning of the `type` string against several known prefixes (e.g., "int", "float", "string") to determine the data type.
- Depending on the prefix, it returns a corresponding icon component from the `lucide-react` library, each with a size of 14.
- If none of the specific prefixes match, a default `BracesIcon` is returned.

## Dependencies
| Dependency   | Purpose                                                                 |
|:-------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `lucide-react` | Provides the icon components used to visually represent different data types. |
| `React`      | Used to create the functional component and manage JSX rendering.       |

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the `type` prop will be a valid string that matches one of the expected prefixes.

## Logging
The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## Side Effects
There are no side effects in this component. It purely renders a visual element based on the input prop.

## Performance Considerations
The component is lightweight and performs a simple string check to determine which icon to render. It is optimized for quick rendering and minimal computational overhead.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
