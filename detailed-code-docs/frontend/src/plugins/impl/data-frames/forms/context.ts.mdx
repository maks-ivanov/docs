## High-level description

The target file defines three React context objects used in a data frame management system. These contexts are designed to provide shared state and functionality related to column information, column names, and fetching column values across different components in a React application. The contexts facilitate the management of column data types, column names, and asynchronous fetching of column values.

## Code Structure

The code consists of three main symbols, each representing a React context:

1. `ColumnInfoContext`: Provides a shared state for column data types.
2. `ColumnNameContext`: Provides a shared state for column names.
3. `ColumnFetchValuesContext`: Provides a shared function for fetching column values asynchronously.

These contexts are used in conjunction with each other to manage and manipulate data frame columns within the application.

## Symbols

### `ColumnInfoContext`
#### Description
`ColumnInfoContext` is a React context that holds a map of column identifiers to their respective data types. It is used to share column data type information across components.

#### Inputs
- None directly, but it is initialized with a `Map` of column data types.

#### Outputs
- Provides access to the column data types map to any component that consumes this context.

### `ColumnNameContext`
#### Description
`ColumnNameContext` is a React context that holds the name of a column as a string. It is used to share the current column name across components.

#### Inputs
- None directly, but it is initialized with an empty string.

#### Outputs
- Provides access to the column name to any component that consumes this context.

### `ColumnFetchValuesContext`
#### Description
`ColumnFetchValuesContext` is a React context that holds a function for fetching column values asynchronously. It is used to share a method for retrieving column values, which returns a promise resolving to an object containing the values and a flag indicating if there are too many values.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| req | object | An object containing the column name for which values are to be fetched. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise | Promise | Resolves to an object with `values` (an array of unknowns) and `too_many_values` (a boolean). |

#### Internal Logic
The context is initialized with a default function that returns a resolved promise with an empty array of values and a `too_many_values` flag set to `false`.

## References

- `ColumnDataTypes`: This type is imported from `../types` and is used to define the type of the map in `ColumnInfoContext`.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `react` | Provides the `createContext` function to create React contexts. |

## Error Handling

There is no explicit error handling in the target file, as the contexts are initialized with default values and functions that do not throw errors.

## Logging

The target file does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The target file does not expose any API endpoints or interfaces directly. It provides contexts that are used internally within the React application.
