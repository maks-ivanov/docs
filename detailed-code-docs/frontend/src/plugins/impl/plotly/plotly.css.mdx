## High-level description

The `plotly.css` file is a CSS stylesheet specifically tailored for styling Plotly.js visualizations within a web application. It defines various styles for Plotly components, such as plots, mode bars, tooltips, and cursors, ensuring consistent appearance and behavior across different browsers and devices. The styles are generated from a SCSS file and include customizations for user interactions and visual elements.

## Code Structure

The CSS file is structured to apply styles to elements within a Plotly plot, identified by the `.js-plotly-plot .plotly` class selector. It includes styles for various HTML elements like `div`, `input`, `button`, `a`, `svg`, and custom classes like `.modebar`, `.cursor-*`, and `.plotly-notifier`. These styles are organized to handle layout, typography, user interactions, and visual effects.
