## High-level description

The `labeled.tsx` file defines a React functional component named `Labeled`. This component is designed to wrap other components with a label, providing a consistent way to display labels alongside various UI elements. It supports different alignment options for the label and can handle cases where the label is not provided.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in this file is the `Labeled` component, which is a React functional component. It utilizes several imported utilities and components, such as `Label` from the UI components, `renderHTML` for rendering HTML content within labels, and `cn` for class name management. The `Labeled` component is designed to be flexible, allowing for different label alignments and optional full-width display.

## Symbols

### `Labeled`
#### Description
The `Labeled` component is a React functional component that wraps its children with a label. It provides options for label alignment (top, left, or right) and can render the label as HTML content. The component also supports full-width display, which forces the label to align at the top.

#### Inputs
| Name          | Type                | Description                                      |
|:--------------|:--------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| `label`       | `string \| null \| undefined` | The text or HTML content for the label.          |
| `children`    | `React.ReactNode`   | The child components to be wrapped by the label. |
| `align`       | `"top" \| "left" \| "right"` | The alignment of the label relative to the children. Defaults to "left". |
| `className`   | `string`            | Additional CSS classes for the container.        |
| `labelClassName` | `string`         | Additional CSS classes for the label.            |
| `fullWidth`   | `boolean`           | If true, forces the label to align at the top.   |
| `id`          | `string`            | The ID for the label, used for accessibility.    |

#### Outputs
| Name     | Type              | Description                                      |
|:---------|:------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| `output` | `JSX.Element`     | A JSX element containing the label and children. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Full Width Handling**: If `fullWidth` is true, the label alignment is forced to "top".
2. **Label Absence**: If no label is provided, the component returns the children directly. If the alignment is "top", it returns the children as is; otherwise, it wraps them in an `inline-flex` container.
3. **Label Rendering**: If a label is provided, it is rendered using the `Label` component, with HTML content processed by `renderHTML`.
4. **Container Structure**: The component returns a `div` that wraps the label and children, with class names determined by the alignment and other props.
