## High-level description

The directory contains React components and TypeScript types that are part of a frontend plugin implementation. These components and types are designed to enhance user interface elements by providing error handling, labeling, and intent categorization functionalities. The main components include an `ErrorBanner` for displaying error messages, a `Labeled` component for wrapping UI elements with labels, and a TypeScript type `Intent` for categorizing different states or messages.

## What does it do?

The components and types in this directory are used to improve the user experience by providing structured and consistent ways to display information and handle errors. 

- **Error Handling**: The `ErrorBanner` component is used to display error messages in a user-friendly manner. It shows a brief error message in a banner format and allows users to click on it to view more detailed information in a modal dialog. This helps users understand what went wrong and how to address it.

- **Labeling**: The `Labeled` component wraps other UI elements with a label, ensuring that labels are consistently displayed alongside form fields or other components. It supports different label alignments and can render labels as HTML content, making it versatile for various UI designs.

- **Intent Categorization**: The `Intent` type and its associated Zod schema (`zodIntent`) are used to categorize different states or messages, such as "success", "warn", or "danger". This categorization helps in applying consistent styling and behavior across different components that use these intents.

## Entry points

The main files in this directory are:

- **`error-banner.tsx`**: Defines the `ErrorBanner` component, which is responsible for displaying error messages and handling user interactions to show detailed error information.

- **`labeled.tsx`**: Contains the `Labeled` component, which wraps UI elements with a label and supports various alignment options.

- **`intent.ts`**: Defines the `Intent` type and `zodIntent` schema for categorizing and validating different states or message types.

These files are organized to provide specific functionalities, with `error-banner.tsx` and `labeled.tsx` focusing on UI components, while `intent.ts` provides type definitions and validation logic.

## Dependencies

The directory uses several external libraries and utilities to enhance its functionality:

- **`class-variance-authority`**: Used in the `ErrorBanner` component to manage styling variants, allowing for customizable and consistent styling of UI elements.

- **`zod`**: Utilized in `intent.ts` to create a schema for validating and defaulting values of the `Intent` type, ensuring that only specified values are allowed.

- **`@/utils/errors`**: Provides the `prettyError` function for formatting error messages in the `ErrorBanner` component.

- **`@/utils/Logger`**: Used in the `ErrorBanner` component for logging errors, aiding in debugging and error tracking.

- **`@/components/ui/alert-dialog`**: Supplies components for creating modal dialogs, used in the `ErrorBanner` to display detailed error information.

- **`@/utils/cn`**: A utility for merging CSS class names, used in both `ErrorBanner` and `Labeled` components to manage styling.

- **`@/components/ui/label`**: Provides the `Label` component used in `labeled.tsx` to render labels alongside UI elements.

- **`@/plugins/core/RenderHTML`**: Offers the `renderHTML` utility for safely rendering HTML content within labels in the `Labeled` component.
