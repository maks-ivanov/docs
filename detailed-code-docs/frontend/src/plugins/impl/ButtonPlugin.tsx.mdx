## High-level description

The `ButtonPlugin` class in the `ButtonPlugin.tsx` file is a React component that implements a customizable button plugin for a UI framework. It uses the `zod` library for data validation and supports features like different button intents, full-width display, and optional tooltips. The button's appearance and behavior are determined by the provided data, and it tracks the number of times it has been clicked.

## Code Structure

The `ButtonPlugin` class implements the `IPlugin` interface, which defines the structure and behavior of a plugin. It uses several imported components and utilities, such as `Button`, `Tooltip`, and `cn`, to render the button and manage its styles and interactions. The `kindToButtonVariant` function maps the button's intent to a specific variant style.

## Symbols

### `ButtonPlugin`
#### Description
The `ButtonPlugin` class is a React component that renders a button with customizable properties such as label, intent, disabled state, full-width option, and an optional tooltip. It tracks the number of times the button is clicked and updates its state accordingly.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | `IPluginProps&lt;number, Data&gt;` | The properties for the plugin, including state, data, and functions. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | `JSX.Element` | The rendered button element, optionally wrapped in a tooltip. |

#### Internal Logic
- The `render` method extracts properties from `props.data` and uses them to configure the button.
- The button's variant is determined by the `kindToButtonVariant` function, which maps the `kind` property to a specific style.
- The button's click event handler increments the click count unless the button is disabled.
- If a tooltip is provided, the button is wrapped in a `Tooltip` component.

### `kindToButtonVariant`
#### Description
This function maps the `Intent` type to a corresponding button variant string, which is used to style the button.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| kind | `Intent` | The intent of the button, which determines its style. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| variant | `string` | The variant string corresponding to the button's intent. |

#### Internal Logic
- The function uses a switch statement to return a specific variant string based on the `kind` value.

## Error Handling

The `ButtonPlugin` class relies on `zod` for data validation, ensuring that the input data conforms to the expected schema. This helps prevent runtime errors due to invalid data.
