## High-level description

The target file `MultiSelectPlugin.test.ts` contains unit tests for the `multiselectFilterFn` function, which is part of the `MultiselectPlugin` implementation. This function is responsible for filtering options in a multi-select component based on a search query. The tests ensure that the filtering logic correctly identifies relevant options according to the specified search criteria.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `filterOptions` function and the `it` test case. The `filterOptions` function utilizes the `multiselectFilterFn` from the `MultiselectPlugin` to filter a list of options based on a given filter string. The `it` test case contains multiple assertions to verify the correctness of the filtering logic.

## References

- `multiselectFilterFn`: This function is imported from the `MultiselectPlugin` and is the core logic being tested in this file.

## Symbols

### `filterOptions`
#### Description
The `filterOptions` function filters a list of string options based on a provided filter string. It uses the `multiselectFilterFn` to determine if an option should be included in the filtered results.

#### Inputs
| Name   | Type     | Description                        |
|:-------|:---------|:-----------------------------------|
| filter | string   | The filter string to match against. |
| items  | string[] | The list of options to filter.      |

#### Outputs
| Name   | Type     | Description                                      |
|:-------|:---------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| result | string[] | A list of options that match the filter criteria. |

#### Internal Logic
The function iterates over the `items` array and applies the `multiselectFilterFn` to each option, using the `filter` string. It returns a new array containing only the options for which `multiselectFilterFn` returns `1`.

### `it("can filter to relevant words")`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the `filterOptions` function correctly filters a predefined list of options based on various filter strings. It uses the `expect` function from the `vitest` testing library to assert that the output of `filterOptions` matches the expected results for each test scenario.

#### Inputs
The test case does not take inputs in the traditional sense but uses hardcoded values within the test.

#### Outputs
The test case does not produce outputs but will pass or fail based on the correctness of the `filterOptions` function.

#### Internal Logic
The test case defines a list of options and a series of filter strings. For each filter string, it calls `filterOptions` and uses `expect` to assert that the result matches the expected list of options.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose                                      |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------------|
| `vitest`   | Provides the testing framework and assertion library used to define and run the test cases. |

## Error Handling

The test file does not include explicit error handling, as it relies on the `vitest` framework to handle any exceptions or assertion failures that occur during the test execution.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in this test file. The focus is on verifying the correctness of the filtering logic through assertions.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
