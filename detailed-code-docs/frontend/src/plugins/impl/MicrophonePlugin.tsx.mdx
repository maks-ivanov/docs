## High-level description

The `MicrophonePlugin.tsx` file defines a React component that integrates a microphone recording feature into a web application. It utilizes a custom hook to manage audio recording, converts the recorded audio into a Base64 string, and provides a user interface for starting, stopping, and pausing the recording process.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `MicrophonePlugin` class and the `Microphone` functional component. The `MicrophonePlugin` class implements the `IPlugin` interface, which defines the structure and behavior of a plugin, including rendering logic. The `Microphone` component handles the user interface and interaction logic, utilizing the `useAudioRecorder` hook to manage the recording process and the `AudioRecorder` component to provide UI controls.

## Symbols

### `MicrophonePlugin`
#### Description
The `MicrophonePlugin` class implements the `IPlugin` interface, providing a plugin that allows users to record audio through their microphone. It defines the plugin's tag name, data validation schema, and rendering logic.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | `IPluginProps&lt;Value, Data&gt;` | The properties passed to the plugin, including state management and data. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | `JSX.Element` | The rendered JSX element for the microphone plugin. |

### `Microphone`
#### Description
The `Microphone` component is a functional React component that provides the user interface for the microphone plugin. It manages the recording process using the `useAudioRecorder` hook and displays controls for starting, stopping, and pausing the recording.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| setValue | `Setter&lt;Value&gt;` | Function to update the recorded audio value. |
| data | `Data` | Data object containing optional label information. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | `JSX.Element` | The rendered JSX element for the microphone component. |

#### Internal Logic
- The component uses the `useAudioRecorder` hook to manage the recording state and actions.
- It checks if microphone access is allowed and displays a warning message if not.
- It renders the `AudioRecorder` component, passing the necessary control functions and recording status.

## References

- `useAudioRecorder`: A custom hook used to manage audio recording, including starting, stopping, and pausing the recording.
- `AudioRecorder`: A component that provides UI controls for audio recording.
- `blobToBase64`: A utility function that converts a Blob object to a Base64-encoded string.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `zod` | Used for data validation within the plugin. |
| `useAudioRecorder` | Manages the audio recording process. |
| `AudioRecorder` | Provides UI controls for recording. |
| `blobToBase64` | Converts audio Blob to Base64 string. |

## Error Handling

- The `useAudioRecorder` hook handles errors related to microphone access by logging the error and setting the `allowed` state to `false`.

## Logging

- The `useAudioRecorder` hook uses a `Logger` utility to log errors when microphone access is denied.

## Side Effects

- The `Microphone` component may modify the state of the application by updating the recorded audio value using the `setValue` function.

## Performance Considerations

- The conversion of audio data to Base64 using `blobToBase64` can be resource-intensive, especially for long recordings. It is performed asynchronously to avoid blocking the main thread.
