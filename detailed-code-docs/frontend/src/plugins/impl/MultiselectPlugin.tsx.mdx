## High-level description

The `MultiselectPlugin.tsx` file defines a `MultiselectPlugin` class that implements a multi-select dropdown component for a frontend application. This component allows users to select multiple options from a list, with features such as search filtering and list virtualization for performance optimization when dealing with large datasets. The plugin is designed to be integrated into a larger UI framework, as indicated by its implementation of the `IPlugin` interface.

## Code Structure

- **MultiselectPlugin**: A class implementing the `IPlugin` interface, responsible for rendering the multi-select component.
- **Multiselect**: A functional React component that provides the UI and logic for the multi-select dropdown.
- **multiselectFilterFn**: A custom filter function used to determine the relevance of options based on a search query.

## References

- **IPlugin, IPluginProps, Setter**: Interfaces imported from `../types`, which define the structure and behavior expected from plugins.
- **Combobox, ComboboxItem**: UI components imported from `../../components/ui/combobox`, used to render the dropdown and its items.
- **Labeled**: A component imported from `./common/labeled`, used to wrap the dropdown with a label.
- **cn**: A utility function imported from `@/utils/cn`, used for conditional class name application.
- **Virtuoso**: A component from `react-virtuoso`, used for list virtualization to improve performance with large option sets.

## Symbols

### `MultiselectPlugin`
#### Description
The `MultiselectPlugin` class implements the `IPlugin` interface, providing a multi-select dropdown component. It validates input data using a schema and renders the `Multiselect` component with the provided properties.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | `IPluginProps&lt;string[], Data&gt;` | Properties including initial values, options, and configuration for the multi-select component. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | `JSX.Element` | The rendered multi-select component. |

### `Multiselect`
#### Description
A React functional component that renders a multi-select dropdown with search and selection capabilities. It uses a custom filter function to determine which options to display based on user input.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | `MultiselectProps` | Properties including options, label, selected values, and a setter function for updating selections. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | `JSX.Element` | The rendered multi-select dropdown component. |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `useId` to generate a unique ID for accessibility.
- Maintains a `searchQuery` state to track the user's input for filtering options.
- Uses `useMemo` to compute `filteredOptions` based on the `searchQuery`.
- Implements a `setValue` function to update selected values, respecting the `maxSelections` constraint.
- Renders a `Combobox` with either a simple list or a virtualized list using `Virtuoso` if the number of options exceeds 200.

### `multiselectFilterFn`
#### Description
A custom filter function that checks if all words in the search query are present in an option, allowing for a more lenient match than an exact match.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| option | `string` | The option to be checked against the search query. |
| value | `string` | The search query input by the user. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | `number` | Returns 1 if the option matches the query, otherwise 0. |

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `react-virtuoso` | Used for list virtualization to improve performance with large datasets. |
| `zod` | Used for schema validation of the plugin's input data. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors beyond basic constraints, such as limiting the number of selections based on `maxSelections`.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The `MultiselectPlugin` class implements the `IPlugin` interface, which is part of a larger plugin system. It provides a `render` method that returns a JSX element for integration into a React application.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
