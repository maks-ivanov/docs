## High-level description

The target file, `marks.ts`, is part of a Vega plugin implementation in a frontend application. It provides utility functions for handling Vega mark types, including determining the type of a mark, making marks clickable, and retrieving the opacity of a mark. These functions are used to enhance the interactivity and visual representation of Vega charts.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are organized as methods within the `Marks` object. These methods interact with each other and with other parts of the codebase, particularly through the `AnyMark` and `Mark` types imported from the `types` module. The `Marks` object is used in other files, such as `encodings.ts` and `make-selectable.ts`, to manipulate and enhance Vega chart specifications.

## Symbols

### `Marks`
#### Description
The `Marks` object provides utility functions for handling Vega mark types. It includes methods to determine the type of a mark, make marks clickable, and retrieve the opacity of a mark.

#### Methods

- **`getMarkType`**
  - **Description**: Determines the type of a given mark. If the mark is a string, it returns the string; otherwise, it returns the `type` property of the mark object. It throws an error for unsupported mark types like "boxplot", "errorband", and "errorbar".
  - **Inputs**
    | Name | Type | Description |
    |:-----|:-----|:------------|
    | mark | `AnyMark` | The mark whose type is to be determined. |
  - **Outputs**
    | Name | Type | Description |
    |:-----|:-----|:------------|
    | type | `Mark` | The type of the mark. |

- **`makeClickable`**
  - **Description**: Enhances a mark by making it clickable. It adds a cursor style of "pointer" and enables tooltips if the mark type is recognized.
  - **Inputs**
    | Name | Type | Description |
    |:-----|:-----|:------------|
    | mark | `AnyMark` | The mark to be made clickable. |
  - **Outputs**
    | Name | Type | Description |
    |:-----|:-----|:------------|
    | mark | `AnyMark` | The modified mark with clickable properties. |

- **`getOpacity`**
  - **Description**: Retrieves the opacity of a mark if it is defined and is a number. Returns `null` if the opacity is not defined or the mark is a string.
  - **Inputs**
    | Name | Type | Description |
    |:-----|:-----|:------------|
    | mark | `AnyMark` | The mark from which to retrieve opacity. |
  - **Outputs**
    | Name | Type | Description |
    |:-----|:-----|:------------|
    | opacity | `number \| null` | The opacity of the mark or `null` if not applicable. |

## References

- **`AnyMark` and `Mark`**: These types are imported from the `types` module and are used to define the input and output types for the methods in the `Marks` object.
- **`Marks` in other files**: The `Marks` object is used in related files like `encodings.ts` and `make-selectable.ts` to manipulate Vega chart specifications, such as making charts interactive and determining mark types.

## Dependencies

The code relies on the `types` module for type definitions, specifically `AnyMark` and `Mark`.

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `./types` | Provides type definitions for marks used in the utility functions. |

## Error Handling

The `getMarkType` method throws an error if the mark type is "boxplot", "errorband", or "errorbar", indicating that these types are not supported.

## Logging

There are no logging mechanisms implemented in this code.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
