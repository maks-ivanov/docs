## High-level description

The target file `types.ts` in the `frontend/src/plugins/impl/vega` directory defines TypeScript types and exports related to Vega-Lite specifications. These types are used to facilitate the integration and manipulation of Vega-Lite visualizations within a TypeScript-based frontend application. The file primarily imports and re-exports types from the `vega-lite` library, providing a structured way to define and work with Vega-Lite specifications in the application.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are TypeScript type definitions and exports. These types are interconnected as they are used to define the structure and constraints of Vega-Lite specifications and their components, such as encodings, marks, and selections.

## References

The code heavily references the `vega-lite` library, importing various types related to Vega-Lite specifications, encodings, marks, and selections. These references are crucial for understanding how the types in this file are structured and used.

## Symbols

### `VegaLiteUnitSpec`
#### Description
Defines a type alias for a top-level unit specification in Vega-Lite, parameterized by a `Field`. This type is used to represent a complete Vega-Lite specification for a single visualization unit.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Field | type | Represents a field in a data source used in the specification. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output1 | TopLevelUnitSpec&lt;Field&gt; | A complete unit specification for a Vega-Lite visualization. |

### `GenericVegaSpec`
#### Description
Defines a type alias for a generic unit specification in Vega-Lite, allowing for any type of data, encoding, and mark. This type is used for more flexible and less constrained specifications.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| any | type | Allows any type for data, encoding, and mark. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output1 | GenericUnitSpec&lt;any, any, any&gt; | A generic unit specification for a Vega-Lite visualization. |

### `EncodingType`
#### Description
Defines a type alias for the keys of the `Encoding` type, representing the different encoding channels available in Vega-Lite (e.g., x, y, color).

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Field | type | Represents a field in a data source used in the encoding. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output1 | keyof Encoding&lt;Field&gt; | A key representing an encoding channel in Vega-Lite. |

### `Encodings`
#### Description
Defines a type alias for the `Encoding` type parameterized by a `Field`, representing the encoding channels and their configurations in a Vega-Lite specification.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Field | type | Represents a field in a data source used in the encoding. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output1 | Encoding&lt;Field&gt; | The encoding channels and their configurations for a Vega-Lite specification. |

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `vega-lite` | Provides types and structures for defining Vega-Lite specifications, encodings, marks, and selections. |

## Error Handling

The file does not implement specific error handling mechanisms as it primarily defines types and exports.

## Logging

The file does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The file does not explicitly define an API or public interface beyond the TypeScript types and exports.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
