## High-level description

The target file `log-viewer.stories.tsx` is a Storybook configuration file for the `LogViewer` component. It defines and exports stories that demonstrate how the `LogViewer` component can be used within a dialog, showcasing different states such as a populated log view and an empty log view. This setup is useful for UI testing and documentation purposes, allowing developers to visualize and interact with the component in isolation.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are interconnected as follows:
- `LogViewer`: The primary component being demonstrated, which displays logs.
- `Dialog` and `TooltipProvider`: UI components used to wrap the `LogViewer` to provide additional UI features like modals and tooltips.
- `Meta` and `StoryObj`: Types from Storybook used to define metadata and story objects for the `LogViewer` component.

## Symbols

### `meta`
#### Description
The `meta` object defines metadata for the `LogViewer` component story, including the title and the component itself. It is used by Storybook to organize and display the story.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| title | string | The title of the story in Storybook. |
| component | React Component | The component being documented, `LogViewer`. |
| args | object | Default arguments for the component. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| meta | Meta&lt;typeof LogViewer&gt; | Metadata object for Storybook. |

### `Primary`
#### Description
The `Primary` story demonstrates the `LogViewer` component with a set of predefined logs. It shows how the component behaves when it has data to display.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| render | function | A function that returns a JSX element rendering the `LogViewer` with logs. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Primary | StoryObj&lt;typeof LogViewer&gt; | A Storybook story object for the `LogViewer`. |

#### Internal Logic
- The `render` function creates a `Dialog` containing a `TooltipProvider` and the `LogViewer`.
- The `LogViewer` is provided with an array of log objects, each containing a timestamp, log level, cell ID, and message.
- A large number of logs are generated using `Array.from` to simulate a realistic log environment.

### `Empty`
#### Description
The `Empty` story demonstrates the `LogViewer` component with no logs, showcasing how the component handles an empty state.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| render | function | A function that returns a JSX element rendering the `LogViewer` without logs. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Empty | StoryObj&lt;typeof LogViewer&gt; | A Storybook story object for the `LogViewer`. |

#### Internal Logic
- The `render` function creates a `Dialog` containing a `TooltipProvider` and the `LogViewer`.
- The `LogViewer` is provided with an empty array, demonstrating its behavior when no logs are available.

## Error Handling

The code does not implement specific error handling mechanisms beyond basic TypeScript type checking and React component rendering.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms. The `LogViewer` component itself is responsible for displaying logs, but this is not related to logging within the code.

## API/Interface Reference

The code does not expose an API or public interface beyond the Storybook stories for the `LogViewer` component.
