## High-level description

The target file `data-explorer.stories.tsx` is a Storybook story for the `DataExplorerComponent`, which is part of a data visualization tool. This story sets up a simple interactive example of the `DataExplorerComponent`, allowing users to explore data from a CSV file hosted on GitHub. It uses React's `useState` hook to manage the state of the chart specification (`ChartSpec`).

## Code Structure

- The file imports the `DataExplorerComponent` from a specific path and uses it within a Storybook story.
- It defines a `Meta` object for Storybook configuration and a `StoryObj` for rendering the `DataExplorerComponent`.
- The `DataExplorerComponent` is rendered with a data URL and a state management function for the chart specification.

## References

- `DataExplorerComponent`: This component is imported from `ConnectedDataExplorerComponent.tsx` and is the main component being demonstrated in the story.
- `ChartSpec`: This type is imported from `state/types.ts` and is used to define the state of the chart within the story.

## Symbols

### `meta`

### `DataExplorer`
#### Description
`DataExplorer` is a Storybook story object that renders the `DataExplorerComponent` with a specific data source and manages its state using React's `useState` hook.

#### Inputs

## Error Handling

The code does not implement specific error handling mechanisms beyond basic exception raising. The `DataExplorerComponent` itself may handle errors internally, as seen in the related file `ConnectedDataExplorerComponent.tsx`.

## Logging

The story includes a simple logging mechanism using `console.log` to output the updated chart specification whenever it changes.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
