## High-level description
The target file `editor-inputs.stories.tsx` is a Storybook configuration file that defines and exports stories for the `Button` and `Input` components used in an editor interface. It provides a visual testing environment where developers can interact with these components, customize their properties, and observe their behavior in isolation.

## Code Structure
The main symbols in the code are the `ButtonTemplate` and `InputTemplate` functions, which are used to create Storybook stories for the `Button` and `Input` components, respectively. These templates are then bound to `ButtonStory` and `InputStory` exports, which define the specific configurations and properties for each story.

## Symbols

### `ButtonTemplate`
#### Description
`ButtonTemplate` is a Storybook template function for rendering the `Button` component with customizable properties. It wraps the `Button` component in a `div` with margin styling and includes a `PlayIcon` as a child element.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| args | Object | Properties to customize the `Button` component, such as color, size, and shape. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | JSX | A JSX element representing the `Button` component with the specified properties. |

#### Internal Logic
- The function uses the spread operator to apply the `args` properties to the `Button` component.
- It includes a `PlayIcon` component as a child of the `Button`.

### `ButtonStory`
#### Description
`ButtonStory` is a Storybook story for the `Button` component, allowing users to interact with and customize the button's appearance and behavior.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | N/A |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | N/A |

#### Internal Logic
- The story is created by binding `ButtonTemplate`.
- It defines `argTypes` to specify the possible values for the `Button` component's properties, such as `color`, `size`, and `shape`.
- An `onClick` action is defined to log clicks in the Storybook action panel.

### `InputTemplate`
#### Description
`InputTemplate` is a Storybook template function for rendering the `Input` component with customizable properties. It wraps the `Input` component in a `div` with margin styling.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| args | Object | Properties to customize the `Input` component. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | JSX | A JSX element representing the `Input` component with the specified properties. |

#### Internal Logic
- The function uses the spread operator to apply the `args` properties to the `Input` component.
- It assigns a static `id` and `className` to the `Input` component.

### `InputStory`
#### Description
`InputStory` is a Storybook story for the `Input` component, allowing users to interact with and customize the input field's properties.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | N/A |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | N/A |

#### Internal Logic
- The story is created by binding `InputTemplate`.
- It initializes with empty `args`, allowing for default behavior.

## References
- `Button` and `Input` components are imported from `../components/editor/inputs/Inputs`.
- `PlayIcon` is imported from `lucide-react`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@storybook/react` | Provides the `StoryFn` and `Meta` types for defining Storybook stories. |
| `lucide-react` | Provides the `PlayIcon` component used within the `Button` story. |

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling mechanisms beyond what is provided by Storybook and React.

## Logging
The `ButtonStory` includes an `onClick` action that logs button clicks in the Storybook action panel, which is useful for tracking interactions during testing.

## API/Interface Reference
The code does not define an API or public interface beyond the Storybook stories for the `Button` and `Input` components.
