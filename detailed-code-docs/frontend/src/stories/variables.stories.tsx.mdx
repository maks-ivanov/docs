## High-level description

The target file `variables.stories.tsx` is a Storybook story for the `VariableTable` component. It defines a set of mock variables and a story named `Primary` that renders the `VariableTable` with these variables. This setup is used for visual testing and documentation of the `VariableTable` component in a Storybook environment.

## Code Structure

- **Meta Configuration**: The `meta` object defines the metadata for the Storybook story, including the title and the component to be rendered.
- **Variables Definition**: A set of mock variables is defined to simulate different scenarios for the `VariableTable`.
- **Story Definition**: The `Primary` story renders the `VariableTable` component with the mock variables and a specified order of cell IDs.

## References

- **`VariableTable`**: This component is imported from `@/components/variables/variables-table` and is the main component being tested in the story.
- **`CellId`**: This type is imported from `@/core/cells/ids` and is used to type the `cellIds` array passed to the `VariableTable`.

#### Internal Logic
- The `Primary` story uses a `render` function to return a JSX element.
