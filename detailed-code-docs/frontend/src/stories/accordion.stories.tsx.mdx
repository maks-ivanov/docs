## High-level description

The target file `accordion.stories.tsx` is a Storybook configuration file that defines several stories for an `Accordion` component. These stories demonstrate different configurations and use cases of the `Accordion` component, showcasing its functionality and design variations. The file imports the `Accordion` and its related components from a UI library and uses them to create interactive examples.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `Accordion`, `AccordionItem`, `AccordionTrigger`, and `AccordionContent` components, which are imported from a UI library. These components are used to construct different stories that demonstrate the accordion's behavior in various scenarios. Each story is an object with a `render` function that returns a JSX structure representing the accordion in a specific configuration.

## Symbols

### `Inline`
#### Description
The `Inline` story demonstrates a single accordion item that is collapsible and styled to fit its content width.

#### Inputs
None directly, but it uses the `Accordion` and related components.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX | React Element | A rendered accordion with a single item. |

#### Internal Logic
The `Inline` story uses the `Accordion` component with the `type` set to "single" and `collapsible` set to `true`. It contains one `AccordionItem` with a `Trigger` and `Content`.

### `SingleItem`
#### Description
The `SingleItem` story showcases a single accordion item that spans the full width of its container.

#### Inputs
None directly, but it uses the `Accordion` and related components.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX | React Element | A rendered accordion with a single item. |

#### Internal Logic
Similar to `Inline`, but the accordion is styled to take the full width of its container.

### `MultipleItemsSingle`
#### Description
The `MultipleItemsSingle` story demonstrates an accordion with multiple items, where only one item can be expanded at a time.

#### Inputs
None directly, but it uses the `Accordion` and related components.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX | React Element | A rendered accordion with multiple items. |

#### Internal Logic
The `Accordion` is set to "single" type, allowing only one item to be open at a time. It includes three `AccordionItem` components, each with a `Trigger` and `Content`.

### `MultipleItemsMultiple`
#### Description
The `MultipleItemsMultiple` story illustrates an accordion with multiple items, where multiple items can be expanded simultaneously.

#### Inputs
None directly, but it uses the `Accordion` and related components.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX | React Element | A rendered accordion with multiple items. |

#### Internal Logic
The `Accordion` is set to "multiple" type, allowing multiple items to be open at once. It includes three `AccordionItem` components, each with a `Trigger` and `Content`.

## References

The target file references components from the `accordion.tsx` file, which provides the implementation of the `Accordion`, `AccordionItem`, `AccordionTrigger`, and `AccordionContent` components. These components are built using the `@radix-ui/react-accordion` library and styled with additional classes.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@radix-ui/react-accordion` | Provides the base functionality for the accordion components. |
| `lucide-react` | Supplies the `ChevronDown` icon used in the `AccordionTrigger`. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors, as it primarily focuses on rendering UI components for demonstration purposes.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in this code, as it is intended for UI demonstration in a Storybook environment.

## API/Interface Reference

The code does not expose an API but provides a visual interface for interacting with the `Accordion` component through Storybook stories. Each story represents a different configuration of the accordion component, allowing users to see how it behaves in various scenarios.
