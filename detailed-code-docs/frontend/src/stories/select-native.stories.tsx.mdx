## High-level description

The target file `select-native.stories.tsx` is a Storybook configuration file for the `NativeSelect` component. It defines different stories to showcase the `NativeSelect` component with various options, allowing developers to visualize and test the component's behavior with different sets of options.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `NativeSelect` component and the stories (`ShortOptions`, `OneLongOption`, `OneReallyLongOption`) that demonstrate different configurations of this component. The `NativeSelect` component is imported from the `native-select.tsx` file, and each story provides a different set of options to the component to illustrate its usage.

## Symbols

### `NativeSelect`
#### Description
The `NativeSelect` component is a styled HTML `&lt;select&gt;` element that allows users to choose from a list of options. It is designed to be used within a React application and is styled using the `class-variance-authority` library to provide consistent styling across different variants.

#### Inputs
| Name      | Type                                           | Description                          |
|:----------|:-----------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------|
| className | string                                         | Additional CSS classes for styling.  |
| children  | React.ReactNode                                | The options to be displayed.         |
| props     | React.InputHTMLAttributes&lt;HTMLSelectElement&gt;   | Additional HTML attributes.          |
| ref       | React.Ref&lt;HTMLSelectElement&gt;                   | Reference to the select element.     |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | N/A         |

#### Internal Logic
The `NativeSelect` component uses the `React.forwardRef` function to pass a ref to the underlying `&lt;select&gt;` element. It applies styles using the `cn` utility function and the `selectStyles` from the `class-variance-authority` library. The `onClick` event handler is set to stop event propagation using the `Events.stopPropagation()` utility.

### `ShortOptions`
#### Description
This story renders the `NativeSelect` component with a short list of options, demonstrating how the component behaves with a small number of choices.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | N/A         |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | N/A         |

### `OneLongOption`
#### Description
This story renders the `NativeSelect` component with one option that is longer than the others, showcasing how the component handles options of varying lengths.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | N/A         |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | N/A         |

### `OneReallyLongOption`
#### Description
This story renders the `NativeSelect` component with one very long option, testing the component's ability to display and manage very lengthy text within an option.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | N/A         |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | N/A         |
