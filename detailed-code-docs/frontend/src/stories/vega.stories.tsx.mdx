## High-level description

The target file `vega.stories.tsx` is a Storybook configuration file that defines a series of stories for visualizing different types of charts using the Vega visualization library. It imports various chart specifications and uses a `VegaComponent` to render these charts with different selection options, allowing users to interact with the charts in a Storybook environment.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are interconnected as follows:
- `VegaComponent`: A React component used to render Vega charts.
- `VegaLiteSpec`: A type representing the specification for a Vega-Lite chart.
- Various chart specifications (e.g., `AREA_CHART`, `BAR_CHART`) are imported from a fixtures file and used to create different stories.
- `chartWithData`: A function that takes a chart specification and renders it using `VegaComponent` with different selection options.

## Symbols

### `meta`
#### Description
The `meta` object is a configuration for Storybook that sets the title of the story group to "Vega" and initializes any default arguments.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

### `selectionOptions`
#### Description
An array of possible selection modes for the charts, including `true`, `false`, `"interval"`, and `"point"`. These options are used to configure the `chartSelection` property of the `VegaComponent`.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

### `chartWithData`
#### Description
A function that renders a `VegaComponent` for a given chart specification with different selection options. It creates a series of charts with varying selection modes to demonstrate the interactive capabilities of the charts.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| spec | `VegaLiteSpec` | The specification for the Vega-Lite chart to be rendered. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | JSX.Element | A JSX element containing the rendered chart components. |

#### Internal Logic
- The function maps over `selectionOptions` to create a `VegaComponent` for each selection mode.
- Each `VegaComponent` is rendered within a `div` with a flex layout to arrange the charts vertically with a gap.

### Chart Export Functions
#### Description
Each function (e.g., `AreaChart`, `BarChart`) exports a specific chart story by calling `chartWithData` with the corresponding chart specification.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | JSX.Element | A JSX element containing the rendered chart component for the specific chart type. |

## References

- `VegaComponent`: Imported from `@/plugins/impl/vega/vega-component`, it is the main component used to render the charts.
- `VegaLiteSpec`: A type imported from `@/plugins/impl/vega/types`, representing the chart specification format.
- Chart specifications (e.g., `AREA_CHART`, `BAR_CHART`): Imported from `./__fixtures__/vega`, these are predefined chart configurations used in the stories.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@storybook/react` | Provides the `Meta` type for configuring Storybook stories. |

## Error Handling

The code does not implement specific error handling mechanisms within the target file. Error handling is likely managed within the `VegaComponent`, as seen in the related code snippets.

## Logging

The code does not implement logging within the target file. Any logging would be handled by the `VegaComponent` or other imported utilities.

## API/Interface Reference

The code does not expose an API or public interface directly. It is a configuration file for Storybook, which is a tool for developing and testing UI components.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
