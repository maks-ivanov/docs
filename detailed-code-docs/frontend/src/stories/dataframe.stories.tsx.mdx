## High-level description

The target file `dataframe.stories.tsx` is a Storybook story for the `DataFrameComponent`, which is part of a data visualization and manipulation plugin. This story sets up a mock environment to demonstrate how the `DataFrameComponent` can be used, including its interactions with data columns, transformations, and sorting functionalities.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are interconnected as follows:
- `DataFrameComponent`: The primary component being demonstrated, which is responsible for rendering a data frame with various functionalities like sorting and transformations.
- `useState`: A React hook used to manage the state of transformations applied to the data frame.
- `Functions.THROW`: A utility function used to handle unimplemented functionalities by throwing an error.
- `meta` and `DataFrame`: Storybook constructs used to define and render the story for the `DataFrameComponent`.

## Symbols

### `meta`
#### Description
The `meta` object defines metadata for the Storybook story, including the title of the story.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

### `DataFrame`
#### Description
The `DataFrame` object is a Storybook story that renders the `DataFrameComponent` with mock data and configurations to demonstrate its functionality.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `useState` to manage the state of transformations (`value`).
- Renders the `DataFrameComponent` with several props:
  - `get_column_values`: An asynchronous function returning mock column values.
  - `columns`: A map defining column IDs and their data types.
  - `dataframeName`: A string representing the name of the data frame.
  - `pageSize`: An integer defining the number of rows per page.
  - `value` and `setValue`: State and state updater for transformations.
  - `get_dataframe`: A function that currently throws an error, indicating it's not implemented.
  - `sort_values`: Uses `Functions.THROW` to handle sorting, indicating it's not implemented.

## References

- `DataFrameComponent`: The main component being demonstrated, imported from `DataFramePlugin`.
- `Transformations`: A type imported from `schema` that represents the transformations applied to the data frame.
- `ColumnId`: A type imported from `types` that represents column identifiers.
- `Functions`: A utility module providing various helper functions, including `THROW`.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@storybook/react` | Provides types and utilities for creating Storybook stories. |
| `react` | Provides the `useState` hook for managing component state. |

## Error Handling

- The `get_dataframe` function is set to throw an error with the message "not implemented", indicating that this functionality is not yet available in the story.

## Logging

- The `setValue` function logs the new transformation value to the console whenever it is updated.

## Side Effects

- The `setValue` function updates the state of transformations and logs the new value to the console.

## Performance Considerations

- The story uses mock data and functions, so performance considerations are minimal in this context. However, in a real-world scenario, the performance of data fetching and transformation operations would need to be considered.
