## High-level description

The target file `select.stories.tsx` is a Storybook configuration file for the `Select` component in a React application. It defines two stories, `Primary` and `Clearable`, which demonstrate the usage of the `Select` component with different configurations. The `Primary` story showcases a basic select dropdown with grouped items, while the `Clearable` story adds functionality to clear the selected value.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `Select` component and its related subcomponents (`SelectTrigger`, `SelectContent`, `SelectGroup`, `SelectItem`, `SelectLabel`, `SelectSeparator`, `SelectValue`). These components are imported from a UI library and are used to construct the select dropdowns in the stories. The `meta` object defines the Storybook metadata for the `Select` component, and the `Primary` and `Clearable` objects define the individual stories.

## Symbols

### `meta`
#### Description
The `meta` object provides metadata for the Storybook configuration, including the title and the component being documented.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| title | string | The title of the story in Storybook. |
| component | React Component | The component being documented. |
| args | object | Default arguments for the component. |

#### Outputs
None

### `Primary`
#### Description
The `Primary` story demonstrates a basic usage of the `Select` component with grouped items for fruits, vegetables, and meat.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| args | object | Arguments passed to the story. |
| ctx | object | Contextual information for the story. |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Renders a `Select` component with a `SelectTrigger` and `SelectContent`.
- The `SelectContent` contains multiple `SelectGroup` elements, each with a `SelectLabel` and several `SelectItem` elements.
- A `SelectSeparator` is used to visually separate the groups.

### `Clearable`
#### Description
The `Clearable` story extends the `Primary` story by adding functionality to clear the selected value.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| args | object | Arguments passed to the story. |
| ctx | object | Contextual information for the story. |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the `useState` hook to manage the selected value.
- Renders a `Select` component with a `SelectTrigger` that includes an `onClear` function to reset the value.
- Displays the current selected value below the `Select` component.

## References

The `Select` component and its subcomponents are imported from the `@/components/ui/select` module, which is defined in the related code snippet `select.tsx`. This module provides the implementation of the select dropdown and its various parts.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@storybook/react` | Provides the `Meta` and `StoryObj` types for Storybook configuration. |
| `react` | Provides the `useState` hook for managing component state. |
