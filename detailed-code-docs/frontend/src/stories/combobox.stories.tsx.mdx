## High-level description

The target file `combobox.stories.tsx` is a Storybook file that defines various stories for a `Combobox` component. These stories demonstrate different configurations and use cases of the `Combobox`, such as basic usage, multiple selection, and custom filtering. The file is used to visually test and showcase the `Combobox` component in a development environment.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `Combobox` and `ComboboxItem` components, which are imported from the `../components/ui/combobox` module. The file defines several stories (`Basic`, `Multiple`, `MultipleWithChips`, `Large`, and `WithCustomFilterFn`) that each render the `Combobox` with different props and configurations. The `frameworks` array and `OPTIONS` constant provide data for the combobox items in the stories.

## Symbols

### `Framework`

| label | string | The display label of the framework. |

#### Outputs
This interface does not produce outputs but is used to type-check objects.

### `frameworks`
#### Description
An array of framework objects that conform to the `Framework` interface. This array is used as the data source for the `Combobox` items in several stories.

### `Basic`
#### Description
A Storybook story that renders a basic `Combobox` allowing the selection of a single framework from the `frameworks` array.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |

### `Multiple`
#### Description
A Storybook story that renders a `Combobox` allowing multiple selections from the `frameworks` array.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|

### `MultipleWithChips`
#### Description
A Storybook story that renders a `Combobox` allowing multiple selections with visual chips for each selected item.

#### Outputs

## References

- `Combobox` and `ComboboxItem` components are imported from `../components/ui/combobox`, which define the main functionality and rendering logic for the combobox and its items.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `../components/ui/combobox` | Provides the `Combobox` and `ComboboxItem` components used in the stories. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors, as it is primarily focused on rendering UI components for demonstration purposes.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in this code, as it is intended for use in a Storybook environment where visual output is the primary concern.

## API/Interface Reference

The file does not expose an API but rather defines stories for visual testing in Storybook. Each story represents a different configuration of the `Combobox` component.
