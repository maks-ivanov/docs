## High-level description

The target file `progress.stories.tsx` is a Storybook configuration file for the `Progress` component. It defines different visual states of the `Progress` component, such as empty, half, and full, to facilitate UI testing and documentation.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `meta` object, the `Template` function, and the exported story instances (`Empty`, `Half`, `Full`). The `meta` object configures the Storybook story for the `Progress` component, while the `Template` function serves as a base for creating different story instances with varying arguments.

## Symbols

### `meta`
#### Description
The `meta` object is a configuration object for Storybook that defines metadata for the `Progress` component stories. It specifies the title under which the stories will appear in the Storybook UI and associates the `Progress` component with these stories.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| title | string | The title of the story in the Storybook UI. |
| component | React Component | The component being documented and tested. |
| args | object | Default arguments for the component stories. |

#### Outputs
There are no direct outputs from the `meta` object, as it serves as a configuration.

### `Template`
#### Description
The `Template` function is a Storybook pattern that provides a base for creating different story instances. It renders the `Progress` component within a styled `div` and applies any arguments passed to it.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| args | object | Arguments to customize the `Progress` component's rendering. |

#### Outputs
The function returns a JSX element that represents the `Progress` component wrapped in a `div`.

#### Internal Logic
The `Template` function uses the spread operator to pass all received `args` to the `Progress` component, allowing for dynamic customization of the component's properties.

### `Empty`, `Half`, `Full`
#### Description
These are specific instances of the `Template` function, each representing a different state of the `Progress` component. They are used to demonstrate how the component looks with different `value` props.

#### Inputs
Each story instance has a specific `args` object:
- `Empty.args` sets `value` to 0.
- `Half.args` sets `value` to 50.
- `Full.args` sets `value` to 100.

#### Outputs
Each story instance outputs a JSX element that visually represents the `Progress` component in the specified state.
