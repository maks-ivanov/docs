## High-level description

The target file `checkbox.stories.tsx` is a Storybook configuration file for the `Checkbox` component. It defines two stories, "With Text" and "Disabled", to demonstrate the appearance and behavior of the `Checkbox` component in different states. Storybook is a tool for developing UI components in isolation, which helps in visual testing and documentation.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `Checkbox` component and the two story objects, `WithText` and `Disabled`. The `Checkbox` component is imported from the `ui/checkbox` module, and it is used within the render functions of the story objects to showcase different use cases of the component.

## References

- `Checkbox`: This component is imported from the `ui/checkbox` module and is the primary UI element being demonstrated in the stories.

## Symbols

### `WithText`
#### Description
The `WithText` story demonstrates a `Checkbox` component with accompanying text that describes the terms and conditions. It shows how the checkbox can be used alongside text labels and additional information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | N/A  | This story does not take any inputs. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| render | JSX.Element | A JSX element representing the checkbox with text. |

#### Internal Logic
- Renders a `Checkbox` component with an `id` of "terms1".
- Includes a `label` element associated with the checkbox using the `htmlFor` attribute.
- Displays additional text below the label to provide more context about the terms and conditions.

### `Disabled`
#### Description
The `Disabled` story demonstrates a `Checkbox` component that is disabled, showing how the component appears and behaves when it cannot be interacted with.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | N/A  | This story does not take any inputs. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| render | JSX.Element | A JSX element representing the disabled checkbox. |

#### Internal Logic
- Renders a `Checkbox` component with an `id` of "terms2" and the `disabled` attribute set to `true`.
- Includes a `label` element associated with the checkbox using the `htmlFor` attribute.
- The label's style changes when the checkbox is disabled, indicating that it is not interactive.
