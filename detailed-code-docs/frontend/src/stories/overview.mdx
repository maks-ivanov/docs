## High-level description

The `frontend/src/stories` directory is a collection of Storybook configuration files and Markdown files that define various UI component stories for a frontend application. These stories are used to visually test and document the behavior and appearance of different UI components in isolation. The directory includes stories for a wide range of components, such as charts, buttons, dialogs, inputs, and more, each demonstrating different configurations and use cases.

## What does it do?

The directory serves as a comprehensive setup for Storybook, a tool that allows developers to build and test UI components in isolation. Each file in the directory corresponds to a specific component or set of components and defines stories that showcase different states and configurations of those components. For example, stories might demonstrate how a button looks in different states (default, disabled, with an icon), how a chart can be configured with different data sets, or how a dialog behaves when opened or closed.

By using Storybook, developers can interact with these components, customize their properties, and observe their behavior without needing to run the entire application. This setup is particularly useful for UI development, as it provides a visual reference for how components should look and behave, making it easier to spot inconsistencies or issues.

## Entry points

The directory contains numerous files, each focusing on a specific component or set of components. Here are some of the main files and their purposes:

- **`accordion.stories.tsx`**: Demonstrates the `Accordion` component with various configurations.
- **`button.stories.tsx`**: Showcases different states and variants of the `Button` component.
- **`dialog.stories.tsx`**: Illustrates the `Dialog` component in open and closed states.
- **`input.stories.tsx`**: Displays different configurations of the `Input` component.
- **`vega.stories.tsx`**: Visualizes different types of charts using the Vega visualization library.

Each file typically imports the component it is showcasing, defines a set of stories using Storybook's API, and exports these stories for use in the Storybook UI.

## Key Files

- **`__fixtures__/vega.ts`**: Contains Vega-Lite specifications for various chart types, used in the `vega.stories.tsx` file to render different charts.
- **`data-explorer.stories.tsx`**: Demonstrates the `DataExplorerComponent`, allowing users to explore data from a CSV file.
- **`form-wrapper.stories.tsx`**: Showcases the `FormWrapper` component with different states and configurations, such as loading and validation.
- **`progress-component.stories.tsx`**: Displays the `ProgressComponent` in various states, such as with rate and ETA information.

## Dependencies

The directory relies on several external libraries and frameworks to function:

- **`@storybook/react`**: Provides the core functionality for creating and managing Storybook stories.
- **`react`**: Used for building the UI components and managing state within the stories.
- **`@radix-ui/react-*`**: A set of UI components used for building complex UI elements like dialogs and tooltips.
- **`lucide-react`**: Provides icon components used in various stories.
- **`vega-lite`**: Used for defining and rendering data visualizations in the `vega.stories.tsx` file.

These dependencies are chosen for their ability to facilitate the development and testing of UI components, providing a robust set of tools for building interactive and visually appealing interfaces.
