## High-level description

The code in `colors.stories.tsx` is a Storybook configuration file that defines visual stories for different CSS classes related to colors, border radii, and shadows. It provides a visual representation of these styles by rendering them in a grid layout, allowing developers to preview and verify the appearance of these styles in a user interface.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around three main Storybook stories: `Colors`, `Round`, and `Shadows`. Each story is responsible for rendering a set of CSS classes in a grid format. The `Colors` story displays various background color classes, the `Round` story shows different border radius classes, and the `Shadows` story presents different shadow classes.

## Symbols

### `COLORS`
#### Description
An array of strings representing different CSS classes for background colors and their foreground counterparts.

### `meta`
#### Description
A metadata object for Storybook that defines the title of the stories as "Variables" and initializes an empty `args` object.

### `Colors`
#### Description
A Storybook story that renders a grid of div elements, each styled with a different background color class from the `COLORS` array.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX Element | React Element | A grid of div elements styled with background color classes |

#### Internal Logic
- Iterates over the `COLORS` array.
- For each color, creates a div with the corresponding background color class and a label displaying the class name.

### `ROUND`
#### Description
An array of strings representing different CSS classes for border radii.

### `Round`
#### Description
A Storybook story that renders a grid of div elements, each styled with a different border radius class from the `ROUND` array.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX Element | React Element | A grid of div elements styled with border radius classes |

#### Internal Logic
- Iterates over the `ROUND` array.
- For each border radius, creates a div with the corresponding class and a label displaying the class name.

### `SHADOWS` and `SOLID_SHADOWS`
#### Description
Arrays of strings representing different CSS classes for shadows and solid shadows, respectively.

### `Shadows`
#### Description
A Storybook story that renders a grid of div elements, each styled with a different shadow class from the `SHADOWS` and `SOLID_SHADOWS` arrays.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX Element | React Element | A grid of div elements styled with shadow classes |

#### Internal Logic
- Defines a helper function `renderShadows` to render a grid for a given array of shadow classes.
- Calls `renderShadows` for both `SHADOWS` and `SOLID_SHADOWS` arrays to display them in a flex column layout.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
