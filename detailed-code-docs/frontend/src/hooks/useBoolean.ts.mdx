## High-level description

The `useBoolean` hook in the target file `frontend/src/hooks/useBoolean.ts` provides a convenient way to manage boolean state in React components. It offers a simple API to toggle the state, set it to true, or set it to false, with optional event handling to stop event propagation.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in this file is the `useBoolean` function, which utilizes React's `useState` and `useCallback` hooks to manage and manipulate a boolean state. The function returns an array containing the current state and an object with methods to modify the state.

## Symbols

### `useBoolean`
#### Description
The `useBoolean` function is a custom React hook designed to manage a boolean state. It provides a simple interface to toggle the state, set it to true, or set it to false. This hook is particularly useful in scenarios where a component needs to frequently change between two states, such as showing or hiding UI elements.

#### Inputs
| Name         | Type    | Description                        |
|:-------------|:--------|:-----------------------------------|
| initialState | boolean | The initial state of the boolean.  |

#### Outputs
| Name   | Type   | Description                                                                 |
|:-------|:-------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| output | [boolean, object] | An array containing the current state and an object with methods to modify the state. |

#### Internal Logic
- **State Initialization**: The hook initializes a boolean state using `useState` with the provided `initialState`.
- **State Manipulation Methods**:
  - `setTrue`: A method to set the state to `true`. It optionally stops event propagation if an event is provided.
  - `setFalse`: A method to set the state to `false`. It optionally stops event propagation if an event is provided.
  - `toggle`: A method to toggle the state between `true` and `false`. It optionally stops event propagation if an event is provided.
- **Event Handling**: Each method can optionally take an event object and call `stopPropagation` on it to prevent the event from bubbling up the DOM.

## References

The `useBoolean` hook is referenced in several components across the codebase, such as in `range-slider.tsx` and `slider.tsx`, where it is used to manage the open state of tooltips. This demonstrates its utility in managing UI states that require toggling.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose                                      |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------------|
| `useState` | To manage the boolean state.                 |
| `useCallback` | To memoize the state manipulation functions. |

## Error Handling

The code does not implement specific error handling mechanisms beyond basic exception raising. The use of optional chaining (`?.`) ensures that the code does not throw errors if the event object or its methods are undefined.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## Performance Considerations

The use of `useCallback` ensures that the state manipulation functions are memoized, preventing unnecessary re-renders and improving performance when these functions are passed as props to child components.
