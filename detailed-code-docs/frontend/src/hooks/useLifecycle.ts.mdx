## High-level description

The `useLifecycle.ts` file defines a custom React hook, `useOnMount`, which is a wrapper around the `useEffect` hook. This custom hook is designed to execute a given effect only once when a component is mounted, simplifying the use of `useEffect` for this specific use case.

## Code Structure

The file contains a single function, `useOnMount`, which is a custom hook built on top of React's `useEffect`. It is designed to run an effect only once when a component is mounted.

## Symbols

### `useOnMount`
#### Description
The `useOnMount` function is a custom React hook that wraps the `useEffect` hook to ensure that the provided effect is executed only once, during the component's mount phase. This is useful for scenarios where an effect should only run once, such as setting up event listeners or initializing data.

#### Inputs
| Name   | Type          | Description                        |
|:-------|:--------------|:-----------------------------------|
| effect | `EffectCallback` | A function to be executed on component mount. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any output.

#### Internal Logic
- The `useOnMount` function calls `useEffect` with the provided `effect` and an empty dependency array `[]`.
- The empty dependency array ensures that the effect is only executed once, when the component is first mounted.

## References

The `useOnMount` hook is used in several components across the codebase, as seen in the related files. It is used to manage side effects that should only occur once during the lifecycle of a component, such as setting up event listeners or initializing data.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `react`    | Provides the `useEffect` hook which is used to implement the `useOnMount` functionality. |

## Error Handling

The `useOnMount` function does not implement any specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on the standard behavior of `useEffect` in React, which does not inherently handle errors within the effect function.

## Usage Example

In the related code snippets, `useOnMount` is used in components like `NameCellInput` and `AnyWidgetSlot` to set up event listeners or initialize components when they are first rendered. This ensures that the setup logic is only executed once, avoiding unnecessary re-runs of the effect.

## Side Effects

The `useOnMount` hook itself does not have side effects, but the effect function passed to it can have side effects, such as modifying the DOM or setting up event listeners.

## Performance Considerations

Using `useOnMount` can improve performance by ensuring that certain effects are only executed once, rather than on every render. This is particularly beneficial for expensive operations or when setting up resources that should only be initialized once.
