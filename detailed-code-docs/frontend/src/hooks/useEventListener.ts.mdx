## High-level description

The `useEventListener` hook in the target file `frontend/src/hooks/useEventListener.ts` is a custom React hook designed to manage event listeners for DOM elements in a React application. It abstracts the process of adding and removing event listeners, ensuring that the listeners are properly updated when dependencies change, and are cleaned up when the component unmounts.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in this file is the `useEventListener` function. It utilizes React's `useRef` and `useEffect` hooks to manage the lifecycle of event listeners. The `useRef` hook is used to store a reference to the listener function, while `useEffect` is used to handle the addition and removal of the event listener based on the component's lifecycle.

## Symbols

### `useEventListener`
#### Description
The `useEventListener` function is a custom React hook that attaches an event listener to a specified target (such as a DOM element, the document, or the window). It ensures that the event listener is updated whenever the dependencies change and is removed when the component is unmounted, preventing memory leaks.

#### Inputs
| Name     | Type                                      | Description                                                                 |
|:---------|:------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `target` | `Document \| HTMLElement \| Window \| null` | The target to which the event listener will be attached.                    |
| `type`   | `K & string`                              | The type of event to listen for (e.g., "click", "keydown").                 |
| `listener` | `(ev: EventMap&lt;T&gt;[K]) =&gt; unknown`       | The event handler function that will be called when the event is triggered. |
| `options` | `boolean \| AddEventListenerOptions`     | Optional parameters for the event listener, such as capture, once, and passive. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | N/A  | The function does not return any value. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Reference Storage**: The `useRef` hook is used to store the current listener function, allowing it to persist across re-renders without causing the effect to re-run unnecessarily.
2. **Effect for Listener Update**: A `useEffect` hook updates the `savedListener` reference whenever the `listener` function changes.
3. **Effect for Event Listener Management**: Another `useEffect` hook manages the addition and removal of the event listener:
   - It checks if the `target` is valid.
   - It defines an `eventListener` function that calls the current `savedListener`.
   - It adds the `eventListener` to the `target` using `addEventListener`.
   - It returns a cleanup function that removes the `eventListener` using `removeEventListener`.

## References

The `useEventListener` hook is referenced in several other files, indicating its utility across different components for handling events. For example, it is used in components like `UndoButton`, `CommandPalette`, `DynamicFavicon`, and others to manage keyboard and focus events.

## Dependencies

The hook relies on React's `useRef` and `useEffect` hooks to manage state and side effects.

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors, but it ensures that event listeners are only added if the `target` is valid, which prevents runtime errors related to invalid targets.

## Side Effects

The primary side effect of this hook is the addition and removal of event listeners on the specified target, which is managed through the `useEffect` cleanup mechanism.

## Performance Considerations

The use of `useRef` to store the listener function ensures that the event listener is not unnecessarily re-attached on every render, which optimizes performance by minimizing DOM operations.
