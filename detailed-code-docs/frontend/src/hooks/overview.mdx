## High-level description

The `frontend/src/hooks` directory contains a collection of custom React hooks designed to enhance the functionality and performance of React components. These hooks provide utilities for debugging, managing asynchronous data, handling audio recording, managing boolean states, tracking render counts, debouncing values and callbacks, memoizing values with deep comparison, calculating elapsed time, managing event listeners, handling keyboard shortcuts, managing intervals, detecting drag actions, managing component lifecycle events, interacting with local storage, and managing recent commands. Each hook is tailored to address specific needs within a React application, promoting code reuse and simplifying complex operations.

## What does it do?

The hooks in this directory serve various purposes, each contributing to the overall functionality of a React application:

- **Debugging Hooks**: `useDebugMounting` and `usePropsDidChange` help developers track component lifecycle events and prop changes during development, logging relevant information to the console.

- **Data Management Hooks**: `useAsyncData` manages asynchronous data fetching, handling loading and error states, while `combineAsyncData` combines multiple asynchronous responses.

- **Audio Recording Hook**: `useAudioRecorder` provides a mechanism for recording audio, managing permissions, and handling the recording lifecycle.

- **State Management Hooks**: `useBoolean` simplifies boolean state management, offering methods to toggle, set true, or set false. `useLocalStorage` and `useRecentCommands` manage state with local storage persistence.

- **Performance Optimization Hooks**: `useDebounce`, `useDebounceControlledState`, and `useDebouncedCallback` optimize performance by limiting the rate of updates or executions. `useDeepCompareMemoize` prevents unnecessary re-renders by memoizing values with deep comparison.

- **Time Management Hooks**: `useElapsedTime` calculates the time elapsed since component mount, while `useTimer` provides a simple timer functionality.

- **Event Handling Hooks**: `useEventListener` and `useHotkey` manage event listeners and keyboard shortcuts, ensuring efficient event handling. `useInterval` executes callbacks at specified intervals, with visibility-based pausing.

- **Drag Detection Hook**: `useIsDragging` detects drag actions, ensuring only intentional drags are recognized.

- **Lifecycle Management Hook**: `useOnMount` executes effects only once during component mount, simplifying lifecycle management.

These hooks collectively enhance the development experience by abstracting common patterns and providing reusable solutions for complex tasks.
