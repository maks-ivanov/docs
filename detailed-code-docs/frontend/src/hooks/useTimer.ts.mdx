## High-level description

The `useTimer` hook in the target file is a custom React hook that provides a simple timer functionality. It allows components to start, stop, and clear a timer that increments every 100 milliseconds, returning the elapsed time in seconds formatted to one decimal place.

## Code Structure

The `useTimer` hook is the main symbol in the code. It utilizes React's `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef` hooks to manage the timer's state and lifecycle. The hook also uses the `useEvent` hook from the `react-use-event-hook` library to create stable event handlers for starting, stopping, and clearing the timer.

## Symbols

### `useTimer`
#### Description
The `useTimer` hook provides a timer that increments every 100 milliseconds. It offers methods to start, stop, and clear the timer, and returns the elapsed time formatted to one decimal place.

#### Inputs
This hook does not take any direct inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name   | Type   | Description                                      |
|:-------|:-------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| time   | string | The elapsed time in seconds, formatted to one decimal place. |
| start  | function | Function to start the timer.                   |
| stop   | function | Function to stop the timer.                    |
| clear  | function | Function to reset the timer to zero.           |

#### Internal Logic
- **State Management**: Uses `useState` to keep track of the elapsed time.
- **Interval Management**: Uses `useRef` to store the interval ID, allowing the interval to be cleared when needed.
- **Event Handlers**: Utilizes `useEvent` to create stable event handlers for starting, stopping, and clearing the timer.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Uses `useEffect` to ensure the interval is cleared when the component using the hook is unmounted, preventing memory leaks.

## References

- The `useTimer` hook is used in the `useAudioRecorder` hook, as seen in the related code snippet. It is used to track the recording time of an audio recording session.

## Dependencies

| Dependency            | Purpose                                      |
|:----------------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| `react-use-event-hook`| Provides the `useEvent` hook for stable event handlers. |

## Error Handling

The `useTimer` hook does not implement specific error handling mechanisms, as it primarily deals with simple state and interval management.

## Logging

The `useTimer` hook does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## Side Effects

- The `useEffect` hook ensures that the interval is cleared when the component using `useTimer` is unmounted, preventing potential memory leaks.

## Performance Considerations

- The timer updates every 100 milliseconds, which is a relatively frequent update interval. This should be considered in performance-sensitive applications, especially if multiple instances of the timer are used simultaneously.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
