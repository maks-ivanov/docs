## High-level description

The `useIsDragging` hook in the target file is a custom React hook designed to determine if a user is currently dragging an element. It incorporates a small offset to prevent accidental dragging, ensuring that only intentional drag actions are recognized. This hook is particularly useful in user interfaces where drag-and-drop functionality is implemented, such as in grid layouts or editors.

## Code Structure

The `useIsDragging` hook is composed of several state variables and event handlers that work together to track the dragging state. The main components are:

- State variables: `mouseIsDown`, `initialPosition`, and `isDragging`.
- Event handlers: `handleDragStart`, `handleDragMove`, and `handleDragStop`.

These components are interconnected to manage the drag state and provide a consistent interface for detecting drag actions.

### `useIsDragging`
#### Description
The `useIsDragging` hook provides a mechanism to detect whether a user is currently dragging an element. It uses mouse events to track the initial position of a drag and calculates the distance moved to determine if the drag exceeds a predefined offset, thus confirming a drag action.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | N/A  | The hook does not take any direct inputs. It relies on mouse events to function. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| isDragging | boolean | Indicates whether the user is currently dragging an element. |
| onDragStart | function | Event handler to be called when a drag action starts. |
| onDragMove | function | Event handler to be called when a drag action is in progress. |
| onDragStop | function | Event handler to be called when a drag action stops. |

#### Internal Logic
- **State Initialization**: Initializes `mouseIsDown`, `initialPosition`, and `isDragging` using React's `useState`.
- **handleDragStart**: Sets `mouseIsDown` to true and records the initial mouse position.
- **handleDragMove**: If `mouseIsDown` is true, calculates the distance moved from the initial position. If this distance exceeds the `OFFSET`, sets `isDragging` to true.
- **handleDragStop**: Resets `mouseIsDown` and `isDragging` to false, indicating the end of a drag action.

## References

The `useIsDragging` hook is used in the `GridLayoutRenderer` component within the `grid-layout.tsx` file. This component utilizes the hook to manage drag-and-drop interactions within a grid layout, ensuring that elements can be repositioned by the user.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Provides the `useState` hook for managing component state. |

## Error Handling

The `useIsDragging` hook does not implement specific error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the mouse events are correctly passed and handled.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The `useIsDragging` hook does not expose an API or public interface beyond the returned object containing `isDragging`, `onDragStart`, `onDragMove`, and `onDragStop`.
