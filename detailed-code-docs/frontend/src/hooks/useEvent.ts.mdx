title: "useEvent.ts"
---

## High-level description
The target file `useEvent.ts` is a simple module that re-exports a default export from the `react-use-event-hook` library. This file serves as a bridge to make the `useEvent` hook available for use in other parts of the application by importing it from this module.

## Code Structure
The file contains a single export statement that re-exports the default export from the `react-use-event-hook` library as `useEvent`. This allows other parts of the application to import `useEvent` directly from this file.

## Symbols

### `useEvent`
#### Description
The `useEvent` symbol is a re-export of the default export from the `react-use-event-hook` library. It is intended to be used as a hook in React components to handle events efficiently.

#### Inputs
The inputs for `useEvent` are not defined in this file, as it is a re-export. The inputs would be determined by the `react-use-event-hook` library's implementation of the `useEvent` hook.

#### Outputs
The outputs for `useEvent` are also not defined in this file, as it is a re-export. The outputs would be determined by the `react-use-event-hook` library's implementation of the `useEvent` hook.

## References
- `react-use-event-hook`: This is the library from which the `useEvent` hook is imported and re-exported. Understanding the functionality of `useEvent` requires looking at the documentation or source code of this library.
