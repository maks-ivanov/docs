## High-level description

The `useCellRenderCount` function is a custom hook designed to track the number of times a cell component is rendered in a React application. It is specifically intended for use in a testing environment, as indicated by the check for the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. The hook updates a data attribute on the `document.body` to keep count of cell renders.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in the code is the `useCellRenderCount` function. This function returns an object with a method `countRender`, which is responsible for incrementing the render count. The function is used in the `CellComponent` from the related file `Cell.tsx` to track how many times a cell is rendered.

## Symbols

### `useCellRenderCount`
#### Description
The `useCellRenderCount` function is a custom React hook that provides a mechanism to count the number of times a cell component is rendered. It is primarily used for testing purposes, as it only increments the count when the environment is set to "test".

#### Inputs
This function does not take any direct inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name        | Type       | Description                                      |
|:------------|:-----------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| countRender | Function   | A function that increments the cell render count.|

#### Internal Logic
- The function checks if the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to "test". If not, it exits early without performing any actions.
- It retrieves the current render count from the `document.body.dataset.cellRenderCount` attribute, defaulting to "0" if not set.
- It increments the count and updates the `document.body.dataset.cellRenderCount` attribute with the new value.

## References

- The `useCellRenderCount` function is used in the `CellComponent` within the `Cell.tsx` file. It is invoked to track the render count of cell components, which is useful for testing and debugging purposes.

## Dependencies

The code does not have any external dependencies, but it relies on the `document` object to store and update the render count.

## Error Handling

The code does not implement any specific error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the `document` object and its `dataset` property are available and writable.

## Side Effects

- The `countRender` function modifies the `document.body.dataset.cellRenderCount` attribute, which is a side effect that persists across renders and can be accessed globally within the document.

## Performance Considerations

- The function is lightweight and only performs operations when the environment is set to "test", minimizing its impact on performance in production environments.
