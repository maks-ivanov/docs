## High-level description

The `toggle.tsx` file defines a customizable toggle component using React and Radix UI's Toggle primitive. It leverages the `class-variance-authority` library to manage styling variants, allowing for different visual appearances and sizes of the toggle component. This component is designed to be flexible and reusable across different parts of a React application.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `Toggle` component and the `toggleVariants` styling configuration. The `Toggle` component is a React component that uses the `TogglePrimitive.Root` from Radix UI as its base. The `toggleVariants` is a configuration object created using `class-variance-authority` to define different styles for the toggle based on its variant and size.

## Symbols

### `toggleVariants`
#### Description
`toggleVariants` is a configuration object created using the `cva` function from the `class-variance-authority` library. It defines the styling rules for the toggle component, allowing for different visual styles based on the `variant` and `size` properties.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| variant | string | Determines the visual style of the toggle (e.g., "default", "outline"). |
| size | string | Determines the size of the toggle (e.g., "default", "xs", "sm", "lg"). |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | string | A string of class names that apply the appropriate styles based on the input properties. |

#### Internal Logic
The `toggleVariants` uses the `cva` function to define a set of base styles and variant-specific styles. It combines these styles using the `cn` utility function, which merges class names and resolves conflicts.

### `Toggle`
#### Description
The `Toggle` component is a React component that wraps the `TogglePrimitive.Root` from Radix UI. It applies the styles defined in `toggleVariants` and forwards refs and props to the underlying Radix UI component.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| className | string | Additional class names to apply to the toggle. |
| variant | string | The visual style variant of the toggle. |
| size | string | The size variant of the toggle. |
| props | object | Additional props to pass to the Radix UI TogglePrimitive.Root. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | JSX.Element | A JSX element representing the toggle component. |

#### Internal Logic
The `Toggle` component uses `React.forwardRef` to forward a ref to the `TogglePrimitive.Root`. It applies the class names generated by `toggleVariants` and any additional class names provided via the `className` prop. The component also spreads any additional props onto the `TogglePrimitive.Root`.

## References

- `TogglePrimitive.Root`: This is the base component from Radix UI that the `Toggle` component wraps.
- `cn`: A utility function from `@/utils/cn` that merges class names using `clsx` and `tailwind-merge`.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `react` | Provides the base library for building the component. |
| `@radix-ui/react-toggle` | Provides the Toggle primitive used as the base for the component. |
| `class-variance-authority` | Used to define and manage styling variants for the component. |
| `@/utils/cn` | Utility for merging class names. |
