## High-level description

The `fullscreen.tsx` file provides functionality to manage and utilize full-screen mode in a React application. It includes a custom hook to track the current full-screen element and a higher-order component (HOC) to wrap components, allowing them to use the full-screen element as their container when in full-screen mode.

## Code Structure

The file contains two main symbols: `useFullScreenElement` and `withFullScreenAsRoot`. The `useFullScreenElement` is a custom hook that tracks the current full-screen element, while `withFullScreenAsRoot` is a higher-order component that wraps a given component to use the full-screen element as its container if available.

## Symbols

### `useFullScreenElement`
#### Description
The `useFullScreenElement` function is a custom React hook that provides the current full-screen element. It updates the state whenever the full-screen mode changes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | N/A  | This hook does not take any direct inputs. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| fullScreenElement | `Element \| null` | The current full-screen element or `null` if not in full-screen mode. |

#### Internal Logic
- Initializes the state with the current `document.fullscreenElement`.
- Uses the `useEventListener` hook to listen for the `fullscreenchange` event on the document.
- Updates the state with the new `document.fullscreenElement` whenever the event is triggered.

### `withFullScreenAsRoot`
#### Description
The `withFullScreenAsRoot` function is a higher-order component that wraps a given component, allowing it to use the full-screen element as its container if the application is in full-screen mode.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Component | `React.ComponentType&lt;PortalProps&gt;` | The component to be wrapped by the HOC. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Comp | `React.ComponentType&lt;T&gt;` | The wrapped component that uses the full-screen element as its container if available. |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the `useFullScreenElement` hook to get the current full-screen element.
- If a full-screen element is present, it renders the wrapped component with the full-screen element as the container.
- If no full-screen element is present, it renders the wrapped component normally.

## References

- `useEventListener`: This hook is imported from `@/hooks/useEventListener` and is used to listen for the `fullscreenchange` event on the document.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@radix-ui/react-popover` | Provides type definitions for `PortalProps`. |
| `react` | Used for React components and hooks like `useState`. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors, but it ensures that the event listener is only added if the target is valid.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in this code.

## API/Interface Reference

The code does not expose any API endpoints or interfaces. It provides a hook and a higher-order component for internal use within a React application.
