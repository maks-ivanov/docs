## High-level description

The `sheet.tsx` file defines a set of React components that implement a customizable and animated sheet UI element, similar to a modal or drawer. These components leverage the Radix UI library for dialog primitives and provide additional styling and behavior customization through class variance and utility functions. The sheet components are designed to be flexible, supporting different positions on the screen and various content configurations.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are interconnected as follows:
- `Sheet`, `SheetTrigger`, `SheetClose`, `SheetPortal`, `SheetOverlay`, `SheetContent`, `SheetHeader`, `SheetFooter`, `SheetTitle`, and `SheetDescription` are all components that together form the sheet UI.
- `SheetPortal` is a higher-order component that uses `withFullScreenAsRoot` to potentially render the sheet in a full-screen context.
- `SheetOverlay` and `SheetContent` are styled using the `cn` utility function and `class-variance-authority` to apply conditional styles based on the sheet's state and position.

## References

- `@radix-ui/react-dialog`: Provides the base dialog primitives used to construct the sheet components.
- `@radix-ui/react-icons`: Supplies the `Cross2Icon` used in the `SheetClose` component.
- `class-variance-authority`: Used to define and manage style variants for the sheet components.
- `cn` utility function: Combines and merges class names for styling purposes.
- `withFullScreenAsRoot`: A higher-order component that adapts the sheet to full-screen mode if applicable.

## Symbols

### `Sheet`
#### Description
Represents the root component of the sheet, serving as a container for other sheet-related components.

### `SheetTrigger`
#### Description
Acts as a trigger element to open the sheet. It is a wrapper around the `SheetPrimitive.Trigger` component from Radix UI.

### `SheetClose`
#### Description
Provides a button to close the sheet, utilizing the `SheetPrimitive.Close` component and displaying a close icon.

### `SheetPortal`
#### Description
Wraps the `SheetPrimitive.Portal` component to potentially render the sheet in a full-screen context using the `withFullScreenAsRoot` higher-order component.

### `SheetOverlay`
#### Description
Renders an overlay behind the sheet, providing a backdrop effect. It uses the `cn` utility to apply styles based on the sheet's state.

#### Inputs
| Name      | Type   | Description                  |
|:----------|:-------|:-----------------------------|
| className | string | Additional class names to apply to the overlay. |
| props     | object | Additional props passed to the overlay component. |

### `SheetContent`
#### Description
Defines the main content area of the sheet, supporting different positions and animations. It uses `sheetVariants` to apply styles based on the `side` prop.

#### Inputs
| Name      | Type   | Description                  |
|:----------|:-------|:-----------------------------|
| side      | string | The side of the screen where the sheet appears (e.g., "top", "bottom", "left", "right"). |
| className | string | Additional class names to apply to the content. |
| children  | node   | The content to render inside the sheet. |
| props     | object | Additional props passed to the content component. |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `SheetPortal` to render the content.
- Applies styles using `sheetVariants` based on the `side` prop.
- Includes a `SheetClose` button for closing the sheet.

### `SheetHeader`
#### Description
Renders a header section within the sheet, typically used for titles or introductory content.

#### Inputs
| Name      | Type   | Description                  |
|:----------|:-------|:-----------------------------|
| className | string | Additional class names to apply to the header. |
| props     | object | Additional props passed to the header component. |

### `SheetFooter`
#### Description
Renders a footer section within the sheet, often used for action buttons or links.

#### Inputs
| Name      | Type   | Description                  |
|:----------|:-------|:-----------------------------|
| className | string | Additional class names to apply to the footer. |
| props     | object | Additional props passed to the footer component. |

### `SheetTitle`
#### Description
Displays a title within the sheet, styled with a larger font and bold text.

#### Inputs
| Name      | Type   | Description                  |
|:----------|:-------|:-----------------------------|
| className | string | Additional class names to apply to the title. |
| props     | object | Additional props passed to the title component. |

### `SheetDescription`
#### Description
Provides a description or subtitle within the sheet, styled with a smaller, muted font.

#### Inputs
| Name      | Type   | Description                  |
|:----------|:-------|:-----------------------------|
| className | string | Additional class names to apply to the description. |
| props     | object | Additional props passed to the description component. |
