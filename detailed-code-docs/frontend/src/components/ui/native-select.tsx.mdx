## High-level description

The `native-select.tsx` file defines a React component called `NativeSelect`, which is a styled HTML `&lt;select&gt;` element. This component is designed to be used in a React application to provide a consistent and customizable dropdown selection interface. It leverages utility functions and styles to ensure a cohesive look and feel across the application.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `NativeSelect` component and the `selectStyles` constant. The `selectStyles` constant defines the styling for the `NativeSelect` component using the `class-variance-authority` library. The `NativeSelect` component is a functional component that uses `React.forwardRef` to allow for ref forwarding, making it easier to integrate with other React components and libraries.

## Symbols

### `selectStyles`
#### Description
`selectStyles` is a constant that defines the CSS styles for the `NativeSelect` component. It uses the `cva` function from the `class-variance-authority` library to create a set of styles with variants and default variants.

#### Inputs
- None directly, but it is used to style the `NativeSelect` component.

#### Outputs
- Returns a function that can be used to generate class names based on the specified variants.

#### Internal Logic
The `selectStyles` constant defines a base set of styles for the `NativeSelect` component, including layout, typography, and interaction states. It also defines two variants: `default` and `ghost`, each with specific styles for different states like hover and focus.

### `NativeSelect`
#### Description
`NativeSelect` is a React component that renders a styled HTML `&lt;select&gt;` element. It is designed to be used as a dropdown selection component in a React application, providing a consistent and customizable user interface.

#### Inputs
| Name      | Type                                           | Description                                      |
|:----------|:----------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| className | `string`                                       | Additional class names to apply to the component.|
| children  | `React.ReactNode`                              | The options to be rendered within the `&lt;select&gt;`.|
| props     | `React.InputHTMLAttributes&lt;HTMLSelectElement&gt;` | Additional props to be passed to the `&lt;select&gt;`. |
| ref       | `React.Ref&lt;HTMLSelectElement&gt;`                 | Ref to be forwarded to the `&lt;select&gt;` element.   |

#### Outputs
- Renders a `&lt;select&gt;` element with the specified children and props.

#### Internal Logic
The `NativeSelect` component uses `React.forwardRef` to forward refs to the underlying `&lt;select&gt;` element. It applies the `selectStyles` and any additional class names provided via the `className` prop. The component also uses the `Events.stopPropagation` utility to prevent event propagation when the `&lt;select&gt;` is clicked.
