## High-level description

The `badge.tsx` file defines a reusable `Badge` component in a React application. This component is styled using a utility for managing class variance, allowing it to support multiple visual variants. The `Badge` component is designed to be flexible and customizable, making it suitable for displaying small pieces of information or status indicators in a user interface.

## Code Structure

- The `badgeVariants` constant is defined using the `cva` function from the `class-variance-authority` library. It specifies different styling options for the badge component based on the `variant` prop.
- The `BadgeProps` interface extends standard HTML attributes for a `div` element and includes variant properties from `badgeVariants`.
- The `Badge` component is a functional React component that renders a `div` element with styles determined by the `badgeVariants` and any additional class names passed via props.

## Symbols

### `badgeVariants`
#### Description
`badgeVariants` is a configuration object created using the `cva` function. It defines the base styles and variant-specific styles for the `Badge` component. The variants include `default`, `defaultOutline`, `secondary`, `destructive`, `success`, and `outline`.

#### Internal Logic
- The base styles include properties for layout, border, text, and focus states.
- Each variant specifies different background, border, and text colors.
- The `defaultVariants` property sets the default variant to `default`.

### `BadgeProps`
#### Description
`BadgeProps` is a TypeScript interface that extends `React.HTMLAttributes&lt;HTMLDivElement&gt;` and `VariantProps&lt;typeof badgeVariants&gt;`. It defines the properties that can be passed to the `Badge` component, including standard HTML attributes and variant-specific properties.

### `Badge`
#### Description
The `Badge` component is a React functional component that renders a styled `div` element. It uses the `cn` utility to merge class names from `badgeVariants` and any additional class names provided via props.

#### Inputs
| Name      | Type   | Description                                      |
|:----------|:-------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| className | string | Additional class names to apply to the component |
| variant   | string | The variant style to apply to the badge          |
| props     | BadgeProps | Additional props to pass to the `div` element |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| -    | JSX  | A styled `div` element representing the badge |

#### Internal Logic
- The component uses the `cn` function to combine the class names from `badgeVariants` and any additional class names.
- It spreads any additional props onto the `div` element, allowing for further customization.

## References

- The `Badge` component is used in other components like `FilterPills`, `Combobox`, and `VariableName` to display styled labels or indicators.
- The `cn` utility function is used to merge class names, ensuring that styles are applied correctly.
