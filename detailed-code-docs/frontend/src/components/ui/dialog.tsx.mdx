## High-level description

The `dialog.tsx` file defines a set of React components that provide a customizable dialog interface using the Radix UI library. These components include various parts of a dialog, such as the trigger, portal, overlay, content, header, footer, title, and description. The file leverages utility functions and hooks to enhance the dialog's functionality, such as focus restoration and full-screen handling.

## Code Structure

The main components in this file are interconnected to form a complete dialog system. The `Dialog` component serves as the root, while `DialogTrigger`, `DialogPortal`, `DialogOverlay`, `DialogContent`, `DialogHeader`, `DialogFooter`, `DialogTitle`, and `DialogDescription` are used to build the dialog's structure. The `DialogPortal` component is enhanced with a higher-order component to handle full-screen mode, and the `DialogContent` component uses a custom hook to manage focus restoration.

## Symbols

### `Dialog`
#### Description
The `Dialog` component is a wrapper around the `DialogPrimitive.Root` from the Radix UI library, serving as the root component for the dialog.

### `DialogTrigger`
#### Description
The `DialogTrigger` component is a wrapper around the `DialogPrimitive.Trigger`, used to open the dialog when interacted with.

### `DialogPortal`
#### Description
The `DialogPortal` component wraps the `DialogPrimitive.Portal` and is enhanced with the `withFullScreenAsRoot` higher-order component to use the full-screen element as the container if the dialog is in full-screen mode.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| className | string | Additional CSS classes for styling. |
| children | ReactNode | The content to be rendered inside the portal. |

### `DialogOverlay`
#### Description
The `DialogOverlay` component is a wrapper around the `DialogPrimitive.Overlay`, providing a semi-transparent background that covers the screen when the dialog is open.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| className | string | Additional CSS classes for styling. |

### `DialogContent`
#### Description
The `DialogContent` component is a wrapper around the `DialogPrimitive.Content`, which contains the main content of the dialog. It uses the `useRestoreFocus` hook to manage focus restoration when the dialog is closed.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| className | string | Additional CSS classes for styling. |
| children | ReactNode | The content to be rendered inside the dialog. |
| usePortal | boolean | Determines whether to use a portal for rendering. |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the `useRestoreFocus` hook to store the last focused element and restore focus when the dialog closes.
- Conditionally renders the content inside a `DialogPortal` based on the `usePortal` prop.

### `DialogHeader`
#### Description
The `DialogHeader` component is a simple wrapper for the header section of the dialog, allowing additional styling through the `className` prop.

### `DialogFooter`
#### Description
The `DialogFooter` component is a simple wrapper for the footer section of the dialog, allowing additional styling through the `className` prop.

### `DialogTitle`
#### Description
The `DialogTitle` component is a wrapper around the `DialogPrimitive.Title`, used to display the title of the dialog.

### `DialogDescription`
#### Description
The `DialogDescription` component is a wrapper around the `DialogPrimitive.Description`, used to display a description or additional information in the dialog.
