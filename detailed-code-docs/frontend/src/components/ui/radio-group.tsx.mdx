## High-level description

The target file defines two React components, `RadioGroup` and `RadioGroupItem`, which are custom implementations of radio button groups using the Radix UI library. These components are designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing developers to easily integrate radio button functionality into their React applications with additional styling and behavior enhancements.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `RadioGroup` and `RadioGroupItem` components. Both components utilize the Radix UI library's `RadioGroupPrimitive` components as their base and extend them with additional styling and properties. The `cn` utility function is used to merge and apply class names for styling purposes.

## Symbols

### `RadioGroup`
#### Description
The `RadioGroup` component is a wrapper around the `RadioGroupPrimitive.Root` component from the Radix UI library. It provides a customizable radio group container that can be styled and extended with additional properties.

#### Inputs
| Name      | Type   | Description                              |
|:----------|:-------|:-----------------------------------------|
| className | string | Additional class names for styling.      |
| props     | object | Additional properties for the component. |
| ref       | ref    | A reference to the component instance.   |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| -    | JSX  | The rendered radio group component. |

#### Internal Logic
The `RadioGroup` component uses the `cn` utility function to merge the provided `className` with default styles. It then renders the `RadioGroupPrimitive.Root` component with the merged class names and any additional props.

### `RadioGroupItem`
#### Description
The `RadioGroupItem` component is a custom radio button item that extends the `RadioGroupPrimitive.Item` component from the Radix UI library. It includes additional styling and an indicator for the selected state.

#### Inputs
| Name      | Type   | Description                              |
|:----------|:-------|:-----------------------------------------|
| className | string | Additional class names for styling.      |
| children  | node   | Child elements to be rendered inside the item. |
| props     | object | Additional properties for the component. |
| ref       | ref    | A reference to the component instance.   |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| -    | JSX  | The rendered radio group item component. |

#### Internal Logic
The `RadioGroupItem` component uses the `cn` utility function to merge the provided `className` with default styles, including styles for different states (e.g., checked, unchecked). It renders the `RadioGroupPrimitive.Item` component with the merged class names and any additional props. The `RadioGroupPrimitive.Indicator` is used to display a visual indicator (a circle) when the item is selected.

## References

- `RadioGroupPrimitive.Root` and `RadioGroupPrimitive.Item` from the Radix UI library are used as the base components for `RadioGroup` and `RadioGroupItem`.
- The `cn` utility function from `@/utils/cn` is used to merge class names.

## Dependencies

| Dependency          | Purpose                                      |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| `@radix-ui/react-radio-group` | Provides the base radio group components. |
| `lucide-react`      | Provides the `Circle` icon used as an indicator. |
| `@/utils/cn`        | Utility for merging class names.             |

## Error Handling

The code does not implement specific error handling mechanisms beyond basic React component rendering.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The `RadioGroup` and `RadioGroupItem` components do not expose an API beyond their React component interfaces. They are intended to be used as part of a React application, where they can be customized and integrated into the UI.
