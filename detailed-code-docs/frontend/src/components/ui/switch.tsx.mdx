## High-level description

The `switch.tsx` file defines a customizable and reusable `Switch` component using React and Radix UI's Switch primitives. This component is styled using the `class-variance-authority` library to allow for different size variants and integrates with utility functions for class name management. The component is designed to be easily integrated into other parts of the application, providing a consistent UI element for toggling states.

## Code Structure

- The `Switch` component is the main export of this file.
- It uses Radix UI's `SwitchPrimitives.Root` and `SwitchPrimitives.Thumb` to create the switch's structure.
- The `cva` function from `class-variance-authority` is used to define style variants for the switch and its thumb.
- The `cn` utility function is used to merge class names.

## Symbols

### `switchVariants`
#### Description
Defines the style variants for the switch component, including default and small sizes. It uses the `cva` function to manage class names based on the component's state and size.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| size | string | Determines the size of the switch, either "default" or "sm". |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | string | A string of class names based on the provided size and state. |

### `switchThumbVariants`
#### Description
Defines the style variants for the switch's thumb, similar to `switchVariants`, but specifically for the thumb element. It also uses the `cva` function to manage class names based on the component's state and size.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| size | string | Determines the size of the thumb, either "default" or "sm". |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | string | A string of class names based on the provided size and state. |

### `Switch`
#### Description
A React component that renders a switch UI element. It forwards refs and accepts additional props, allowing for flexible integration into other components. The component uses Radix UI primitives and applies styles based on the defined variants.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| className | string | Additional class names to apply to the switch. |
| size | string | The size variant of the switch, either "default" or "sm". |
| props | object | Additional props to pass to the Radix UI `SwitchPrimitives.Root`. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | JSX.Element | A JSX element representing the switch. |

#### Internal Logic
- The component uses `React.forwardRef` to allow ref forwarding.
- It applies class names using the `cn` utility, combining the variant styles with any additional class names.
- The `SwitchPrimitives.Root` and `SwitchPrimitives.Thumb` are used to construct the switch, with the thumb being a child of the root.

## References

- `SwitchPrimitives.Root` and `SwitchPrimitives.Thumb` from `@radix-ui/react-switch` are used to create the switch structure.
- The `cn` function from `@/utils/cn` is used to merge class names.
- The `cva` function from `class-variance-authority` is used to define style variants.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@radix-ui/react-switch` | Provides the base switch components used to build the custom switch. |
| `class-variance-authority` | Used to define and manage style variants for the switch component. |
| `@/utils/cn` | Utility function for merging class names. |
