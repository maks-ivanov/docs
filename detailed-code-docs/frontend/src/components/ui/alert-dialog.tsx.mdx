## High-level description

The `alert-dialog.tsx` file defines a set of React components that provide a customizable alert dialog interface using the Radix UI library. These components are designed to be used in a React application to display modal dialogs with various configurations, such as titles, descriptions, actions, and cancel options. The file leverages utility functions and styles to ensure consistent appearance and behavior across different dialog instances.

## Code Structure

The main components in this file are interconnected to form a complete alert dialog system. The `AlertDialog` component serves as the root, while other components like `AlertDialogTrigger`, `AlertDialogContent`, `AlertDialogHeader`, `AlertDialogFooter`, `AlertDialogTitle`, `AlertDialogDescription`, `AlertDialogAction`, `AlertDialogDestructiveAction`, and `AlertDialogCancel` are used to build the structure and functionality of the dialog. These components are styled and configured using utility functions and Radix UI primitives.

## Symbols

### `AlertDialog`
#### Description
The `AlertDialog` component acts as the root component for the alert dialog. It is a wrapper around the `AlertDialogPrimitive.Root` from Radix UI, providing the foundational structure for the dialog.

### `AlertDialogTrigger`
#### Description
The `AlertDialogTrigger` component is used to open the alert dialog. It wraps the `AlertDialogPrimitive.Trigger` from Radix UI, allowing any child component to act as a trigger for the dialog.

### `AlertDialogPortal`
#### Description
The `AlertDialogPortal` component is a wrapper around the `AlertDialogPrimitive.Portal` that uses the `withFullScreenAsRoot` higher-order component to ensure the dialog is displayed correctly in full-screen mode. It positions the dialog in the viewport.

### `AlertDialogOverlay`
#### Description
The `AlertDialogOverlay` component provides a semi-transparent background overlay for the dialog. It uses `React.forwardRef` to pass a ref to the `AlertDialogPrimitive.Overlay`, allowing for additional styling and properties.

### `AlertDialogContent`
#### Description
The `AlertDialogContent` component contains the main content of the dialog. It uses `React.forwardRef` to pass a ref to the `AlertDialogPrimitive.Content` and includes logic to restore focus to the previously focused element when the dialog closes.

#### Internal Logic
- Utilizes the `useRestoreFocus` hook to manage focus restoration.
- Wraps content in `AlertDialogPortal` and `AlertDialogOverlay` for proper display.

### `AlertDialogHeader`
#### Description
The `AlertDialogHeader` component is used to display the header section of the dialog, typically containing the title and description. It is styled using utility functions for consistent appearance.

### `AlertDialogFooter`
#### Description
The `AlertDialogFooter` component is used to display the footer section of the dialog, typically containing action buttons like confirm and cancel.

### `AlertDialogTitle`
#### Description
The `AlertDialogTitle` component displays the title of the dialog. It uses `React.forwardRef` to pass a ref to the `AlertDialogPrimitive.Title`.

### `AlertDialogDescription`
#### Description
The `AlertDialogDescription` component displays a description or additional information in the dialog. It uses `React.forwardRef` to pass a ref to the `AlertDialogPrimitive.Description`.

### `AlertDialogAction`
#### Description
The `AlertDialogAction` component represents a confirm action button within the dialog. It uses `React.forwardRef` to pass a ref to the `AlertDialogPrimitive.Action` and applies button styles.

### `AlertDialogDestructiveAction`
#### Description
The `AlertDialogDestructiveAction` component is a variant of `AlertDialogAction` styled for destructive actions, such as deletions. It applies a "destructive" variant style to the button.

### `AlertDialogCancel`
#### Description
The `AlertDialogCancel` component represents a cancel action button within the dialog. It uses `React.forwardRef` to pass a ref to the `AlertDialogPrimitive.Cancel` and applies secondary button styles.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@radix-ui/react-alert-dialog` | Provides the base components for creating alert dialogs. |
| `React` | Used for creating React components and hooks. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors within the components, as it primarily focuses on rendering UI elements. Error handling would typically be managed at a higher level in the application where these components are used.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented within this file. Logging would be handled at a higher level in the application if needed.

## API/Interface Reference

The file does not define an API or public interface beyond the exported React components, which are intended to be used within a React application to create alert dialogs.
