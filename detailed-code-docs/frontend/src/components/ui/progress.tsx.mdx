## High-level description

The `progress.tsx` file defines a React component named `Progress` that serves as a customizable progress bar. It leverages the `@radix-ui/react-progress` library to create a progress bar with a smooth transition effect, and it uses utility functions to manage CSS class names for styling.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in this file is the `Progress` component, which is a React component created using `React.forwardRef`. It utilizes the `ProgressPrimitive.Root` and `ProgressPrimitive.Indicator` from the `@radix-ui/react-progress` library to construct the progress bar. The `cn` utility function is used to merge and manage CSS class names for styling purposes.

## Symbols

### `Progress`
#### Description
The `Progress` component is a React component that renders a progress bar. It uses the `@radix-ui/react-progress` library to provide the basic structure and behavior of the progress bar, and it applies custom styles using Tailwind CSS classes. The component supports a `value` prop to indicate the progress percentage and allows additional props and class names to be passed for further customization.

#### Inputs
| Name      | Type   | Description                                      |
|:----------|:-------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| className | string | Additional CSS class names for custom styling.   |
| value     | number | The progress value as a percentage (0 to 100).   |
| props     | object | Additional props to be passed to the component.  |
| ref       | ref    | A ref to be forwarded to the root element.       |

#### Outputs
| Name   | Type   | Description                                      |
|:-------|:-------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| JSX    | JSX.Element | The rendered progress bar component.         |

#### Internal Logic
- The `Progress` component is defined using `React.forwardRef` to allow ref forwarding.
- It uses `ProgressPrimitive.Root` as the root element of the progress bar, applying a set of default and custom styles using the `cn` utility function.
- The `ProgressPrimitive.Indicator` is used to visually represent the progress, with its width adjusted based on the `value` prop.
- The `style` attribute of the `Indicator` is dynamically set to translate its position based on the progress value, creating a smooth transition effect.

## Error Handling

The component does not implement specific error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the `value` prop is a valid number between 0 and 100.

## Logging

The component does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The `Progress` component does not expose an API or public interface beyond its props. It is intended to be used as a UI component within a React application.
