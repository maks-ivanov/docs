## High-level description

The `tooltip.tsx` file defines a set of React components that provide a tooltip functionality using the Radix UI library. It includes components for creating tooltips with customizable content, positioning, and behavior, and integrates with a style namespace to ensure consistent styling across the application.

## Code Structure

The main components in this file are interconnected to provide a complete tooltip functionality:
- `TooltipProvider` is used to wrap the tooltip components and manage their state.
- `TooltipRoot`, `TooltipTrigger`, and `TooltipContent` are used together to define the structure of a tooltip, where `TooltipTrigger` is the element that triggers the tooltip, and `TooltipContent` is the content displayed in the tooltip.
- `TooltipContent` is a forward-ref component that allows for additional customization and styling through props.

## Symbols

### `TooltipProvider`
#### Description
The `TooltipProvider` component is a wrapper that provides context for managing the state of tooltips within its children. It is imported from the `@radix-ui/react-tooltip` library and is used to ensure that tooltips behave consistently across the application.

### `TooltipRoot`
#### Description
The `TooltipRoot` component serves as the root element for a tooltip. It is a part of the Radix UI tooltip primitives and is used to group the `TooltipTrigger` and `TooltipContent` components together.

### `TooltipTrigger`
#### Description
The `TooltipTrigger` component is used to define the element that, when interacted with (e.g., hovered or focused), will trigger the display of the tooltip. It is a part of the Radix UI tooltip primitives.

### `TooltipContent`
#### Description
The `TooltipContent` component is a forward-ref React component that defines the content of the tooltip. It allows for customization of the tooltip's appearance and behavior through props such as `className` and `sideOffset`.

#### Inputs
| Name       | Type   | Description                                                                 |
|:-----------|:-------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| className  | string | Additional CSS classes for styling the tooltip content.                      |
| sideOffset | number | The offset distance from the trigger element to the tooltip content.         |
| props      | object | Additional props passed to the `TooltipPrimitive.Content` component.         |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| -    | JSX  | The rendered tooltip content component. |

#### Internal Logic
- The component uses `React.forwardRef` to pass a ref to the `TooltipPrimitive.Content` component.
- It applies a set of default styles and merges them with any additional classes provided via the `className` prop using the `cn` utility function.
- The `sideOffset` prop is used to control the distance between the tooltip and its trigger element.

|:----------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `@radix-ui/react-tooltip`   | Provides the tooltip primitives used to build the tooltip components.   |
| `React`                     | Used for creating React components and managing component state.        |
| `cn`                        | Utility function for merging and applying CSS class names.              |
| `StyleNamespace`            | Component used to apply a consistent style namespace to the tooltip.    |

## References

- The `cn` utility function is imported from `@/utils/cn` and is used to merge class names.
- The `StyleNamespace` component is imported from `@/theme/namespace` and is used to wrap the `TooltipContent` to ensure consistent styling.

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors, as it primarily deals with rendering UI components. Any errors related to rendering or props would be handled by React's error boundaries or during the development process.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in this code, as it focuses on UI rendering without any complex logic that requires logging.
