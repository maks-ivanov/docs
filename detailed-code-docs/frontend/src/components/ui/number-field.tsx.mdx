## High-level description

The `number-field.tsx` file defines a React component named `NumberField`, which is a customizable input field for handling numeric values. It leverages the `react-aria-components` library to provide accessibility features and includes increment and decrement buttons for adjusting the numeric value. The component is designed to be flexible, allowing for additional properties such as placeholders and disabled states.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `NumberField` component and the `StepperButton` component. The `NumberField` component is the primary export and is responsible for rendering the numeric input field along with the increment and decrement buttons. The `StepperButton` component is a helper component used within `NumberField` to render the buttons for incrementing and decrementing the numeric value.

## Symbols

### `NumberField`
#### Description
The `NumberField` component is a React component that provides a numeric input field with increment and decrement buttons. It is built on top of the `AriaNumberField` from the `react-aria-components` library, ensuring accessibility compliance. The component allows for customization through props such as `placeholder` and `isDisabled`.

#### Inputs
| Name        | Type                | Description                              |
|:------------|:--------------------|:-----------------------------------------|
| placeholder | string (optional)   | Placeholder text for the input field.    |
| props       | NumberFieldProps    | Additional properties for customization. |
| ref         | React.Ref&lt;HTMLInputElement&gt; | Reference to the input element. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX  | JSX.Element | The rendered number field component. |

#### Internal Logic
- The component uses the `AriaNumberField` to wrap the input field and buttons, ensuring accessibility.
- The `RACInput` component is used for the input field, with event handling to stop propagation of arrow key events.
- The `StepperButton` component is used to render the increment and decrement buttons, utilizing icons from `lucide-react`.
- The `cn` utility function is used to merge and apply CSS classes for styling.

### `StepperButton`
#### Description
The `StepperButton` component is a helper component used within the `NumberField` to render the increment and decrement buttons. It applies specific styles and handles the disabled state.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type       | Description                        |
|:-----|:-----------|:-----------------------------------|
| props | ButtonProps | Properties for the button component. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX  | JSX.Element | The rendered button component. |

#### Internal Logic
- The component uses the `Button` component from `react-aria-components` to render a button with specific styles.
- The `cn` utility function is used to apply conditional styles based on the `isDisabled` prop.

## References

- The `NumberField` component is used in other parts of the codebase, such as in the `UserConfigForm` component in `user-config-form.tsx`, where it is used to handle numeric inputs for user configuration settings.
- The `cn` utility function from `utils/cn.ts` is used for class name merging and styling.

## Dependencies

| Dependency         | Purpose                                      |
|:-------------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| `react-aria-components` | Provides accessible components for the UI. |
| `lucide-react`     | Provides icons used in the increment and decrement buttons. |
| `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` | Used in the `cn` utility function for class name management. |
