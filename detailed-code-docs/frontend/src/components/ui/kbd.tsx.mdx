## High-level description

The target file defines a React functional component `Kbd` that is used to render keyboard shortcut keys in a stylized manner. It utilizes the `clsx` library to conditionally apply CSS classes for styling the `&lt;kbd&gt;` HTML element, which is typically used to denote user input via the keyboard.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in this file is the `Kbd` component, which is a React functional component. It takes in props defined by the `Props` interface and returns a JSX element. The `clsx` library is used to manage the CSS class names applied to the component.

## Symbols

### `Kbd`
#### Description
The `Kbd` component is a React functional component designed to render its children within a `&lt;kbd&gt;` HTML element, applying specific styles to visually represent keyboard input. It uses the `clsx` library to combine any additional class names passed via props with a set of predefined styles.

#### Inputs
| Name      | Type             | Description                                      |
|:----------|:-----------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| className | string (optional)| Additional CSS class names to apply to the element. |
| children  | React.ReactNode  | The content to be displayed within the `&lt;kbd&gt;` element. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX  | JSX.Element | A styled `&lt;kbd&gt;` element containing the children. |

#### Internal Logic
- The component uses the `clsx` library to merge the `className` prop with a set of predefined CSS classes. These classes include styles for rounded corners, background color, padding, font size, and border, among others.
- The `children` prop is rendered inside the `&lt;kbd&gt;` element, allowing any nested content to be displayed with the specified styles.

## References

- The `Kbd` component is imported and used in other parts of the codebase, such as in `user-config-form.tsx` and `renderShortcut.tsx`, to display keyboard shortcuts or instructions in a consistent and stylized manner.

## Dependencies
