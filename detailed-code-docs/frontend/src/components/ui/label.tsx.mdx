## High-level description

The `label.tsx` file defines a React component named `Label` that is a styled wrapper around the `LabelPrimitive.Root` component from the `@radix-ui/react-label` library. It uses the `class-variance-authority` library to apply consistent styling variants to the label component, allowing for customization and integration with other UI components.

## Code Structure

- The `Label` component is created using `React.forwardRef` to allow for ref forwarding, which is useful for accessing the DOM node directly.
- The `labelVariants` constant is defined using the `cva` function from `class-variance-authority` to specify default styles for the label, such as font size, weight, and behavior when disabled.
- The `cn` utility function is used to merge class names, allowing for additional custom class names to be passed in and combined with the default styles.

## Symbols

### `Label`
#### Description
The `Label` component is a styled label element that can be used in forms and other UI components. It leverages the `@radix-ui/react-label` library for accessibility and functionality, while applying custom styles through the `class-variance-authority` library.

#### Inputs
| Name      | Type   | Description                                                                 |
|:----------|:-------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| className | string | Additional class names to apply to the label for custom styling.            |
| props     | object | Other props that are passed to the underlying `LabelPrimitive.Root` element.|
| ref       | ref    | A ref to the DOM element, allowing for direct DOM manipulation if needed.   |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| -    | JSX  | Returns a JSX element representing the styled label. |

#### Internal Logic
- The `Label` component uses `React.forwardRef` to pass a ref to the `LabelPrimitive.Root` component.
- It combines the default styles from `labelVariants` with any additional class names provided via the `className` prop using the `cn` utility function.
- The component spreads any additional props onto the `LabelPrimitive.Root` component, allowing for flexible usage.

## References

- **`LabelPrimitive.Root`**: The base component from the `@radix-ui/react-label` library that provides the core label functionality.
- **`cva`**: A function from the `class-variance-authority` library used to define style variants.
- **`cn`**: A utility function for merging class names, imported from `@/utils/cn`.

| `@radix-ui/react-label`         | Provides the base label component with accessibility features.          |
| `class-variance-authority`      | Used to define and manage style variants for the label component.       |
| `@/utils/cn`                    | Utility function for merging class names, ensuring consistent styling.  |

## Side Effects
There are no notable side effects in this component as it primarily deals with rendering a styled label element.

## Performance Considerations
The component is lightweight and primarily involves styling, so there are no significant performance considerations. However, using `React.forwardRef` allows for potential optimizations in scenarios where direct DOM access is required.
