## High-level description

The `button.tsx` file defines a customizable Button component for a React application. It utilizes the `class-variance-authority` library to manage different button styles and variants, allowing for a flexible and reusable button component that can be styled according to various states and purposes. The component supports different variants, sizes, and an optional `asChild` prop to render the button as a different component.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `Button` component and the `buttonVariants` function. The `buttonVariants` function is responsible for generating the CSS classes based on the button's variant and size, while the `Button` component uses these classes to render a styled button element. The `ButtonProps` interface extends the standard HTML button attributes and includes additional properties for customization.

## Symbols

### `buttonVariants`
#### Description
The `buttonVariants` function generates a set of CSS classes for the button based on its variant and size. It uses the `class-variance-authority` library to define and manage these styles, allowing for consistent styling across different button states.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| variant | string | The style variant of the button (e.g., default, destructive, success, etc.) |
| size | string | The size of the button (e.g., default, xs, sm, lg, icon) |
| className | string | Additional custom classes to apply to the button |
| disabled | boolean | Whether the button is disabled |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | string | A string of CSS classes to apply to the button |

### `Button`
#### Description
The `Button` component is a React component that renders a button element with customizable styles and behaviors. It supports different variants, sizes, and an optional `asChild` prop to render the button as a different component, such as a link or a custom component.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| className | string | Additional custom classes to apply to the button |
| variant | string | The style variant of the button |
| size | string | The size of the button |
| asChild | boolean | Whether to render the button as a different component |
| props | React.ButtonHTMLAttributes&lt;HTMLButtonElement&gt; | Standard HTML button attributes |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | JSX.Element | A JSX element representing the button |

#### Internal Logic
The `Button` component uses the `React.forwardRef` function to forward refs to the underlying button element. It determines the component type to render based on the `asChild` prop, defaulting to a `button` element. The component applies the generated CSS classes from `buttonVariants` and any additional classes provided via the `className` prop.
