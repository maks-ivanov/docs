## High-level description

The `toaster.tsx` file defines a `Toaster` component that is responsible for rendering toast notifications in a React application. It utilizes a custom hook, `useToast`, to manage the state of the toasts and display them using various subcomponents like `Toast`, `ToastTitle`, `ToastDescription`, and others. The component is designed to be used within a `ToastProvider` context, which manages the lifecycle and display of toast notifications.

## Code Structure

The `Toaster` component is the main symbol in this file. It relies on the `useToast` hook to retrieve the current list of toasts and renders them using several subcomponents imported from the `toast.tsx` file. These subcomponents include `Toast`, `ToastTitle`, `ToastDescription`, `ToastClose`, and `ToastViewport`, which are used to structure and style each toast notification.

## References

- `useToast`: A custom hook imported from `use-toast.ts` that provides the state and actions for managing toasts.
- `Toast`, `ToastClose`, `ToastDescription`, `ToastProvider`, `ToastTitle`, `ToastViewport`: Components imported from `toast.tsx` that are used to render the individual parts of a toast notification.

## Symbols

### `Toaster`
#### Description
The `Toaster` component is responsible for rendering a list of toast notifications. It uses the `useToast` hook to access the current toasts and maps over them to render each toast using the `Toast` component and its subcomponents.

#### Inputs
None directly, but it uses the `useToast` hook to access the state of toasts.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React Element | The rendered list of toast notifications. |

#### Internal Logic
- The `Toaster` component calls the `useToast` hook to get the current list of toasts.
- It wraps the toast rendering logic inside a `ToastProvider` to manage the context for the toasts.
- It maps over the `toasts` array, rendering each toast with a unique `key` using the `Toast` component.
- For each toast, it conditionally renders a `ToastTitle` and `ToastDescription` if they are provided.
- It includes a `ToastClose` component to allow users to dismiss the toast.
- Finally, it renders a `ToastViewport` to define the area where toasts are displayed.

## Side Effects
- The `Toaster` component does not have direct side effects, but it relies on the `useToast` hook, which manages the state and lifecycle of toasts, including adding, updating, and removing them.
