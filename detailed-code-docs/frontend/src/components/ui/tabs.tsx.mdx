## High-level description

The target file `tabs.tsx` defines a set of React components that implement a tabbed interface using the Radix UI library. These components include `Tabs`, `TabsList`, `TabsTrigger`, and `TabsContent`, which are styled and configured to provide a flexible and accessible tabbed navigation system for a React application.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are interconnected as follows:
- `Tabs` is a component that acts as the root container for the tabbed interface.
- `TabsList` is a component that contains the list of tab triggers.
- `TabsTrigger` is a component that represents an individual tab that can be activated.
- `TabsContent` is a component that displays the content associated with a selected tab.
- The `cn` utility function is used to merge and conditionally apply CSS class names to these components.

## Symbols

### `Tabs`
#### Description
`Tabs` is a component that serves as the root container for the tabbed interface. It is a direct re-export of `TabsPrimitive.Root` from the Radix UI library.

### `TabsList`
#### Description
`TabsList` is a component that renders a list of tab triggers. It uses the `TabsPrimitive.List` component from Radix UI and applies additional styling.

#### Inputs
| Name      | Type   | Description                        |
|:----------|:-------|:-----------------------------------|
| className | string | Additional CSS classes to apply.   |
| props     | object | Other props passed to the component. |
| ref       | ref    | A ref to the underlying DOM element. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX  | JSX  | The rendered list of tab triggers. |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `React.forwardRef` to pass a ref to the underlying DOM element.
- Merges default and additional class names using the `cn` utility function.

### `TabsTrigger`
#### Description
`TabsTrigger` is a component that represents an individual tab trigger. It uses the `TabsPrimitive.Trigger` component from Radix UI and applies additional styling.

#### Inputs
| Name      | Type   | Description                        |
|:----------|:-------|:-----------------------------------|
| className | string | Additional CSS classes to apply.   |
| props     | object | Other props passed to the component. |
| ref       | ref    | A ref to the underlying DOM element. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX  | JSX  | The rendered tab trigger. |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `React.forwardRef` to pass a ref to the underlying DOM element.
- Merges default and additional class names using the `cn` utility function.

### `TabsContent`
#### Description
`TabsContent` is a component that displays the content associated with a selected tab. It uses the `TabsPrimitive.Content` component from Radix UI and applies additional styling.

#### Inputs
| Name      | Type   | Description                        |
|:----------|:-------|:-----------------------------------|
| className | string | Additional CSS classes to apply.   |
| props     | object | Other props passed to the component. |
| ref       | ref    | A ref to the underlying DOM element. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX  | JSX  | The rendered tab content. |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `React.forwardRef` to pass a ref to the underlying DOM element.
- Merges default and additional class names using the `cn` utility function.

## References

- The `cn` utility function from `utils/cn.ts` is used to merge and conditionally apply CSS class names.

## Dependencies

| Dependency          | Purpose                                      |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| `@radix-ui/react-tabs` | Provides the base tab components used in the implementation. |
| `React`             | Used for creating React components and managing refs. |
| `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` | Used in the `cn` utility function to handle class name merging. |

## Error Handling

The code does not implement specific error handling mechanisms beyond what is provided by React and the Radix UI library.

## Logging
