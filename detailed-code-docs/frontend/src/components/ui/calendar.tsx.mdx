## High-level description

The `calendar.tsx` file defines a `Calendar` component using React, which is a customizable calendar UI component built on top of the `react-day-picker` library. It provides a styled calendar interface with navigation buttons and various styling options, allowing users to select dates and view different months.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in this file is the `Calendar` component, which is a functional React component. It utilizes the `DayPicker` component from the `react-day-picker` library and customizes its appearance and behavior using props and class names. The component also imports utility functions and styles from other parts of the codebase to enhance its functionality and appearance.

## References

- `DayPicker` from `react-day-picker`: The core component used to render the calendar.
- `ChevronLeft` and `ChevronRight` from `lucide-react`: Icons used for navigation buttons.
- `cn` from `@/utils/cn`: A utility function for merging and managing class names.
- `buttonVariants` from `@/components/ui/button`: Provides styling variants for buttons used in the calendar.
