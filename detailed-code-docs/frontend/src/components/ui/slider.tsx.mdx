## High-level description

The `slider.tsx` file defines a customizable slider component using React and the Radix UI library. This component integrates a tooltip to display the current value of the slider, which can be transformed using a provided mapping function. The slider is designed to be flexible, supporting both horizontal and vertical orientations, and can be styled using additional class names.

## Code Structure

The main component in this file is the `Slider`, which is a React component that uses Radix UI's slider primitives. It incorporates a tooltip to display the slider's value, which is formatted using a utility function. The component also uses a custom hook to manage the tooltip's visibility state.

## References

- `@radix-ui/react-slider`: Provides the base slider components used to build the custom slider.
- `@radix-ui/react-tooltip`: Used for displaying tooltips.
- `useBoolean`: A custom hook for managing boolean state, used here to control tooltip visibility.
- `cn`: A utility function for merging class names.
- `prettyScientificNumber`: A utility function for formatting numbers in a readable scientific notation.

## Symbols

### `Slider`
#### Description
The `Slider` component is a forward-ref React component that wraps Radix UI's slider primitives to create a customizable slider with a tooltip. It allows for the transformation of slider values using a `valueMap` function and supports additional styling through class names.

#### Inputs
| Name     | Type   | Description                                                                 |
|:---------|:-------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| className| string | Additional class names for styling the slider.                              |
| valueMap | function | A function to transform the slider's value before displaying it in the tooltip. |
| props    | object | Additional props passed to the Radix UI slider root component.              |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Slider | React component | A slider component with integrated tooltip functionality. |

#### Internal Logic
- The component uses the `useBoolean` hook to manage the visibility of the tooltip.
- It renders a `SliderPrimitive.Root` component with a track and thumb, where the thumb is wrapped in a tooltip trigger.
- The tooltip displays the transformed slider value using the `valueMap` function and `prettyScientificNumber` for formatting.
- The component supports both horizontal and vertical orientations, adjusting its layout and styles accordingly.

## Side Effects
- The component modifies the tooltip's visibility state using the `useBoolean` hook.
