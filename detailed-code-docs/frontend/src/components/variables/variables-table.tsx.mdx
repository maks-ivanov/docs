## High-level description

The `variables-table.tsx` file defines a React component named `VariableTable` that displays a table of variables, including their names, types, values, and the cells that declare and use them. It leverages the `@tanstack/react-table` library for table functionalities such as sorting and filtering. The component is designed to be part of a larger application, likely a notebook or code editor, where variables are defined and used across different cells.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are interconnected as follows:
- `VariableTable` is the main React component that renders the table.
- `ResolvedVariable` is an interface that extends `Variable` to include additional properties for display purposes.
- `COLUMNS` is an array of column definitions used by the table to render different aspects of the variables.
- `sortData` is a function that sorts the variables based on the specified column and order.
- The component uses hooks like `useMemo` to optimize performance by memoizing computed values.

## Symbols

### `VariableTable`
#### Description
The `VariableTable` component is a React functional component that renders a table displaying information about variables, such as their names, types, values, and the cells that declare and use them. It supports sorting and filtering functionalities.

#### Inputs
| Name      | Type       | Description                           |
|:----------|:-----------|:--------------------------------------|
| className | string     | Optional CSS class for styling.       |
| cellIds   | CellId[]   | Array of cell IDs for sorting.        |
| variables | Variables  | Object containing variable data.      |

#### Outputs
The component does not return any outputs but renders a table in the UI.

#### Internal Logic
- **State Management**: Uses `useState` to manage sorting and filtering states.
- **Data Resolution**: Uses `useMemo` to resolve variables into a format suitable for display, including mapping cell IDs to names.
- **Sorting**: The `sortData` function is used to sort variables based on the selected column.
- **Table Configuration**: Configures the table using `useReactTable` from `@tanstack/react-table`, specifying data, columns, and sorting/filtering behaviors.
- **Rendering**: Renders a search input for filtering and a table with headers and rows, using `flexRender` to render cell content.

### `ResolvedVariable`
#### Description
`ResolvedVariable` is an interface that extends the `Variable` type to include additional properties `declaredByNames` and `usedByNames`, which are arrays of strings representing the names of cells that declare and use the variable, respectively.

#### Inputs
This is a type definition and does not take inputs directly.

#### Outputs
This is a type definition and does not produce outputs directly.

- `DataTableColumnHeader`: Used for rendering column headers with sorting and filtering capabilities.
- `CellLink` and `CellLinkList`: Used for rendering links to cells that declare or use the variables.
- `useReactTable`: A hook from `@tanstack/react-table` used to configure and manage the table's state and behavior.
- `getCellEditorView` and `goToVariableDefinition`: Functions used to interact with the cell editor, particularly for highlighting variable definitions.

## Error Handling

The component does not explicitly handle errors beyond basic React error boundaries. It assumes that the data provided to it is valid and correctly formatted.

## Logging

The component does not implement any logging mechanisms.
