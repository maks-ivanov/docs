## High-level description

The `frontend/src/components/variables` directory contains React components designed to manage and display variable-related information within a user interface. The primary components in this directory are `common.tsx` and `variables-table.tsx`. 

- `common.tsx` defines a `VariableName` component that displays a variable's name in a styled badge and allows users to copy the name to the clipboard.
- `variables-table.tsx` defines a `VariableTable` component that renders a table of variables, showing details such as names, types, values, and the cells that declare and use them. It utilizes the `@tanstack/react-table` library for advanced table functionalities like sorting and filtering.

## What does it do?

The components in this directory are designed to enhance the user experience in applications where variables are a central element, such as in a notebook or code editor environment.

- **VariableName Component**: This component displays a variable's name in a visually distinct badge. When a user clicks on the badge, the variable's name is copied to the clipboard, and a toast notification informs the user of this action. This feature is useful for quickly sharing or reusing variable names without manually selecting and copying text.

- **VariableTable Component**: This component provides a comprehensive view of variables within a table format. It displays each variable's name, type, value, and the cells that declare and use them. Users can sort and filter the table to find specific variables or understand their usage across different parts of the application. This functionality is particularly beneficial in environments where variables are defined and manipulated across multiple cells or modules, allowing users to track and manage them efficiently.

## Entry points

The main files in this directory are `common.tsx` and `variables-table.tsx`. 

- **common.tsx**: This file is focused on the `VariableName` component, which is a smaller, utility component used to display and interact with individual variable names.

- **variables-table.tsx**: This file contains the `VariableTable` component, which is a more complex component responsible for rendering a table of variables with sorting and filtering capabilities. It is likely the primary entry point for developers looking to understand or modify how variables are displayed and managed in a tabular format.

## Key Files

- **common.tsx**: Contains the `VariableName` component, which is responsible for displaying variable names in a badge and providing clipboard copy functionality.

- **variables-table.tsx**: Contains the `VariableTable` component, which renders a table of variables with features like sorting and filtering, leveraging the `@tanstack/react-table` library for advanced table management.

## Dependencies

- **React**: Used for building the functional components in this directory.
- **@tanstack/react-table**: Provides advanced table functionalities such as sorting and filtering, used in the `VariableTable` component.
- **lodash-es**: Utilized for utility functions like `sortBy`, aiding in data manipulation within the `VariableTable` component.
- **lucide-react**: Supplies icons used in the `VariableTable`, enhancing the visual representation of the table.
- **Badge and toast**: Imported from custom UI modules, these are used in the `VariableName` component for displaying styled badges and showing toast notifications, respectively.
