## High-level description

The target file `common.tsx` defines a React functional component named `VariableName`. This component is designed to display a variable's name within a styled badge, and it provides functionality to copy the variable's name to the clipboard when clicked. The component also uses a toast notification to inform the user that the name has been copied.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in this file is the `VariableName` component. It utilizes the `Badge` component from the `ui/badge` module to display the variable name and the `toast` function from the `ui/use-toast` module to show a notification when the name is copied to the clipboard.

## Symbols

### `VariableName`
#### Description
The `VariableName` component is a React functional component that displays a variable's name in a badge. It allows users to copy the variable's name to the clipboard by clicking on it. If the `onClick` prop is provided, it will execute that function instead of the default clipboard copy action.

#### Inputs
| Name      | Type   | Description                           |
|:----------|:-------|:--------------------------------------|
| name      | string | The name of the variable to display.  |
| declaredBy| string[] | An array of identifiers indicating where the variable is declared. |
| onClick   | function | An optional click handler function. |
| ...rest   | object | Additional HTML attributes for the div element. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX  | JSX.Element | A JSX element representing the variable name badge. |

#### Internal Logic
- The component renders a `div` containing a `Badge` component.
- The `Badge` component's `variant` is determined by the length of the `declaredBy` array: if more than one, it uses the "destructive" variant; otherwise, it uses the "outline" variant.
- The `onClick` event of the `Badge` is handled to either execute the provided `onClick` function or perform the default action of copying the `name` to the clipboard and showing a toast notification.

## References

- **Badge**: Imported from `../ui/badge`, used to display the variable name with specific styling.
- **toast**: Imported from `../ui/use-toast`, used to show a notification when the variable name is copied to the clipboard.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React      | Used for creating the functional component. |
| Badge      | Provides a styled badge component for displaying the variable name. |
| toast      | Provides a mechanism to show toast notifications. |

## Side Effects

- The component interacts with the clipboard API to copy text.
- It triggers a toast notification to inform the user of the copy action.

## Performance Considerations

- The component uses the `navigator.clipboard` API, which is asynchronous and may have performance implications if used excessively in a high-frequency context.

## Error Handling

- The component does not explicitly handle errors from the clipboard API or the toast notification system. It assumes these operations succeed.

## Logging

- There is no logging implemented in this component.
