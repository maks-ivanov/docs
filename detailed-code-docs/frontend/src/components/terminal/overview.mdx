## High-level description

The directory contains components related to implementing a terminal interface within a web application using React and the `xterm.js` library. The main component, `TerminalComponent`, is responsible for rendering the terminal interface and managing its lifecycle, including establishing a WebSocket connection for real-time communication with a backend server. The directory also includes a CSS file, `xterm.css`, which provides styling for the terminal component to ensure a visually appealing and readable interface.

## What does it do?

The code in this directory allows users to interact with a terminal interface directly within a web application. When a user accesses the terminal component, it establishes a WebSocket connection to a backend server, enabling real-time communication. This setup allows users to execute commands and receive output as if they were using a traditional terminal. The terminal interface is rendered using the `xterm.js` library, which provides the necessary functionality to emulate a terminal environment. The component also handles resizing and visibility changes to ensure a seamless user experience.

## Entry points

The main entry point in this directory is the `terminal.tsx` file, which contains the `TerminalComponent`. This component is responsible for rendering the terminal interface and managing its lifecycle, including WebSocket connection establishment and terminal resizing. The `xterm.css` file is imported within `terminal.tsx` to apply the necessary styles to the terminal component.

## Key Files

- **terminal.tsx**: Contains the `TerminalComponent`, which is the core of the terminal interface. It manages the terminal's lifecycle, including initialization, WebSocket connection, and resizing.
- **xterm.css**: Provides styling for the terminal component, ensuring that the terminal content is not flush against the edges and is visually appealing.

## Dependencies

The directory relies on several external libraries and addons:

- **`@xterm/xterm`**: Provides the core terminal emulator functionality, allowing the creation and management of a terminal interface.
- **`@xterm/addon-attach`**: An addon for `xterm.js` that enables the terminal to attach to a WebSocket, facilitating real-time communication with a backend server.
- **`@xterm/addon-fit`**: An addon for `xterm.js` that ensures the terminal fits its container by adjusting its size dynamically.
- **`react`**: Used for building the `TerminalComponent` as a React functional component.
