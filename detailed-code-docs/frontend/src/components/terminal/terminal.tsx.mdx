## High-level description

The `TerminalComponent` in `terminal.tsx` is a React component that integrates a terminal emulator using the `xterm.js` library. It establishes a WebSocket connection to facilitate real-time communication with a backend server, allowing users to interact with a terminal interface within a web application. The component manages terminal visibility, resizing, and connection lifecycle, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Code Structure

- **TerminalComponent**: The main React component that renders the terminal interface.
- **createWsUrl**: A utility function to construct the WebSocket URL for terminal communication.

## References

- **Strings.withoutTrailingSlash**: A utility function from `strings.ts` used to format the WebSocket URL.
- **@xterm/xterm**: The terminal emulator library used to create and manage the terminal interface.
- **@xterm/addon-attach**: An addon for `xterm.js` to attach a terminal to a WebSocket.
- **@xterm/addon-fit**: An addon for `xterm.js` to fit the terminal to its container.

## Symbols

### `TerminalComponent`
#### Description
The `TerminalComponent` is a React functional component that renders a terminal interface using `xterm.js`. It manages the terminal's lifecycle, including initialization, WebSocket connection, and resizing.

#### Inputs
| Name    | Type     | Description                        |
|:--------|:---------|:-----------------------------------|
| visible | boolean  | Determines if the terminal is visible. |
| onClose | function | Callback function to handle terminal closure. |

#### Outputs
The component does not return any outputs but renders a terminal interface within a `div`.

#### Internal Logic
- **Initialization**: Uses `useState` to create a terminal instance and load the `FitAddon`.
- **WebSocket Connection**: Establishes a WebSocket connection using `createWsUrl` and attaches it to the terminal using `AttachAddon`.
- **Visibility Handling**: Adjusts terminal focus and fitting when the `visible` prop changes.
- **Mounting and Resizing**: Opens the terminal in a `div` and adjusts its size on window resize events.

### `createWsUrl`
#### Description
Constructs a WebSocket URL based on the current document's base URI, switching protocols as necessary (HTTP to WS, HTTPS to WSS).

#### Inputs
None directly, but it uses `document.baseURI` internally.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type   | Description                  |
|:-----|:-------|:-----------------------------|
| url  | string | The constructed WebSocket URL. |

#### Internal Logic
- Parses the base URI to determine the appropriate WebSocket protocol.
- Adjusts the URL path to append `/terminal/ws`.
- Returns the formatted WebSocket URL.

## Side Effects

- **WebSocket Connection**: Establishes a WebSocket connection that persists while the terminal is active.
- **Event Listeners**: Adds and removes event listeners for window resizing.

## Dependencies

| Dependency          | Purpose                                      |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| `@xterm/xterm`      | Provides the terminal emulator functionality.|
| `@xterm/addon-attach` | Attaches the terminal to a WebSocket.       |
| `@xterm/addon-fit`  | Fits the terminal to its container.          |
| `react`             | Used for building the component.             |

## Error Handling

- The component does not explicitly handle errors beyond basic WebSocket disconnection handling, which triggers the `onClose` callback.

## Logging

No explicit logging is implemented within this component.

## TODOs

No TODOs are present in the code.
