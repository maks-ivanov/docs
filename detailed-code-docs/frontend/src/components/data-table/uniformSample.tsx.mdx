## High-level description

The `uniformSample` function in the target file is designed to uniformly sample a specified number of items from an array. If the number of items to sample (`n`) is greater than or equal to the length of the array, it returns the entire array. Otherwise, it selects `n` items evenly distributed across the array.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in the code is the `uniformSample` function. This function is utilized in other parts of the codebase, such as in the `columns.tsx` file, where it is used to sample a subset of data for processing column information.

## Symbols

### `uniformSample`
#### Description
The `uniformSample` function is a generic utility that samples `n` items from an array of any type `T`. It ensures that the sampled items are evenly distributed across the array.

#### Inputs
| Name  | Type | Description                        |
|:------|:-----|:-----------------------------------|
| items | T[]  | The array of items to sample from. |
| n     | number | The number of items to sample.    |

#### Outputs
| Name   | Type | Description                          |
|:-------|:-----|:-------------------------------------|
| sample | T[]  | An array containing the sampled items.|

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check Array Length**: If the length of `items` is less than or equal to `n`, return the entire `items` array.
2. **Calculate Step**: Determine the step size by dividing the length of `items` by `n`.
3. **Sample Items**: Iterate from 0 to `n-1`, calculate the index using `Math.floor(i * step)`, and add the item at this index to the `sample` array.
4. **Add Last Item**: Ensure the last item of the original array is included in the sample by adding `items.at(-1)` to the `sample`.

## References

- The `uniformSample` function is referenced in the `columns.tsx` file, where it is used to sample a subset of rows for determining column information.

## Dependencies

There are no external dependencies in the `uniformSample.tsx` file.

## Error Handling

The function does not explicitly handle errors, as it assumes valid input types and values. It relies on TypeScript's type system to ensure that the inputs are of the correct type.

## Usage Example

In the `columns.tsx` file, the `uniformSample` function is used to sample 10 items from a dataset to efficiently determine column information without processing the entire dataset. This is particularly useful for large datasets where performance is a concern.

```typescript
// Example usage in columns.tsx
uniformSample(items, 10).forEach((item) =&gt; {
  // Process each sampled item
});
```

This usage highlights the function's role in optimizing data processing by reducing the number of items that need to be examined.
