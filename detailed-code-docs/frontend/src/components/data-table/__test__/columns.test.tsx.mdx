## High-level description
The target file contains test cases for two components: `uniformSample` and `UrlDetector`. The `uniformSample` function is tested to ensure it correctly samples elements from an array, while the `UrlDetector` component is tested to verify that it correctly renders URLs within a text as hyperlinks.

## Code Structure
The file uses the `vitest` testing framework to define and execute test cases. It imports the `uniformSample` function and the `UrlDetector` component from their respective modules. The `render` function from `@testing-library/react` is used to test the rendering of the `UrlDetector` component.

## References
- `uniformSample`: A function imported from `../uniformSample` that samples elements from an array.
- `UrlDetector`: A React component imported from `../url-detector` that detects URLs in a text and renders them as hyperlinks.
- `render`: A function from `@testing-library/react` used to render React components for testing.

## Symbols

### `test("uniformSample", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case verifies the functionality of the `uniformSample` function by checking if it correctly samples elements from an array based on the specified sample size.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| items | Array | An array of strings to sample from. |
| sampleSize | Number | The number of elements to sample from the array. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Array | An array containing the sampled elements. |

#### Internal Logic
- The test checks if `uniformSample` returns the expected sampled elements for different sample sizes using `toMatchInlineSnapshot`.
- It verifies that when the sample size exceeds the array length, the original array is returned.

### `test("UrlDetector renders URLs as hyperlinks", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This test case ensures that the `UrlDetector` component correctly identifies and renders URLs within a given text as hyperlinks.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| text | String | A string containing a URL to be detected and rendered as a hyperlink. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| link | HTMLElement | The hyperlink element rendered by the `UrlDetector`. |

#### Internal Logic
- The test uses `render` to render the `UrlDetector` component with a sample text containing a URL.
- It checks if an anchor (`&lt;a&gt;`) element is present in the rendered output and verifies its `href` attribute to ensure it matches the expected URL.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `vitest` | Provides the testing framework for defining and running test cases. |
| `@testing-library/react` | Used to render React components and query the DOM for testing purposes. |

## Error Handling
The test cases rely on assertions provided by `vitest` to handle errors. If an assertion fails, the test will report an error, indicating that the expected behavior was not met.

## Logging
No explicit logging is implemented in the test cases. The `vitest` framework handles test output and reporting.

## TODOs
No TODOs or notes are present in the code.
