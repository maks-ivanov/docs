## High-level description

The directory `frontend/src/components/data-table/__test__` contains unit tests for specific functionalities related to data formatting and component behavior within a data table context. The primary focus is on ensuring that data values are formatted correctly and that components behave as expected when rendering or processing data. The main components or modules tested in this directory include the `applyFormat` function, which formats data values, and the `UrlDetector` component, which identifies and renders URLs as hyperlinks. Additionally, the `uniformSample` function is tested to verify its ability to sample elements from an array.

## What does it do?

The tests in this directory serve to validate the correctness and reliability of specific functionalities within the data table component. Here's a breakdown of the workflows and processes:

1. **Data Formatting with `applyFormat`:** 
   - The `applyFormat` function is tested to ensure it can format various data types, such as dates, numbers, strings, and booleans, according to specified format options. For instance, it checks if dates are formatted correctly based on locale settings or if numbers are displayed in scientific notation when required.

2. **Component Rendering with `UrlDetector`:**
   - The `UrlDetector` component is tested to confirm that it can detect URLs within a text string and render them as clickable hyperlinks. This ensures that any text containing URLs is appropriately processed and displayed to users.

3. **Array Sampling with `uniformSample`:**
   - The `uniformSample` function is tested to verify that it can correctly sample a specified number of elements from an array. This is useful for scenarios where a subset of data needs to be displayed or processed.

These tests help ensure that the data table component behaves as expected, providing accurate data representation and user interaction capabilities.

## Entry points

The directory contains multiple test files, each focusing on different aspects of the data table component:

- **`column_formatting.test.ts`:** This file is the entry point for testing the `applyFormat` function. It organizes tests into blocks that focus on different data types and scenarios, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the formatting logic.

- **`columns.test.tsx`:** This file serves as the entry point for testing the `uniformSample` function and the `UrlDetector` component. It uses the `vitest` framework to define test cases and the `@testing-library/react` to render components for testing.

## Dependencies

The tests in this directory rely on several external libraries:

- **`vitest`:** This is the primary testing framework used to define and execute unit tests. It provides a robust environment for writing and running tests, with features like assertions and test reporting.

- **`@testing-library/react`:** This library is used to render React components and query the DOM during testing. It facilitates testing of component behavior and output, ensuring that components render correctly and interact with the DOM as expected.

- **`@/utils/numbers`:** This module provides utility functions for number formatting, such as `prettyScientificNumber`, which are used within the `applyFormat` function to handle specific number formatting scenarios.
