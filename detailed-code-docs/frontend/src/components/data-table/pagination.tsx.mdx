## High-level description

The `pagination.tsx` file defines a React component, `DataTablePagination`, which provides pagination controls for a data table. It allows users to navigate through pages of data, select all rows, clear selections, and view the total number of rows and selected rows. The component leverages the `@tanstack/react-table` library for table management and uses UI components like buttons for interaction.

## Code Structure

- **DataTablePagination**: The main component that renders pagination controls.
- **prettyNumber**: A utility function to format numbers for display.

## Symbols

### `DataTablePagination`
#### Description
The `DataTablePagination` component provides a user interface for paginating through a data table. It includes controls for navigating to the first, previous, next, and last pages, as well as a dropdown for selecting a specific page. It also displays the total number of rows and the number of selected rows, with options to select all or clear selections.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| table | `Table&lt;TData&gt;` | An instance of a table from `@tanstack/react-table` that manages the data and state for the table. |

#### Outputs
This component does not return any outputs but renders UI elements for pagination.

#### Internal Logic
- **Render Total**: Displays the number of selected rows and provides buttons to select all or clear selections based on the current selection state.
- **Pagination Controls**: 
  - **First Page Button**: Navigates to the first page if not already there.
  - **Previous Page Button**: Navigates to the previous page if possible.
  - **Page Selector**: A dropdown to select a specific page.
  - **Next Page Button**: Navigates to the next page if possible.
  - **Last Page Button**: Navigates to the last page if not already there.

### `prettyNumber`
#### Description
Formats a number into a more readable string using the `Intl.NumberFormat` API.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| value | `number` | The number to be formatted. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| formattedNumber | `string` | The formatted number as a string. |

## References

- **Button**: Imported from `@/components/ui/button`, used for rendering interactive buttons in the pagination controls.
- **PluralWord**: Imported from `@/utils/pluralize`, used to handle pluralization of the word "row" based on the number of rows.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@tanstack/react-table` | Provides the table instance and state management for pagination. |
| `lucide-react` | Provides icon components for pagination buttons. |

## Error Handling

The component does not explicitly handle errors but relies on the `@tanstack/react-table` library to manage table state and interactions. Any errors related to table operations would need to be handled at a higher level or within the table library itself.

## Logging

There is no explicit logging implemented in this component.

## Performance Considerations

The component efficiently updates the UI based on the table's state, minimizing unnecessary re-renders by directly interacting with the table instance provided by `@tanstack/react-table`. The use of `Intl.NumberFormat` for number formatting is also efficient for rendering large numbers.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
