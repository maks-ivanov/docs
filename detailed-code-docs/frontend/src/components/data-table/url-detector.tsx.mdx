## High-level description

The `UrlDetector` component in the target file is a React functional component designed to detect URLs within a given text and convert them into clickable hyperlinks. It uses a regular expression to identify URLs and wraps them in anchor (`&lt;a&gt;`) tags, ensuring that the links open in a new tab and do not propagate click events.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in the code is the `UrlDetector` component. It utilizes a regular expression to parse the input text and identify URLs. The component then maps over the text parts, converting detected URLs into clickable links. The `Events.stopPropagation` function from the `events` utility is used to prevent event propagation when a link is clicked.

## Symbols

### `UrlDetector`
#### Description
The `UrlDetector` component is responsible for parsing a string of text to identify URLs and render them as clickable hyperlinks. It ensures that the links open in a new tab and prevents the click event from propagating further.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| text | string | The input text that may contain URLs to be detected and converted into hyperlinks. |

#### Outputs
The component returns a React fragment containing the processed text, where URLs are converted into clickable links.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Regular Expression**: A regular expression `urlRegex` is defined to match URLs in the text.
2. **Text Splitting**: The input text is split into parts using the `urlRegex`.
3. **Mapping Parts**: Each part of the split text is mapped over:
   - If a part matches the URL pattern, it is wrapped in an `&lt;a&gt;` tag with attributes to open in a new tab and prevent event propagation.
   - Non-URL parts are returned as plain text.
4. **Rendering**: The processed parts are returned as a React fragment.

## Side Effects
- The component uses the `Events.stopPropagation` function to prevent click events on the links from propagating, which might affect parent components or event handlers.

## References

- **`Events.stopPropagation`**: This utility function is imported from `frontend/src/utils/events.ts` and is used to prevent event propagation when a link is clicked.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `Events` from `@/utils/events` | Provides utility functions for handling events, specifically used here to stop event propagation. |

## Error Handling
The component does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the input text is a valid string and that the regular expression will correctly identify URLs.

## Logging
There is no logging implemented in this component.

## API/Interface Reference
The `UrlDetector` component does not expose an API or interface beyond its input prop.
