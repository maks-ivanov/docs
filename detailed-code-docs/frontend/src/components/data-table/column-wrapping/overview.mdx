## High-level description

The `column-wrapping` subdirectory within the data table component of a frontend application is designed to manage the text wrapping behavior of table columns. It extends the functionality of the `@tanstack/react-table` library by providing additional features and types that allow developers to dynamically control whether text in a table column should wrap or not. The subdirectory consists of two main files: `feature.ts` and `types.ts`. The `feature.ts` file implements the logic for managing column wrapping, while the `types.ts` file defines the necessary TypeScript types and interfaces to support this functionality.

## What does it do?

The `column-wrapping` feature allows users to control how text is displayed within table columns. Specifically, it provides the ability to toggle between "wrap" and "nowrap" states for each column. This means that users can decide whether the text in a column should be displayed on a single line (nowrap) or should wrap onto multiple lines (wrap) if it exceeds the column width. This feature is particularly useful for improving the readability of data tables, especially when dealing with long text entries.

The feature integrates with the `@tanstack/react-table` library, which is a popular library for building flexible and customizable data tables in React applications. By extending this library, the `column-wrapping` feature can seamlessly manage the wrapping state of columns as part of the table's overall state management system.

## Entry points

The main files in the `column-wrapping` subdirectory are:

- **`feature.ts`**: This file is the core of the column wrapping functionality. It defines the `ColumnWrappingFeature` object, which includes methods for initializing the wrapping state, setting default options, and extending column objects with wrapping-related methods. It interacts with the table's state and options to manage the wrapping behavior of columns.

- **`types.ts`**: This file defines the TypeScript types and interfaces necessary for managing column wrapping. It includes types for the wrapping state, table state, options, and column instance methods. These types are used to extend the existing types from the `@tanstack/react-table` library, enabling additional functionality for managing column wrapping states.

## Key Files

- **`feature.ts`**: Implements the logic for managing column wrapping. It defines the `ColumnWrappingFeature` object, which provides methods to initialize the wrapping state, set default options, and extend column objects with wrapping-related methods. This file is crucial for integrating the column wrapping functionality with the `@tanstack/react-table` library.

- **`types.ts`**: Defines the TypeScript types and interfaces that support the column wrapping functionality. It includes types for the wrapping state, table state, options, and column instance methods. These types are essential for ensuring type safety and consistency when managing column wrapping states.

## Dependencies

The `column-wrapping` feature relies on the `@tanstack/react-table` library, which provides the base table and column structures and utilities for managing state and options. This library is chosen for its flexibility and extensibility, allowing developers to build highly customizable data tables in React applications. The feature extends this library to include additional functionality for managing column wrapping states.
