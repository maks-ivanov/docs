## High-level description

The `ColumnWrappingFeature` module is a part of a data table component that provides functionality for managing column text wrapping in a table. It defines the initial state, default options, and methods for columns to toggle and check the wrapping state, allowing for dynamic control over whether text in a column should wrap or not.

## Code Structure

The `ColumnWrappingFeature` is a `TableFeature` object that integrates with the `@tanstack/react-table` library. It consists of methods to initialize state, set default options, and extend column functionality with wrapping-related methods. The feature interacts with the table's state and options to manage column wrapping behavior.

## Symbols

### `ColumnWrappingFeature`
#### Description
The `ColumnWrappingFeature` is an object that defines a set of functionalities related to column text wrapping in a table. It provides methods to initialize the wrapping state, set default options, and extend column objects with wrapping-related methods.

#### Inputs
- `state`: An object representing the current state of the table.
- `table`: A `Table` object from `@tanstack/react-table`.
- `column`: A `Column` object from `@tanstack/react-table`.

#### Outputs
- Returns an object with methods and properties to manage column wrapping.

#### Internal Logic
- **`getInitialState`**: Initializes the table state with a `columnWrapping` property, which is an empty object by default.
- **`getDefaultOptions`**: Sets default options for column wrapping, enabling it by default and providing a state updater function for changes.
- **`createColumn`**: Extends a column with methods to get the current wrapping state, check if wrapping is allowed, and toggle the wrapping state. The `toggleColumnWrapping` method uses a safe updater to change the wrapping state based on the current value or a provided value.

## References

- **`@tanstack/react-table`**: The feature relies on this library for table and column management, using its types and utility functions like `makeStateUpdater`.
- **`ColumnWrappingTableState`, `ColumnWrappingOptions`, `ColumnWrappingState`**: These types are imported from the `types.ts` file and define the structure of the wrapping state and options.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |

| `@tanstack/react-table` | Provides the table and column structures and utilities for managing state and options. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors but relies on TypeScript's type system to ensure correct usage of types and methods.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in this code.

## API/Interface Reference

The `ColumnWrappingFeature` does not expose an API directly but integrates with the `@tanstack/react-table` library to extend its functionality.

## TODOs
