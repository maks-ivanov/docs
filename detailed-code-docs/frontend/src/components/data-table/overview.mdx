## What does it do?

The data table module provides a robust framework for displaying and interacting with tabular data in a web application. Here's a breakdown of its core functionalities:

1. **Data Formatting and Rendering**: 
   - The module includes utilities for formatting data values based on their types, such as numbers, dates, and strings. This ensures that data is presented in a user-friendly manner.

4. **Pagination and Filtering**:
   - The `pagination.tsx` file provides a component for navigating through pages of data, with controls for selecting rows and viewing totals.
   - The `filters.ts` file defines filter types and logic for applying filters to data columns, while the `filter-pills.tsx` component displays active filters as visual pills.

5. **Download and Export**:
   - The `download-actions.tsx` file includes a component for downloading table data in CSV or JSON formats, using a dropdown menu to select the desired format.

6. **Testing**:
   - The `__test__` subdirectory contains unit tests to validate the functionality of data formatting, URL detection, and array sampling, ensuring the reliability of the data table components.

Overall, the data table module is designed to provide a seamless and interactive experience for users working with tabular data, offering a range of customization options and features to suit various application needs.
