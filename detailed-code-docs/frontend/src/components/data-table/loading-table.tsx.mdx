## High-level description

The `loading-table.tsx` file defines a React component named `LoadingTable` that renders a placeholder table with animated loading indicators. This component is used to display a loading state for a data table, providing a visual cue to users that data is being fetched or processed.

## Code Structure

The `LoadingTable` component utilizes several UI components from a table module, such as `Table`, `TableBody`, `TableCell`, `TableHead`, `TableHeader`, and `TableRow`. It also uses a utility function `cn` for class name management. The component is designed to be flexible, allowing customization of class names and the number of rows to display during the loading state.

## Symbols

### `LoadingTable`
#### Description
The `LoadingTable` component is a React functional component that renders a table structure with animated placeholders to indicate loading. It is primarily used to show a loading state for a data table, with customizable styling and row count.

#### Inputs
| Name              | Type   | Description                                      |
|:------------------|:-------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| wrapperClassName  | string | Optional class name for the wrapper div.         |
| className         | string | Optional class name for the table container.     |
| pageSize          | number | Number of rows to display in the loading state.  |

#### Outputs
The component does not return any outputs in the traditional sense, as it is a React component that renders JSX.

#### Internal Logic
- The component defines a constant `NUM_COLUMNS` set to 8, representing the number of columns in the table.
- It returns a JSX structure that includes a wrapper `div` with a flexible layout.
- Inside the wrapper, a `Table` component is rendered with a `TableHeader` and `TableBody`.
- The `TableHeader` contains a single `TableRow` with `NUM_COLUMNS` `TableHead` cells, each containing a `div` with a loading animation.
- The `TableBody` contains `pageSize` number of `TableRow` elements, each with `NUM_COLUMNS` `TableCell` elements, also containing animated `div`s.
- The `cn` utility function is used to merge and apply class names for styling.

## References

- The `LoadingTable` component references several table-related components (`Table`, `TableBody`, `TableCell`, `TableHead`, `TableHeader`, `TableRow`) from the `table.tsx` file.
- It uses the `cn` function from the `cn.ts` utility file to manage class names.
