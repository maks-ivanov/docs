## High-level description

The `column-formatting` subdirectory within the `frontend/src/components/data-table` directory is designed to enhance the functionality of data tables by providing column formatting capabilities. It leverages the TanStack Table library to allow developers to apply various formatting options to table columns based on their data types, such as date, number, string, and boolean. The subdirectory consists of two main files: `feature.ts` and `types.ts`. The `feature.ts` file implements the logic for applying these formatting options, while `types.ts` defines the TypeScript types and interfaces necessary for managing the formatting options and integrating them with the TanStack Table library.

## What does it do?

The `column-formatting` feature allows users to customize how data is displayed in a table by applying specific formatting rules to each column. For example, a column containing numerical data can be formatted to display numbers with commas as thousand separators or in scientific notation. Similarly, date columns can be formatted to display dates in different formats, such as "MM/DD/YYYY" or "DD-MM-YYYY". This feature is particularly useful for making data more readable and ensuring consistency in how information is presented across different parts of an application.

The process begins with defining the available formatting options for each data type in `types.ts`. These options are then used in `feature.ts` to apply the desired formatting to the table columns. The `ColumnFormattingFeature` object in `feature.ts` integrates with the TanStack Table library to manage the state and options related to column formatting. It provides methods for initializing the formatting state, setting default options, and applying the formatting to column values. Utility functions are used to handle specific formatting tasks, such as formatting numbers and dates according to locale-specific rules.

## Entry points

The main files in the `column-formatting` subdirectory are `feature.ts` and `types.ts`. 

- `feature.ts`: This file is the core of the column formatting functionality. It defines the `ColumnFormattingFeature` object, which is responsible for managing the column formatting state and applying the formatting options to the table columns. It also includes utility functions for formatting values based on their data types.

- `types.ts`: This file defines the TypeScript types and interfaces necessary for managing column formatting options. It specifies the available formatting options for different data types and extends the TanStack Table library's types to include custom column formatting state, options, and instance methods.

## Key Files

- **`feature.ts`**: Implements the logic for applying column formatting options. It defines the `ColumnFormattingFeature` object, which integrates with the TanStack Table library to manage column formatting. It also includes utility functions for formatting values based on their data types.

- **`types.ts`**: Defines the TypeScript types and interfaces necessary for managing column formatting options. It specifies the available formatting options for different data types and extends the TanStack Table library's types to include custom column formatting state, options, and instance methods.

## Dependencies

- **`@tanstack/react-table`**: This library is used for table management, providing types and utilities for integrating the column formatting feature with the table's state and options.

- **`@/utils/numbers`**: Provides utility functions for formatting numbers, such as adding commas as thousand separators or converting numbers to scientific notation.

- **`@/utils/assertNever`**: Provides a utility function for handling unexpected cases in switch statements, ensuring that all possible data types are accounted for when applying formatting options.
