## High-level description

The target file `types.ts` defines TypeScript types and interfaces used in a data table component within a frontend application. It provides a structure for summarizing column headers and defines types for field data, including external types. These types are used to ensure type safety and consistency across the data table component, particularly in handling column data and field types.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are `ColumnHeaderSummary`, `FieldTypesWithExternalType`, and `FieldTypes`. These symbols are used to define the structure and types of data that the data table component will handle. The `ColumnHeaderSummary` interface is used to summarize information about a column, while `FieldTypesWithExternalType` and `FieldTypes` are used to map field names to their respective data types.

## Symbols

### `ColumnHeaderSummary`
#### Description
The `ColumnHeaderSummary` interface defines the structure for summarizing a column's data in a data table. It includes properties for the column name, minimum and maximum values, count of unique values, and counts of null, true, and false values.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| column | string \| number | The name or index of the column. |
| min | number \| string \| undefined \| null | The minimum value in the column. |
| max | number \| string \| undefined \| null | The maximum value in the column. |
| unique | number \| null | The count of unique values in the column. |
| nulls | number \| null | The count of null values in the column. |
| true | number \| null | The count of true values in the column. |
| false | number \| null | The count of false values in the column. |

#### Outputs
This is a TypeScript interface and does not produce outputs directly.

### `FieldTypesWithExternalType`
#### Description
`FieldTypesWithExternalType` is a type alias for a record that maps field names to a tuple containing a `DataType` and an external type string. This is used to associate each field with its data type and an additional external type descriptor.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | The field name. |
| value | [DataType, string] | A tuple containing the data type and an external type string. |

#### Outputs
This is a TypeScript type alias and does not produce outputs directly.

### `FieldTypes`
#### Description
`FieldTypes` is a type alias for a record that maps field names to their `DataType`. It is used to define the data type for each field in the data table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | The field name. |
| value | DataType | The data type of the field. |

#### Outputs
This is a TypeScript type alias and does not produce outputs directly.

## References

- `DataType` from `@/core/kernel/messages`: This type is used in both `FieldTypesWithExternalType` and `FieldTypes` to specify the data type of fields.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@/core/kernel/messages` | Provides the `DataType` type used in defining field types. |

## Error Handling

The target file does not implement any error handling as it primarily defines types and interfaces.

## Logging

The target file does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The target file does not define an API or public interface directly. It provides type definitions used by other components in the application.
