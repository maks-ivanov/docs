## High-level description

The `toolbar.tsx` file defines a React functional component named `Toolbar` that provides a flexible layout for a toolbar with three sections: left, center, and right. This component is designed to handle dynamic content by allowing items to be added or removed from each section without disrupting the overall layout.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in this file is the `Toolbar` component, which is a React functional component. It uses the `Props` interface to define the expected properties for the component, which include optional React nodes for the left, center, and right sections of the toolbar.

## Symbols

### `Toolbar`
#### Description
The `Toolbar` component is a layout component that organizes its children into three sections: left, center, and right. It is designed to be more flexible than a simple `justify-between` layout by allowing dynamic addition and removal of items in each section without affecting the overall alignment.

#### Inputs
| Name   | Type            | Description                                      |
|:-------|:----------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| left   | React.ReactNode | Optional content to be displayed on the left.    |
| center | React.ReactNode | Optional content to be displayed in the center.  |
| right  | React.ReactNode | Optional content to be displayed on the right.   |

#### Outputs
The `Toolbar` component does not produce any direct outputs. It renders a JSX element that represents the toolbar layout.

#### Internal Logic
The `Toolbar` component uses a `div` with a `flex` layout to distribute its children across three sections. Each section is given equal flex space (`flex-1`) to ensure they are evenly distributed across the available width. The `gap-2` class is used to add spacing between items within each section, and `justify-center` and `justify-end` are used to align the center and right sections, respectively.

## References

The `Toolbar` component is imported and used in the `collapse.tsx` file, where it is utilized to create a toolbar layout for the `CollapsedCellBanner` component. This demonstrates the `Toolbar` component's role in providing a consistent layout structure across different parts of the application.

## Dependencies

The `Toolbar` component relies on the React library for creating the component and handling its properties.

| Dependency | Purpose                  |
|:-----------|:-------------------------|
| React      | To create the functional component and manage its properties. |

## Error Handling

The `Toolbar` component does not implement any specific error handling mechanisms, as it primarily deals with rendering layout and does not perform operations that typically require error handling.

## Logging

There are no logging mechanisms implemented in the `Toolbar` component.

## API/Interface Reference

The `Toolbar` component does not expose an API or public interface beyond its React component interface, which is defined by the `Props` interface.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
