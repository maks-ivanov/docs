## High-level description

The `large-spinner.tsx` file defines a React functional component named `LargeSpinner`. This component is used to display a loading spinner with a message indicating that an initialization process is underway. It utilizes the `Loader2Icon` from the `lucide-react` library to visually represent the loading state.

## Code Structure

The `LargeSpinner` component is a standalone functional component that imports and uses the `Loader2Icon` from the `lucide-react` library. It is designed to be used in other parts of the application where a loading indicator is needed, such as in the `PyodideLoader` component from the related code snippet.

## Symbols

- Inside the `div`, it renders the `Loader2Icon` with additional classes to set its size, animation, and color.
- Below the icon, it renders another `div` containing the text "Initializing..." with styling for font size and color.
