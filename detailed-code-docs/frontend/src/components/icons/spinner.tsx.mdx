## High-level description

The `spinner.tsx` file defines a React component named `Spinner` that renders a spinning loader icon. This component is customizable in terms of size and positioning, using a utility for class variance. It leverages the `Loader2Icon` from the `lucide-react` library to visually represent the spinner.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are interconnected as follows:
- `spinnerVariants`: A utility function from `class-variance-authority` that defines the styling variants for the spinner.
- `Spinner`: A React component that uses `spinnerVariants` to apply styles and renders the `Loader2Icon`.

## Symbols

### `spinnerVariants`
#### Description
`spinnerVariants` is a utility function that defines the CSS class variants for the spinner component. It allows the spinner to be styled based on its size and whether it is centered.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | This is a configuration object, not a function with inputs. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | object | An object containing CSS class names based on the provided variant options. |

#### Internal Logic
- The function uses `cva` from `class-variance-authority` to define variants for `centered` and `size`.
- The `centered` variant applies a `m-auto` class when true.
- The `size` variant can be `small`, `medium`, `large`, or `xlarge`, each corresponding to a different size class.
- The default size is set to `medium`.

### `Spinner`
#### Description
The `Spinner` component is a React component that renders a spinning loader icon. It uses the `Loader2Icon` from `lucide-react` and applies styles based on the `spinnerVariants` configuration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| className | string | Additional CSS classes to apply to the spinner. |
| children | ReactNode | Children elements, though not used in this component. |
| centered | boolean | Determines if the spinner should be centered. |
| size | string | Specifies the size of the spinner. |
| props | object | Additional properties passed to the SVG element. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Spinner | ReactElement | A React element representing the spinner icon. |

#### Internal Logic
- The component uses `React.forwardRef` to forward a ref to the `Loader2Icon`.
- It combines the class names from `spinnerVariants` and any additional `className` provided.
- The `Loader2Icon` is rendered with a `strokeWidth` of 1.5 and any additional props passed to the `Spinner`.

## References

- The `Spinner` component is used in various parts of the application, as seen in the related files, to indicate loading states.
- The `cn` utility function from `@/utils/cn` is used to merge class names.
- The `Loader2Icon` from `lucide-react` is used as the visual representation of the spinner.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `class-variance-authority` | Used to define and manage CSS class variants. |
| `lucide-react` | Provides the `Loader2Icon` used for the spinner. |
| `React` | The base library for building the component. |

## Side Effects

- The `Spinner` component does not have any side effects. It is a pure visual component that does not modify global state or interact with external resources.

## Performance Considerations

- The `Spinner` component is lightweight and primarily involves rendering an SVG icon with CSS animations. It should not have significant performance implications.

## Logging

- There is no logging implemented in this component.

## TODOs

- There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
