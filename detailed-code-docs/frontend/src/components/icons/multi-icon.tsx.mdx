## High-level description

The `multi-icon.tsx` file defines a React component named `MultiIcon` that is used to layer two icons on top of each other within a container. The component allows for flexible positioning of the second icon, either at the bottom right or top left of the first icon, based on a prop.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in this file is the `MultiIcon` component. It utilizes the `PropsWithChildren` type from React to accept children elements, which are expected to be two icons. The component uses CSS classes to position the second icon relative to the first.

## Symbols

### `MultiIcon`
#### Description
The `MultiIcon` component is designed to display two icons in a layered fashion. By default, the first icon remains in its original position, while the second icon is positioned either at the bottom right or top left of the first icon, depending on the `layerTop` prop.

#### Inputs
| Name     | Type                  | Description                                                                 |
|:---------|:----------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| children | `React.ReactNode[]`   | An array of React nodes, expected to contain two icons to be layered.       |
| layerTop | `boolean` (optional)  | A boolean flag that determines the positioning of the second icon. Defaults to `false`. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX  | `JSX.Element` | A JSX element that renders the two icons in a layered configuration. |

#### Internal Logic
- The component destructures the `children` prop to extract the first and second icons.
- It determines the CSS positioning class for the second icon based on the `layerTop` prop.
- It returns a `div` containing the first icon and another `div` for the second icon, which is absolutely positioned using the calculated CSS class.
