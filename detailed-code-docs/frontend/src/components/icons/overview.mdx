## High-level description

This directory contains React components and associated styles for various icons used in a frontend application. The components are designed to provide visual feedback and enhance user interaction through icons like copy buttons, spinners, and layered icons. The directory includes both TypeScript and CSS files, each serving specific roles in the UI.

## What does it do?

The components in this directory serve different purposes:

1. **CopyClipboardIcon**: This component provides a user interface element for copying text to the clipboard. It visually indicates the copy action using icons and can display a tooltip to guide the user. When a user clicks the icon, the specified text is copied to the clipboard, and the icon changes to indicate success.

2. **LargeSpinner**: This component displays a loading spinner with a message indicating that an initialization process is underway. It is used to inform users that a process is in progress, such as loading data or initializing an environment.

3. **MultiIcon**: This component allows for layering two icons on top of each other within a container. It provides flexibility in positioning the second icon, either at the bottom right or top left of the first icon, based on a prop. This is useful for creating composite icons that convey more complex states or actions.

4. **Spinner**: This component renders a customizable spinning loader icon. It can be adjusted in terms of size and positioning, making it suitable for various loading states across the application.

5. **multi-icon.css**: This CSS file styles elements with the class `multi-icon` and its child elements with the class `second-icon`. It defines background styles and changes the background when a parent element with the class `menu-item` is hovered over, enhancing the visual interaction.

## Entry points

The main files in this directory are:

- **copy-icon.tsx**: Defines the `CopyClipboardIcon` component, which is used for clipboard interactions.
- **large-spinner.tsx**: Contains the `LargeSpinner` component for displaying loading states.
- **multi-icon.tsx**: Implements the `MultiIcon` component for layered icon displays.
- **spinner.tsx**: Provides the `Spinner` component for general loading indicators.

These files are organized to provide specific functionalities, with each component focusing on a particular type of icon or visual feedback.

## Key Files

- **multi-icon.css**: This file provides the styling necessary for the `MultiIcon` component, ensuring that the icons are positioned and styled correctly based on user interactions.

## Dependencies

The components rely on several external libraries:

- **lucide-react**: Provides icons like `CheckIcon`, `Copy`, and `Loader2Icon`, which are used across the components for visual representation.
- **react**: The base library for building the components, providing essential hooks like `useState`.
- **class-variance-authority**: Used in the `Spinner` component to manage CSS class variants, allowing for flexible styling based on component props.

These dependencies are chosen for their ability to provide robust and flexible iconography and styling capabilities, essential for creating a dynamic and responsive user interface.
