## High-level description
The CSS file `multi-icon.css` is used to style elements with the class `multi-icon` and its child elements with the class `second-icon`. It defines background styles for these elements and changes the background when a parent element with the class `menu-item` is hovered over.

## Code Structure
The CSS file contains two main style rules that apply to elements with specific class names. The first rule applies a background style to `.second-icon` elements within `.multi-icon` elements. The second rule changes the background style of `.second-icon` elements when their parent `.menu-item` is hovered over.

## Side Effects
- The background style of `.second-icon` elements changes when the parent `.menu-item` is hovered over, which can affect the visual appearance and user interaction.

## Performance Considerations
- The use of `@apply` suggests reliance on a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS, which can optimize styling by reducing the need for custom CSS and improving maintainability.

## Error Handling
- There is no explicit error handling in CSS, but incorrect class names or missing utility classes could result in styles not being applied as expected.

## Logging
- CSS does not include logging mechanisms, so there is no logging in this file.

## TODOs
- There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
