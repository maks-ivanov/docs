## High-level description

The `ErrorBoundary.tsx` file defines a React component that acts as an error boundary using the `react-error-boundary` library. It provides a fallback UI to display when a child component throws an error, allowing the application to gracefully handle errors without crashing the entire component tree. The fallback UI includes an error message and a button to reset the error boundary, encouraging users to report issues on GitHub.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `ErrorBoundary` component and the `FallbackComponent`. The `ErrorBoundary` component wraps its children with a `ReactErrorBoundary` from the `react-error-boundary` library, specifying the `FallbackComponent` to render in case of an error. The `FallbackComponent` is responsible for displaying the error message and providing a button to reset the error boundary.

## Symbols

### `ErrorBoundary`
#### Description
The `ErrorBoundary` component is a React functional component that wraps its children with a `ReactErrorBoundary`. It is used to catch JavaScript errors anywhere in its child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the component tree.

#### Inputs
| Name   | Type             | Description                  |
|:-------|:-----------------|:-----------------------------|
| props  | `PropsWithChildren` | The children components to be wrapped by the error boundary. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| -    | -    | This component does not return a value but renders its children or a fallback UI. |

### `FallbackComponent`
#### Description
The `FallbackComponent` is a React functional component that serves as the fallback UI when an error is caught by the `ErrorBoundary`. It displays an error message and provides a button to reset the error boundary, allowing users to retry the operation that caused the error.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type          | Description                  |
|:-----|:--------------|:-----------------------------|
| props | `FallbackProps` | Contains the error information and a function to reset the error boundary. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| -    | -    | This component does not return a value but renders the fallback UI. |

#### Internal Logic
The `FallbackComponent` uses the `props.error?.message` to display the error message. It also includes a link to report issues on GitHub using the URL from `Constants.issuesPage`. The `Button` component is used to trigger the `props.resetErrorBoundary` function, which resets the error boundary state.

## References

- `Constants.issuesPage`: A constant that provides the URL for reporting issues on GitHub.
- `Button`: A UI component used to render the "Try again" button in the fallback UI.

## Dependencies

| Dependency            | Purpose                                                                 |
|:----------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `react-error-boundary`| Provides the `ErrorBoundary` and `FallbackProps` types for error handling. |
| `../../ui/button`     | Provides the `Button` component used in the fallback UI.                |
| `@/core/constants`    | Provides the `Constants` object for accessing the GitHub issues page URL. |

## Error Handling

The `ErrorBoundary` component uses the `react-error-boundary` library to catch errors in its child component tree. When an error is caught, the `FallbackComponent` is rendered, displaying the error message and providing a way to reset the error boundary.

## Logging

There is no explicit logging mechanism implemented in this code. However, the `react-error-boundary` library can be configured to log errors to an external service if needed.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
