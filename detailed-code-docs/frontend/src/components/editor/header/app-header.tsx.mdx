## High-level description

The `AppHeader` component in the target file `app-header.tsx` is a React functional component designed to render a header section for an application. It displays its children and conditionally renders a `Disconnected` component if the WebSocket connection state is closed, indicating a disconnection with a specific reason.

## Code Structure

The `AppHeader` component is the main symbol in this file. It utilizes the `ConnectionStatus` type and `WebSocketState` enum from the `websocket/types` module to determine the connection state. It also uses the `Disconnected` component from another module to display a message when the connection is closed.

## Symbols

### `AppHeader`
#### Description
The `AppHeader` component is responsible for rendering a header section in the application. It accepts a connection status and a class name as props, along with any children elements. If the WebSocket connection is closed, it displays a `Disconnected` component with the reason for the disconnection.

#### Inputs
| Name       | Type                      | Description                                      |
|:-----------|:--------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| `className`| `string` (optional)       | CSS class name for styling the header.           |
| `connection` | `ConnectionStatus`      | The current status of the WebSocket connection.  |
| `children` | `React.ReactNode`         | Child elements to be rendered within the header. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `JSX.Element` | `JSX.Element` | A React element representing the header. |

#### Internal Logic
- The component returns a `div` element with the provided `className`.
- It renders any `children` passed to it.
- It checks if the `connection.state` is `WebSocketState.CLOSED`. If true, it renders the `Disconnected` component, passing the `reason` from the `connection` object.

## References

- **`ConnectionStatus`**: A type imported from `websocket/types` that describes the state of the WebSocket connection.
- **`WebSocketState`**: An enum imported from `websocket/types` that defines possible states of a WebSocket connection.
- **`Disconnected`**: A component imported from `Disconnected.tsx` that displays a message when the connection is closed.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `React`    | Used for creating the `AppHeader` component as a React functional component. |
| `ConnectionStatus`, `WebSocketState` | Used to determine the connection state and handle disconnection scenarios. |
| `Disconnected` | Used to display a message when the WebSocket connection is closed. |

## Error Handling

The component does not implement specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on the `connection` prop to determine the state and reason for disconnection.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in this component.

## API/Interface Reference

The `AppHeader` component does not expose an API or public interface beyond its props.
