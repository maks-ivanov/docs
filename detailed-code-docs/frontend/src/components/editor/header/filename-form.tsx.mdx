## High-level description

The `filename-form.tsx` file defines a React component named `FilenameForm` that is responsible for rendering a filename input field within an editor's header. This component utilizes the `FilenameInput` component to allow users to input or change the filename of a document, providing a placeholder and handling changes to the filename state.

## Code Structure

The `FilenameForm` component is a functional React component that takes in two props: `filename` and `setFilename`. It uses the `FilenameInput` component to render an input field for the filename. The `FilenameInput` component is imported from another file and is responsible for the actual input handling and rendering logic. The `Paths` utility is used to manipulate and extract parts of the filename, such as the basename.

## References

- `FilenameInput`: A component imported from `filename-input.tsx` that handles the input logic for the filename.
- `Paths`: A utility module imported from `utils/paths` that provides functions for manipulating file paths.

## Symbols

### `FilenameForm`
#### Description
The `FilenameForm` component is responsible for rendering a filename input field in the editor's header. It uses the `FilenameInput` component to provide a user interface for entering or changing the filename. The component also manages the placeholder text based on the current filename and applies appropriate CSS classes.

#### Inputs
| Name      | Type     | Description                                      |
|:----------|:---------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| filename  | string \| null | The current filename, which can be null if not set. |
| setFilename | (filename: string) =&gt; void | A function to update the filename state. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | JSX.Element | The rendered filename input component. |

#### Internal Logic
- The component uses the `FilenameInput` component to render the input field.
- It sets the `placeholderText` to the basename of the filename if it exists, or defaults to "untitled marimo app" if the filename is null.
- The `initialValue` is set to the current filename.
- The `onNameChange` prop is set to the `setFilename` function to handle changes to the filename.
- The `flexibleWidth` and `resetOnBlur` props are set to `true` to allow dynamic width adjustment and reset the input on blur.
- The `className` is conditionally set based on whether the filename is null.

## Dependencies
