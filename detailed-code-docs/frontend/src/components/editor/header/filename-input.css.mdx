## High-level description
The CSS file `filename-input.css` is designed to style elements related to filename input fields in a web application's editor header. It defines styles for two classes, `.missing-filename` and `.filename`, focusing on text alignment, box shadows, and border radius to enhance the user interface and experience.

## Code Structure
The CSS file contains two main classes: `.missing-filename` and `.filename`. Each class has specific styles for default, hover, and focus states, which are used to visually differentiate between missing and existing filenames in the editor header.

## Symbols

### `.missing-filename`
#### Description
The `.missing-filename` class is used to style elements that represent a missing filename. It provides visual cues to the user by applying specific styles such as text alignment, box shadow, and border radius.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | This is a CSS class, so it does not take inputs in the traditional sense. It is applied to HTML elements. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | The output is the visual styling applied to HTML elements with this class. |

#### Internal Logic
- **Default State**: Centers the text and applies a light shadow using the `--light-shadow-stale` variable.
- **Hover and Focus States**: Changes the box shadow to a medium shadow using the `--medium-shadow-stale` variable.
- **Focus State**: Adds a border radius to the top corners to create a rounded effect.

### `.filename`
#### Description
The `.filename` class is used to style elements that represent an existing filename. It provides a clean and focused look by managing text alignment, box shadow, and border radius.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | This is a CSS class, so it does not take inputs in the traditional sense. It is applied to HTML elements. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | The output is the visual styling applied to HTML elements with this class. |

#### Internal Logic
- **Default State**: Centers the text and removes any box shadow.
- **Hover and Focus States**: Applies a medium shadow using the `--medium-shadow` variable.
- **Focus State**: Adds a border radius to the top corners to create a rounded effect.

## Dependencies
The CSS file relies on CSS variables (`--light-shadow-stale`, `--medium-shadow-stale`, and `--medium-shadow`) for defining shadow styles. These variables are likely defined elsewhere in the application's CSS or a global stylesheet.

## Performance Considerations
The use of CSS variables allows for easy theme adjustments and consistency across the application, which can improve maintainability and performance by reducing the need for repetitive style definitions.

## Side Effects
There are no side effects in the traditional sense, as this is a CSS file. However, applying these styles will visually alter the appearance of elements with the `.missing-filename` and `.filename` classes.

## Configuration
There are no configuration options within this CSS file itself, but the appearance can be adjusted by modifying the CSS variables used for shadows.

## Error Handling
There is no error handling in CSS files, as they are declarative and do not execute logic like JavaScript.

## Logging
There is no logging in CSS files.

## API/Interface Reference
This CSS file does not define an API or interface. It provides styling for HTML elements.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
