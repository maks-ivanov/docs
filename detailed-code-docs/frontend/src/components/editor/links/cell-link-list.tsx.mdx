## High-level description

The `cell-link-list.tsx` file defines a React component named `CellLinkList`. This component is responsible for rendering a list of links to cells, with a maximum number of links displayed initially. If there are more links than the specified maximum, the additional links are accessible via a popover. This component is used to manage and display cell links in a user interface, providing a way to navigate or interact with different cells in a structured manner.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in this file is the `CellLinkList` component. It utilizes several other components and hooks, such as `CellLink`, `Popover`, `PopoverContent`, `PopoverTrigger`, and `useCellIds`. These components and hooks are used to render the list of cell links, manage the display of additional links in a popover, and sort the cell IDs based on their order in the notebook.

## References

- `CellLink`: A component used to render individual cell links.
- `Popover`, `PopoverContent`, `PopoverTrigger`: UI components used to create a popover for displaying additional cell links.
- `useCellIds`: A hook that provides access to the cell IDs and their order.

## Symbols

### `CellLinkList`
#### Description
The `CellLinkList` component renders a list of cell links, displaying a specified maximum number of links initially. If there are more links than the maximum, the additional links are shown in a popover. This component allows users to interact with or navigate to different cells in a structured manner.

#### Inputs
| Name      | Type       | Description                                                                 |
|:----------|:-----------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| maxCount  | number     | The maximum number of cell links to display initially.                      |
| cellIds   | CellId[]   | An array of cell IDs to be displayed as links.                              |
| skipScroll| boolean    | Optional. If true, scrolling is skipped when a link is clicked.             |
| onClick   | function   | Optional. A callback function that is called when a cell link is clicked.   |

#### Outputs
The component does not return any outputs but renders UI elements.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Sorting Cell IDs**: The component uses the `useCellIds` hook to get the order of cell IDs and sorts the provided `cellIds` array based on this order.
2. **Rendering Links**: It maps over the sorted cell IDs and renders a `CellLink` component for each, up to the specified `maxCount`.
3. **Handling Overflow**: If there are more cell IDs than `maxCount`, it renders a `Popover` with a trigger that displays the number of additional links. The popover contains the remaining `CellLink` components.

| `CellLink` | Renders individual cell links.                                          |
| `Popover`, `PopoverContent`, `PopoverTrigger` | Used to create a popover for additional links. |
| `useCellIds` | Provides the order of cell IDs for sorting.                           |

## Error Handling
The component does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the inputs are valid and that the `useCellIds` hook provides the necessary data.
