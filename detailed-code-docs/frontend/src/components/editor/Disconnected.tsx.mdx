### `Disconnected`
#### Description
The `Disconnected` component is a React functional component designed to display a message indicating the reason for a disconnection. It is a simple UI component that renders a paragraph containing the disconnection reason.

#### Inputs
| Name   | Type   | Description                        |
|:-------|:-------|:-----------------------------------|
| reason | string | The reason for the disconnection.  |

#### Outputs
The component does not produce any outputs in the traditional sense, as it is a UI component. It renders a `div` element containing a paragraph with the disconnection reason.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses JSX to return a `div` element with an `id` of "Disconnected". Inside this `div`, it renders a `p` element that displays the `reason` prop.

## References
