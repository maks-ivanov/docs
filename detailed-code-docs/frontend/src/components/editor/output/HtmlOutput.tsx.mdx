## High-level description

The `HtmlOutput.tsx` file defines a React functional component named `HtmlOutput` that is responsible for rendering HTML content within a React application. It uses the `renderHTML` function to safely parse and render HTML strings, and it conditionally applies CSS classes to the rendered content based on the component's props.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in this file is the `HtmlOutput` component, which is a memoized React functional component. It utilizes the `renderHTML` function from the `RenderHTML.tsx` file to parse and render HTML content. The `cn` utility function is used to conditionally apply CSS classes to the component's container.

## Symbols

### `HtmlOutput`
#### Description
The `HtmlOutput` component is designed to render HTML content passed to it as a string. It uses the `renderHTML` function to parse the HTML and render it safely within a `div` element. The component can render the content either inline or as a block, depending on the `inline` prop, and it can also accept additional CSS classes through the `className` prop.

#### Inputs
| Name      | Type   | Description                                      |
|:----------|:-------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| html      | string | The HTML content to be rendered.                 |
| inline    | boolean| Optional. Determines if the content is inline.   |
| className | string | Optional. Additional CSS classes for the element.|

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX  | JSX.Element | The rendered HTML content wrapped in a `div`. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for HTML Content**: The component first checks if the `html` prop is provided. If not, it returns `null`, rendering nothing.
2. **Class Name Construction**: It uses the `cn` utility function to construct the class name for the `div` element. This function merges the provided `className` with either `inline-flex` or `block` based on the `inline` prop.
3. **Render HTML**: The `renderHTML` function is called with the `html` prop to parse and render the HTML content safely.

## References

- **`renderHTML`**: This function is imported from `RenderHTML.tsx` and is responsible for parsing and rendering the HTML content.
- **`cn`**: This utility function is imported from `cn.ts` and is used to conditionally apply CSS classes.

## Error Handling

The component does not implement specific error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the `html` prop is a valid string and relies on the `renderHTML` function to handle any parsing issues.
