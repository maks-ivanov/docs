title: "CalloutOutput.styles.ts"

## High-level description

The `CalloutOutput.styles.ts` file defines a set of styles for a callout component using the `class-variance-authority` library. It provides a flexible styling mechanism that allows different visual variants of the callout component based on the `kind` property, such as `neutral`, `info`, `danger`, `warn`, and `success`.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in this file is the `calloutStyles` constant, which is a style configuration object created using the `cva` function from the `class-variance-authority` library. This object defines the base styles and variant-specific styles for the callout component.

## Symbols

### `calloutStyles`
#### Description
The `calloutStyles` constant is a style configuration object that defines the base and variant-specific styles for a callout component. It uses the `cva` function to create a set of CSS classes that can be applied to the component based on the `kind` variant.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| kind | string | The variant of the callout, which determines the specific styles applied. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | string | A string of CSS classes that apply the appropriate styles for the specified variant. |

#### Internal Logic
The `calloutStyles` object is created using the `cva` function, which takes a base style string and an options object. The options object defines the `variants` and `defaultVariants`:
- **Base Styles**: `"border rounded-lg p-12 mt-12 mb-12 text-foreground shadow-[4px_4px_0px_0px]"` are the default styles applied to all callouts.
- **Variants**: The `kind` property can be set to different values (`neutral`, `alert`, `info`, `danger`, `warn`, `success`), each applying specific background, border, and shadow colors.
- **Default Variant**: If no `kind` is specified, the `neutral` variant is used by default.

## References

- The `calloutStyles` is used in the `CalloutOutput.tsx` file to apply styles to the `CalloutOutput` component based on the `kind` prop.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `class-variance-authority` | Used to create a flexible and composable style configuration for the callout component. |

## Error Handling

There is no explicit error handling in this file, as it primarily deals with style definitions.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in this file.

## TODOs

- The `alert` variant is marked as deprecated, with a note to use the `danger` variant instead. This suggests a future cleanup or removal of the `alert` variant.
