## High-level description

The target file `traceback.test.tsx` contains unit tests for the `MarimoTracebackOutput` component, which is responsible for rendering and manipulating traceback information in a user-friendly format. The tests ensure that the component correctly transforms and displays traceback data, including replacing certain keywords and generating links for traceback lines.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the test cases defined within the `describe` blocks. These tests interact with the `MarimoTracebackOutput` component and the `renderHTML` function to verify the correct transformation and rendering of traceback data. The tests use the `render` function from `@testing-library/react` to render components and check their output.

## Symbols

### `describe("traceback component", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This block contains tests related to the `MarimoTracebackOutput` component's ability to extract and transform traceback information.

#### Internal Logic
- **Test "extracts cell-link"**: Verifies that the component correctly parses and generates links from the traceback data.
- **Test "renames File to Cell for relevant lines"**: Ensures that the component replaces the word "File" with "Cell" in the appropriate lines of the traceback.

### `describe("traceback replacement", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This block contains tests for the functions that replace specific parts of the traceback, such as filenames and prefixes.

#### Internal Logic
- **Test "replaces File with Cell"**: Checks that the `replaceTracebackPrefix` function correctly replaces "File" with "Cell" in the traceback.
- **Test "renames filenames"**: Validates that the `replaceTracebackFilenames` function correctly transforms filenames in the traceback to a specific format.

## References

- **`MarimoTracebackOutput`**: A component imported from `../MarimoTracebackOutput`, responsible for rendering traceback information.
- **`replaceTracebackPrefix` and `replaceTracebackFilenames`**: Functions imported from `../MarimoTracebackOutput` that perform specific transformations on the traceback data.
- **`renderHTML`**: A function imported from `@/plugins/core/RenderHTML` used to parse and render HTML content with additional transformations.

## Error Handling

The tests use assertions to verify expected outcomes. If an assertion fails, it indicates a discrepancy between the expected and actual behavior of the component or function being tested.

## Logging

No explicit logging is implemented in the test file. The focus is on assertions to validate behavior.

## API/Interface Reference

The file does not define an API or public interface. It tests the behavior of components and functions within the application.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
