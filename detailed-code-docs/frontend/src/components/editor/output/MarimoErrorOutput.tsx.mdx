## High-level description

The `MarimoErrorOutput` component in the `MarimoErrorOutput.tsx` file is designed to render a list of errors related to Marimo semantics violations. It processes different types of errors, such as syntax errors, cycle errors, and exceptions, and displays them in a structured format using UI components like alerts and accordions. The component provides contextual tips and links to help users understand and resolve the errors.

## Code Structure

- The `MarimoErrorOutput` component is the main export of the file and is responsible for rendering error messages.
- The `Tip` component is a helper component used within `MarimoErrorOutput` to provide additional guidance or suggestions for resolving errors.
- The `MarimoErrorOutput` component utilizes several UI components such as `Alert`, `AlertTitle`, and `Accordion` to format and display error messages.

### `MarimoErrorOutput`
#### Description
The `MarimoErrorOutput` component renders a list of errors related to Marimo semantics. It categorizes errors based on their type and provides specific messages and tips for each type. The component uses various UI elements to format the output, such as alerts and accordions.

#### Inputs

#### Internal Logic
- The component initializes variables for the alert title, variant, and text color.
- It maps over the `errors` array, using a switch statement to handle different error types.
- For each error type, it constructs a specific JSX structure, including error messages, lists of involved cells, and tips for resolution.
- The `Alert` component is used to display the overall error message, with the `AlertTitle` component showing the title.

## Side Effects
- The `logNever` function is called for unexpected error types, logging a warning without throwing an error.
