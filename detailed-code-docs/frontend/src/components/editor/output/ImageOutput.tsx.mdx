## High-level description

The `ImageOutput` component in the `ImageOutput.tsx` file is a React functional component designed to render an image within a span element. It accepts several properties, such as the image source, alternative text, dimensions, and additional CSS classes, to customize the rendering of the image.

## Code Structure

The `ImageOutput` component is a standalone functional component that utilizes TypeScript for type checking. It is used in other parts of the codebase, such as the `OutputRenderer` component in the `Output.tsx` file, to render image outputs based on specific MIME types.

## Symbols

### `ImageOutput`
#### Description
The `ImageOutput` component is responsible for rendering an image element within a span. It provides flexibility in specifying the image source, alternative text, width, height, and additional CSS classes for styling purposes.

#### Internal Logic
The component returns a span element containing an img element. The img element uses the provided `src`, `alt`, `width`, and `height` properties. The span can be styled using the `className` property.

## References

- The `ImageOutput` component is imported and used in the `OutputRenderer` component within the `Output.tsx` file. It is utilized to render images when the MIME type of the data is one of several image formats (e.g., `image/png`, `image/jpeg`).

## Dependencies

The `ImageOutput` component does not have any external dependencies. It relies on React and TypeScript, which are part of the broader project setup.

## Error Handling

The `ImageOutput` component does not implement specific error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the provided `src` is a valid image URL. Any errors related to image loading would be handled by the browser's default behavior.

## Logging

The `ImageOutput` component does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## TODOs
