## High-level description

The `notebook-menu-dropdown.tsx` file defines a React component called `NotebookMenuDropdown`. This component is responsible for rendering a dropdown menu in a notebook editor interface, providing users with various actions they can perform on the notebook. These actions include sharing, downloading, and managing notebook cells, among others. The component leverages a set of UI components to create a structured and interactive dropdown menu.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are interconnected as follows:
- `NotebookMenuDropdown`: The main React component that renders the dropdown menu.
- `useNotebookActions`: A hook that provides a list of actions available in the dropdown menu.
- `DropdownMenu` and related components: UI components used to construct the dropdown menu.
- `renderLabel` and `renderLeafAction`: Helper functions to render individual menu items and their labels.

## Symbols

### `NotebookMenuDropdown`
#### Description
The `NotebookMenuDropdown` component renders a dropdown menu button in the notebook editor. When clicked, it displays a list of actions that users can perform on the notebook, such as sharing, downloading, and managing cells. The component uses a button with a menu icon as the trigger for the dropdown.

#### Inputs
None directly, but it uses hooks and components that may have their own inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React Element | The rendered dropdown menu component. |

#### Internal Logic
- The component uses the `useNotebookActions` hook to retrieve a list of actions.
- It defines a button element that serves as the trigger for the dropdown menu.
- The `renderLabel` function is used to format the display of each action, including its icon, label, hotkey, and any additional elements.
- The `renderLeafAction` function creates individual menu items for actions that do not have submenus.
- The dropdown menu is constructed using `DropdownMenu` components, with support for nested submenus and separators.

## References

- **`useNotebookActions`**: This hook is crucial as it provides the list of actions that populate the dropdown menu.
- **`getMarimoVersion`**: A function used to display the current version of the Marimo application at the bottom of the dropdown menu.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `React` | Used for creating the component and JSX elements. |
| `lucide-react` | Provides the `MenuIcon` and other icons used in the menu. |
| `@/components/ui/dropdown-menu` | Supplies the dropdown menu components used to build the menu structure. |
| `@/components/editor/inputs/Inputs` | Provides the `Button` component used for the menu trigger. |
| `@/core/dom/marimo-tag` | Provides the `getMarimoVersion` function to display the application version. |

## Error Handling

The component does not explicitly handle errors, but it relies on the robustness of the imported hooks and components. Any errors in rendering or action handling would likely be managed by those underlying systems.

## Logging

There is no explicit logging implemented in this component.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
