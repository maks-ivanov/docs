## High-level description

The target file `documentation.css` is a CSS stylesheet that defines the styling for documentation elements within a web application. It includes styles for various HTML elements such as lists, paragraphs, tables, code blocks, and headings, with specific styles applied when these elements are displayed within a tooltip.

## Code Structure

The CSS file is structured to apply styles to a class named `.docs-documentation` and its child elements. It also includes specific styles for when the `.docs-documentation` class is used within a tooltip, indicated by the `.mo-cm-tooltip.docs-documentation` class.

## Symbols

### `.docs-documentation`
#### Description
This class is used to style documentation content. It applies specific styles to elements like ordered and unordered lists, paragraphs, sections, tables, code blocks, and headings to ensure consistent formatting and appearance.

#### Internal Logic
- **Lists (`ol`, `ul`)**: Styled with specific list-style types and padding.
- **Paragraphs (`p`)**: Given padding and set to pre-wrap whitespace.
- **Tables**: Styled with borders, padding, and alternating row colors.
- **Code Blocks (`code`)**: Styled with a border, padding, and a specific background color.
- **Headings (`h1`)**: Styled with a specific font weight, size, and border.
- **Blockquotes**: Styled with padding and specific text formatting.

### `.mo-cm-tooltip.docs-documentation`
#### Description
This class is used to override the styles of `.docs-documentation` when it is displayed within a tooltip. It adjusts font sizes and other styles to fit the tooltip context.

#### Internal Logic
- **Font Sizes**: Reduced for elements like headings and code blocks to fit within the tooltip.
- **Blockquotes**: Adjusted text size for better readability in a tooltip.
