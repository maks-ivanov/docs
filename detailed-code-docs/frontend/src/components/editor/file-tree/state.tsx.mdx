## High-level description

The target file, `state.tsx`, is responsible for managing the state of a file tree in a file explorer component within a React application. It utilizes the Jotai library to create and manage global state atoms that persist even when components are unmounted. The file defines a `treeAtom` to manage the file tree structure and an `openStateAtom` to track which folders are open. It also provides a `refreshRoot` function to refresh the root of the file tree.

## Code Structure

- **Atoms**: The file defines two Jotai atoms, `treeAtom` and `openStateAtom`, which are used to manage the state of the file tree and the open state of folders, respectively.
- **Functions**: The `refreshRoot` function is defined to refresh the entire file tree by invoking the `refreshAll` method on the `RequestingTree` instance stored in `treeAtom`.

## References

- **`RequestingTree`**: This class is imported from `./requesting-tree` and is used to manage the file tree operations such as listing, creating, deleting, and renaming files or folders.
- **Network Requests**: The file imports several functions from `@/core/network/requests` to perform network operations related to file management.
- **Jotai Store**: The `store` from `@/core/state/jotai` is used to access and manipulate the global state outside of React components.

## Symbols

### `treeAtom`
#### Description
`treeAtom` is a Jotai atom that holds an instance of `RequestingTree`. It manages the state of the file tree, including operations like listing, creating, deleting, and renaming files or folders.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `RequestingTree` | Class | An instance of `RequestingTree` initialized with network request functions. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `treeAtom` | Atom&lt;RequestingTree&gt; | A Jotai atom containing the `RequestingTree` instance. |

### `openStateAtom`
#### Description
`openStateAtom` is a Jotai atom that maintains a record of which folders in the file tree are currently open. This state persists even when the component is unmounted.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `Record&lt;string, boolean&gt;` | Type | An object mapping folder IDs to their open state (true for open, false for closed). |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `openStateAtom` | Atom&lt;Record&lt;string, boolean&gt;&gt; | A Jotai atom containing the open state of folders. |

### `refreshRoot`
#### Description
`refreshRoot` is an asynchronous function that refreshes the entire file tree by calling the `refreshAll` method on the `RequestingTree` instance stored in `treeAtom`.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- The function retrieves the current `RequestingTree` instance from `treeAtom` using the Jotai store.
- It calls the `refreshAll` method on the `RequestingTree` instance with an empty array, indicating that the entire tree should be refreshed.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `jotai` | Used for creating and managing global state atoms. |
| `@/core/network/requests` | Provides network request functions for file operations. |
| `@/core/state/jotai` | Provides the global Jotai store for state management. |

## Error Handling
The file does not implement specific error handling mechanisms. Error handling is likely managed within the `RequestingTree` class or the network request functions.

## Logging
The file does not implement any logging mechanisms. Logging, if any, would be handled in other parts of the application, such as within the network request functions or the `RequestingTree` class.
