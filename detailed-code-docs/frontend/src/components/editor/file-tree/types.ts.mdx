## High-level description

The target file, `types.ts`, defines types and utility functions for handling file types within a file tree component in a frontend application. It provides a mechanism to guess the file type based on file extensions, associates icons with each file type, and generates Python code snippets for handling files of different types.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are interconnected as follows:
- `FileType`: A TypeScript type that enumerates possible file types.
- `guessFileType`: A function that determines the file type based on a file's extension.
- `FILE_TYPE_ICONS`: A mapping from `FileType` to corresponding icons.
- `PYTHON_CODE_FOR_FILE_TYPE`: A mapping from `FileType` to Python code snippets for handling files.

## Symbols

### `FileType`
#### Description
`FileType` is a TypeScript type that enumerates the possible types of files that can be handled by the file tree component. It includes types like "directory", "python", "code", "json", "text", "image", "audio", "video", "data", "pdf", "zip", and "unknown".

### `guessFileType`
#### Description
The `guessFileType` function determines the type of a file based on its extension. It returns a `FileType` value corresponding to the file's extension.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | The name of the file, including its extension. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | FileType | The determined file type based on the file's extension. |

#### Internal Logic
- The function splits the file name to extract the extension.
- It uses a switch statement to match the extension to a predefined set of file types.
- If the extension is not recognized, it returns "unknown".

### `FILE_TYPE_ICONS`
#### Description
`FILE_TYPE_ICONS` is a constant that maps each `FileType` to a corresponding icon from the `lucide-react` library. This allows the UI to display an appropriate icon for each file type.

### `PYTHON_CODE_FOR_FILE_TYPE`
#### Description
`PYTHON_CODE_FOR_FILE_TYPE` is a constant that maps each `FileType` to a Python code snippet. These snippets provide a template for how to handle files of each type in Python, such as reading a file or listing a directory.

## References

- The `guessFileType` function and `FILE_TYPE_ICONS` are used in other components like `file-explorer.tsx` and `filename-input.tsx` to determine file types and display appropriate icons.
- `PYTHON_CODE_FOR_FILE_TYPE` is used to generate Python code snippets for file operations, as seen in the `file-explorer.tsx`.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `lucide-react` | Provides icons used in the `FILE_TYPE_ICONS` mapping. |

## Error Handling

The `guessFileType` function handles the case where a file has no extension by returning "unknown". This ensures that the function always returns a valid `FileType`.
