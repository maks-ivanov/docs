## High-level description

The `kiosk-mode.tsx` file defines two React components, `HideInKioskMode` and `ShowInKioskMode`, which conditionally render their children based on the application's kiosk mode state. These components utilize the `kioskModeAtom` from the Jotai state management library to determine whether the application is in kiosk mode and render their children accordingly.

## Code Structure

The file contains two main components:

- `HideInKioskMode`: Renders its children only when the application is not in kiosk mode.
- `ShowInKioskMode`: Renders its children only when the application is in kiosk mode.

Both components rely on the `kioskModeAtom` to determine the current mode of the application.

## References

- `kioskModeAtom`: An atom from the Jotai library that holds the state of the kiosk mode, imported from `@/core/mode`.

## Symbols

### `HideInKioskMode`
#### Description
The `HideInKioskMode` component conditionally renders its children based on the kiosk mode state. It hides its children when the application is in kiosk mode.

#### Inputs
| Name     | Type            | Description          |
|:---------|:----------------|:---------------------|
| children | React.ReactNode | The elements to render conditionally based on the kiosk mode state. |

#### Outputs
| Name     | Type            | Description          |
|:---------|:----------------|:---------------------|
| children | React.ReactNode | The children are rendered if the application is not in kiosk mode; otherwise, `null` is returned. |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the `useAtomValue` hook from Jotai to access the current value of `kioskModeAtom`.
- Checks if `kioskMode` is `true`. If so, it returns `null`, effectively hiding the children. Otherwise, it returns the children.

### `ShowInKioskMode`
#### Description
The `ShowInKioskMode` component conditionally renders its children based on the kiosk mode state. It shows its children only when the application is in kiosk mode.

#### Inputs
| Name     | Type            | Description          |
|:---------|:----------------|:---------------------|
| children | React.ReactNode | The elements to render conditionally based on the kiosk mode state. |

#### Outputs
| Name     | Type            | Description          |
|:---------|:----------------|:---------------------|
| children | React.ReactNode | The children are rendered if the application is in kiosk mode; otherwise, `null` is returned. |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the `useAtomValue` hook from Jotai to access the current value of `kioskModeAtom`.
- Checks if `kioskMode` is `true`. If so, it returns the children. Otherwise, it returns `null`.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `jotai`    | Used for state management, specifically to access the `kioskModeAtom` which determines the kiosk mode state. |
| `React`    | Provides the base for creating React components. |

## Error Handling

There is no explicit error handling in this file, as the components are straightforward and rely on the state provided by `kioskModeAtom`.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in this file.

## API/Interface Reference

This file does not define an API or public interface beyond the two React components.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
