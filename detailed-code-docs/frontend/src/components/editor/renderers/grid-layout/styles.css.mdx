## High-level description
The CSS file defines styles for a grid layout component used in a React application. It customizes the appearance and behavior of grid items, including placeholder items, resizable handles, and images within grid items. Additionally, it provides styles for different themes and states, such as dark mode and animations.

## Code Structure
The CSS file is structured to target specific classes and states within a grid layout component. It uses CSS selectors to apply styles to elements based on their class names and pseudo-classes.

## Symbols

### `.react-grid-item.react-grid-placeholder`
#### Description
This class targets grid items that are placeholders, setting their background color to a variable `--grass-9`.

### `.react-resizable-handle`
#### Description
This class targets the resizable handle of grid items, initially setting its visibility to hidden.

### `.react-grid-item:hover .react-resizable-handle`
#### Description
When a grid item is hovered over, this rule makes the resizable handle visible.

### `.dark .react-grid-item &gt; .react-resizable-handle::after`
#### Description
In dark mode, this rule applies a border to the resizable handle's pseudo-element, using a semi-transparent white color.

### `.disable-animation .react-grid-item`
#### Description
This class disables transitions for grid items, ensuring no animations occur by setting the transition properties to none.

### `.react-grid-item .output img`
#### Description
This rule ensures that images within grid items fill the entire height of the grid item and maintain their aspect ratio using `object-fit: contain`.

### `#App.grid-bordered`
#### Description
This ID and class combination sets the background color of the app to a variable `--slate-1` when the `grid-bordered` class is applied.

## References
- The CSS file references CSS variables like `--grass-9` and `--slate-1`, which are likely defined elsewhere in the application's stylesheets.

## Dependencies
The CSS file does not directly reference external libraries, but it is likely used in conjunction with a React grid layout library that provides the class names like `.react-grid-item` and `.react-resizable-handle`.

## Configuration
The CSS file uses CSS variables for colors, which allows for easy theming and customization of the grid layout's appearance.

## Error Handling
There is no error handling in CSS files, as they are purely for styling purposes.

## Logging
There is no logging in CSS files, as they are purely for styling purposes.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
