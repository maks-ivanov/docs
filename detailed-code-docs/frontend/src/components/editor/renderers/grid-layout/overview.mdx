## High-level description

The `grid-layout` subdirectory within the frontend component of the application is designed to manage and render grid layouts in a React-based user interface. It provides a comprehensive system for creating, editing, and displaying grid layouts, which are composed of individual cells that can be customized in terms of size, position, and content. The directory includes components for rendering the grid, a plugin for handling grid layout data, styles for visual presentation, and TypeScript types for defining the structure of grid layouts.

## What does it do?

The `grid-layout` system allows users to interact with a grid-based interface where they can drag, drop, and resize cells. This is particularly useful in applications that require a flexible and dynamic layout, such as dashboards or content management systems. Users can switch between read and edit modes, with the latter providing additional controls for modifying the grid's properties, such as the number of columns, row height, and cell alignment. The system also supports serialization and deserialization of grid layouts, enabling layouts to be saved and loaded as needed.

## Entry points

The main entry point for the grid layout functionality is the `grid-layout.tsx` file, which contains the `GridLayoutRenderer` component. This component is responsible for rendering the grid and managing user interactions. It integrates with the `plugin.tsx` file, which provides the `GridLayoutPlugin` for handling grid layout data, including validation, serialization, and deserialization. The `types.ts` file defines the TypeScript interfaces and types used throughout the grid layout system, ensuring that data structures are consistent and type-safe.

## Key Files

- **`grid-layout.tsx`**: Contains the `GridLayoutRenderer` component, which is the core of the grid layout system. It manages the rendering and interaction of grid cells, supporting both read and edit modes.
- **`plugin.tsx`**: Defines the `GridLayoutPlugin`, which handles the validation, serialization, and deserialization of grid layout data. It ensures that grid layouts are correctly configured and can be persisted.
- **`styles.css`**: Provides the CSS styles for the grid layout, including themes, animations, and responsive design elements. It customizes the appearance of grid items and their interactive elements.
- **`types.ts`**: Defines the TypeScript types and interfaces for grid layouts, including serialized and deserialized forms. It ensures that grid layout data is structured and managed consistently.

## Dependencies

- **`react-grid-layout`**: A library used to provide the grid layout functionality, enabling responsive and interactive grid systems.
- **`lodash-es`**: Utilized for utility functions, such as string manipulation.
- **`@radix-ui/react-icons`**: Supplies icons for UI elements within the grid layout.
- **`zod`**: A schema validation library used in the `plugin.tsx` file to ensure that serialized grid layout data is valid.
- **`@/core/cells/ids`**: Provides the `CellId` type, which is used to uniquely identify cells within the grid layout.

## Configuration

The grid layout system uses CSS variables for theming and customization, allowing for easy adjustments to the appearance of the grid. The `styles.css` file references these variables to apply consistent styling across different themes and states, such as dark mode and animations.
