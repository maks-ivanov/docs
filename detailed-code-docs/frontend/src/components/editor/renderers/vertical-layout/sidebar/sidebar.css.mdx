## High-level description

The CSS file `sidebar.css` is responsible for styling the sidebar component in a web application. It defines styles for markdown content within the sidebar, sets up a container query to manage the sidebar's layout based on its width, and controls the visibility of markdown content when the sidebar is not expanded.

## Code Structure

The CSS file primarily consists of three style rules:
1. Styling markdown content within the sidebar.
2. Defining a container query for the sidebar.
3. Controlling the display of markdown content based on the sidebar's expansion state.
