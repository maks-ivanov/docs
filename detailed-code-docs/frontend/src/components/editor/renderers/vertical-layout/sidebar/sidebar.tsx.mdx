## High-level description

The code in the target file defines a `Sidebar` component for a web application's user interface. This component is responsible for rendering a collapsible sidebar that can be toggled open or closed. It uses CSS classes to manage its appearance and transitions, and it includes a toggle button and a slot for additional content.

## Code Structure

The `Sidebar` component is the main symbol in this file. It utilizes two other components: `SidebarToggle` and `SidebarSlot`. The `SidebarToggle` component is responsible for rendering the button that toggles the sidebar's open or closed state. The `SidebarSlot` component is a placeholder for additional content that can be inserted into the sidebar. The `cn` utility function is used to manage CSS class names dynamically.

## Symbols

### `Sidebar`
#### Description
The `Sidebar` component renders a collapsible sidebar that can be toggled open or closed. It uses CSS transitions to animate the width of the sidebar and includes a toggle button and a content slot.

#### Inputs
| Name   | Type     | Description                          |
|:-------|:---------|:-------------------------------------|
| isOpen | boolean  | Indicates whether the sidebar is open. |
| toggle | function | A function to toggle the sidebar's open state. |

#### Outputs
The `Sidebar` component does not have direct outputs but renders UI elements based on its inputs.

#### Internal Logic
- The `Sidebar` component uses the `cn` utility function to dynamically assign CSS classes based on the `isOpen` state.
- It renders an `&lt;aside&gt;` element with a class that changes its width depending on whether the sidebar is open or closed.
- The `SidebarToggle` component is included to provide a button for toggling the sidebar's state.
- The `SidebarSlot` component is included as a placeholder for additional content within the sidebar.

### `SidebarToggle`
#### Description
The `SidebarToggle` component renders a button that allows the user to toggle the sidebar's open or closed state. It uses an icon that rotates based on the sidebar's state.

#### Inputs
| Name   | Type     | Description                          |
|:-------|:---------|:-------------------------------------|
| isOpen | boolean  | Indicates whether the sidebar is open. |
| toggle | function | A function to toggle the sidebar's open state. |

#### Outputs
The `SidebarToggle` component does not have direct outputs but renders a button that interacts with the `toggle` function.

#### Internal Logic
- The component uses the `cn` utility function to dynamically assign CSS classes to the icon, rotating it based on the `isOpen` state.
- It renders a `Button` component from the UI library, which triggers the `toggle` function when clicked.
