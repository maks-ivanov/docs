## High-level description

The `WrappedWithSidebar` component is a React functional component that wraps its children with a sidebar layout. It manages the sidebar's open/close state using a state management library and conditionally renders the sidebar based on the presence of elements in a specific slot. The component also integrates a transition effect for the main content area when the sidebar is toggled.

## Code Structure

- **`WrappedWithSidebar`**: The main component that wraps its children with a sidebar.
- **`useAtom`**: Used to manage the sidebar's open/close state.
- **`useSlot`**: Used to determine if there are elements in the sidebar slot.
- **`Sidebar`**: A component that represents the sidebar, which is conditionally rendered.
- **`SheetMenu`**: A component that provides a menu interface within the sidebar.
- **`cn`**: A utility function for merging and applying CSS class names.

## References

- **`sidebarAtom`**: A state atom that manages the sidebar's open/close state.
- **`SlotNames.SIDEBAR`**: A constant used to identify the sidebar slot.
- **`cn`**: A utility function for class name manipulation.

### `WrappedWithSidebar`
#### Description
The `WrappedWithSidebar` component is responsible for rendering its children with an optional sidebar. It uses state management to control the sidebar's visibility and applies a transition effect to the main content area when the sidebar is toggled.

#### Inputs
| Name     | Type            | Description          |
|:---------|:----------------|:---------------------|
| children | `React.ReactNode` | The content to be wrapped by the sidebar layout. |

#### Outputs
| Name     | Type            | Description          |
|:---------|:----------------|:---------------------|
| JSX Element | `React.FC&lt;Props&gt;` | The rendered component with optional sidebar. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **State Management**: Uses `useAtom` to access and dispatch the sidebar's open/close state.
2. **Slot Checking**: Uses `useSlot` to check if there are elements in the `SIDEBAR` slot.
3. **Conditional Rendering**: If no elements are present in the sidebar slot, it returns the children directly.
4. **Sidebar Rendering**: If elements are present, it renders the `Sidebar` component and the main content area with a transition effect.
5. **Transition Effect**: Applies a CSS transition to the main content area based on the sidebar's open/close state.
