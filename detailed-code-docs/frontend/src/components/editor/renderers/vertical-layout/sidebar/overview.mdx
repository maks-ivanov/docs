## High-level description

The directory contains components and utilities for managing a sidebar in a web application's user interface. The sidebar is designed to be collapsible and can be toggled open or closed. It includes components for rendering the sidebar, managing its state, and providing a slot for dynamic content insertion. The main components are `Sidebar`, `SidebarToggle`, `SidebarSlot`, and `WrappedWithSidebar`. Additionally, there are supporting files for state management, styling, and utility functions.

## What does it do?

The code implements a sidebar that can be toggled open or closed in a web application. The sidebar is part of a larger layout and can contain dynamic content. Here's how it works:

1. **Sidebar Rendering**: The `Sidebar` component is responsible for rendering the sidebar. It includes a toggle button (`SidebarToggle`) that allows users to open or close the sidebar. The sidebar's width changes based on its open or closed state, providing a smooth transition effect.

2. **Dynamic Content**: The `SidebarSlot` component acts as a placeholder for additional content that can be inserted into the sidebar. This allows the sidebar to display different content based on the application's needs.

3. **State Management**: The sidebar's open/closed state is managed using the Jotai library. The `sidebarAtom` is used to store the state, and actions can be dispatched to toggle the sidebar's visibility.

4. **Layout Integration**: The `WrappedWithSidebar` component wraps its children with a sidebar layout. It checks if there are elements in the sidebar slot and conditionally renders the sidebar. The main content area transitions smoothly when the sidebar is toggled.

5. **Styling**: The `sidebar.css` file provides styles for the sidebar, including markdown content styling and responsive design adjustments based on the sidebar's width.
