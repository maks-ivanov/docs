## High-level description

The `sheet-sidebar.tsx` file defines a React component named `SheetMenu` that provides a sidebar menu interface for a web application. This component utilizes a button to trigger the display of a sidebar, which is implemented using a sheet component. The sidebar contains a slot for additional content, allowing for dynamic content insertion.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are interconnected as follows:
- `SheetMenu` is the primary component that renders a sidebar menu.
- `Sheet`, `SheetContent`, and `SheetTrigger` are components imported from a UI library to manage the display and behavior of the sidebar.
- `Button` is used to create a clickable element that triggers the sidebar.
- `MenuIcon` is an icon displayed within the button.
- `SidebarSlot` is a component that represents a slot for additional content within the sidebar.

## References

- `Button` and `Sheet` components are imported from the UI library, which are crucial for rendering the sidebar and its trigger.
- `SidebarSlot` is imported from a sibling file and is used to render dynamic content within the sidebar.

## Symbols

### `SheetMenu`
#### Description
The `SheetMenu` component is a React functional component that renders a sidebar menu. It uses a button with a menu icon to trigger the display of a sidebar, which slides in from the left. The sidebar contains a slot for additional content, allowing for dynamic content insertion.

#### Inputs
This component does not take any explicit props or inputs.

#### Outputs
This component does not produce any direct outputs but renders UI elements.

#### Internal Logic
- The `Sheet` component acts as a container for the sidebar.
- `SheetTrigger` is used to define the button that triggers the sidebar. It is styled to be hidden on large screens (`lg:hidden`) and uses the `Button` component with a `ghost` variant.
- `SheetContent` defines the content area of the sidebar, specifying its width, padding, and alignment. It contains the `SidebarSlot` component, which allows for dynamic content insertion.
