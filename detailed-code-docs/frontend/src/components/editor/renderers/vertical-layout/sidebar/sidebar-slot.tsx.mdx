## High-level description

The `sidebar-slot.tsx` file defines a React functional component named `SidebarSlot`. This component utilizes the `Slot` component from the `@marimo-team/react-slotz` library to render a slot with the name specified by `SlotNames.SIDEBAR`. The component is memoized using React's `memo` function to optimize rendering performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.

## Code Structure

- The `SidebarSlot` component is the main symbol in this file.
- It uses the `Slot` component from the `@marimo-team/react-slotz` library.
- The `SlotNames` object from the `slots.ts` file is used to specify the slot name.

## References

- `Slot` from `@marimo-team/react-slotz`: This is the component used to render the slot.
- `SlotNames` from `@/core/slots/slots`: This provides the name of the slot to be rendered.

## Symbols

### `SidebarSlot`
#### Description
