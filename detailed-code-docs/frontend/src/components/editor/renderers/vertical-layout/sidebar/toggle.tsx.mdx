## High-level description

The `toggle.tsx` file defines a React component named `SidebarToggle` that provides a button to toggle the visibility of a sidebar in a user interface. The button uses an icon that rotates based on the sidebar's open or closed state, providing a visual cue to the user.

## Code Structure

The `SidebarToggle` component is a functional React component that takes in two props: `isOpen` and `toggle`. It utilizes the `Button` component from the UI library and the `ChevronLeft` icon from the `lucide-react` library. The `cn` utility function is used to manage CSS class names dynamically.

## Symbols

### `SidebarToggle`
#### Description
The `SidebarToggle` component renders a button that toggles the sidebar's visibility. It visually indicates the sidebar's state (open or closed) by rotating an icon.

#### Inputs
| Name   | Type     | Description                                      |
|:-------|:---------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| isOpen | boolean  | Indicates whether the sidebar is currently open. |
| toggle | function | A function to toggle the sidebar's open state.   |

#### Outputs
This component does not produce any direct outputs but interacts with the UI by toggling the sidebar's visibility.

#### Internal Logic
- The component renders a `div` that is only visible on large screens (`lg:visible`).
- Inside the `div`, a `Button` component is rendered with an `onClick` event handler set to the `toggle` function.
- The `ChevronLeft` icon is used within the button, and its rotation is controlled by the `isOpen` prop. If `isOpen` is true, the icon is not rotated; otherwise, it is rotated 180 degrees.

## References

- **`Button`**: Imported from `@/components/ui/button`, it is used to render the toggle button with specific styles and behaviors.
- **`ChevronLeft`**: Imported from `lucide-react`, it provides the icon used in the toggle button.
- **`cn`**: A utility function from `@/utils/cn` that combines and merges CSS class names.

## Error Handling

The component does not implement specific error handling mechanisms, as it primarily deals with UI rendering and state toggling.

## Logging

There are no logging mechanisms implemented in this component.

## Performance Considerations

The component is lightweight and primarily involves rendering a button with an icon. The use of CSS transitions for the icon's rotation is efficient and should not impact performance significantly.
