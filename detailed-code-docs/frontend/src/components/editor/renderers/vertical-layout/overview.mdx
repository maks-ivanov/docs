## High-level description

The `vertical-layout` directory is part of a web application's frontend, specifically designed to manage and render a vertical layout for a notebook-like interface. It includes components and utilities for rendering a sidebar, managing layout visibility, and handling the display of notebook cells. The main components include a collapsible sidebar, a vertical layout renderer for notebook cells, and utilities for managing component visibility and layout styling. The directory integrates with state management and styling libraries to provide a responsive and interactive user interface.

## What does it do?

The code in this directory implements a vertical layout system for a notebook application, which includes a sidebar and a main content area for displaying notebook cells. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Sidebar Management**: The sidebar can be toggled open or closed, allowing users to manage additional content or tools. It includes components like `Sidebar`, `SidebarToggle`, and `SidebarSlot` for rendering and managing the sidebar's state and content.

2. **Dynamic Content Integration**: The sidebar can host dynamic content through the `SidebarSlot` component, which acts as a placeholder for various content types based on the application's needs.

3. **State Management**: The sidebar's visibility state is managed using the Jotai library, allowing for efficient state updates and reactivity within the application.

4. **Vertical Layout Rendering**: The `VerticalLayoutRenderer` component is responsible for rendering notebook cells in a vertical layout. It handles the display of cell code and outputs, manages visibility settings, and provides options for downloading the notebook content.

5. **Visibility Management**: The `useDelayVisibility` hook introduces a delay in making components visible, reducing flickering during loading and preventing premature focus on cell editors.

6. **Responsive Design**: The `VerticalLayoutWrapper` component applies responsive styling to ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes and configurations.

7. **Action Controls**: The `ActionButtons` component provides UI controls for toggling code visibility and downloading the notebook as HTML or PNG.
