## High-level description

The `VerticalLayoutWrapper` component in the target file is a React functional component designed to wrap its children within a vertically oriented layout. It applies specific styling based on the application's configuration and visibility settings. The component is part of a larger system that manages the layout and rendering of content in a web application, particularly focusing on responsive design and conditional visibility.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in the code is the `VerticalLayoutWrapper` component. It utilizes the `cn` utility function to conditionally apply CSS classes based on the properties passed to it. The component is designed to be flexible, allowing for different configurations and visibility states, which are determined by the `appConfig` and `invisible` props.

## Symbols

#### Internal Logic
- The component uses the `cn` function to merge and conditionally apply CSS classes.
- The outer `div` applies padding classes for different screen sizes and print settings.
- The inner `div` applies margin and padding, and adjusts its width based on the `appConfig.width` property.
- If `invisible` is true, the `invisible` class is applied to hide the content.

## References
