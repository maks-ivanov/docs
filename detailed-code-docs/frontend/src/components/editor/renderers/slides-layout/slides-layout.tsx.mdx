## High-level description

The `SlidesLayoutRenderer` component in the `slides-layout.tsx` file is responsible for rendering a series of slides based on cell data in a React application. It utilizes a lazy-loaded `SlidesComponent` to display each cell's output as a slide, adapting its layout based on the application's mode (read or edit). The component ensures that only cells with non-empty outputs are rendered as slides.

## Code Structure

- **SlidesLayoutRenderer**: The main component that orchestrates the rendering of slides.
- **Slide**: A memoized sub-component that renders individual cell outputs using the `OutputArea` component.
- **LazySlidesComponent**: A lazily loaded component that wraps the slides for efficient loading.

## References

- **OutputArea**: A component from `Output.tsx` that handles the rendering of cell outputs.
- **SlidesComponent**: A component from `slides-component.tsx` that provides the slide functionality using the Swiper library.
- **ICellRendererProps**: An interface from `types.ts` that defines the properties passed to cell renderer components.

## Symbols

### `SlidesLayoutRenderer`
#### Description
The `SlidesLayoutRenderer` is a React functional component that renders a series of slides based on the provided cell data. It uses the `SlidesComponent` to display each cell's output as a slide and adapts its layout based on the application's mode (read or edit).

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cells | Array&lt;CellRuntimeState & CellData&gt; | An array of cell data to be rendered as slides. |
| mode | AppMode | The current mode of the application, which affects the layout. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| slides | JSX.Element | A JSX element containing the rendered slides. |

#### Internal Logic
- Determines if the application is in "read" mode.
- Maps over the `cells` array to create individual `Slide` components for each cell with non-empty output.
- Wraps the slides in a `LazySlidesComponent` for efficient loading.
- Adjusts the container's padding based on the mode.

### `Slide`
#### Description
The `Slide` component is a memoized React component that renders the output of a single cell using the `OutputArea` component.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | OutputMessage | The output message of the cell. |
| cellId | CellId | The unique identifier of the cell. |
| status | RuntimeState | The current status of the cell. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| slideContent | JSX.Element | A JSX element containing the rendered output of the cell. |

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if the cell is in a "running" or "queued" state to determine if the output is stale.
- Uses the `OutputArea` component to render the cell's output, passing relevant props like `stale` and `cellId`.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Used for creating React components and hooks. |
| Swiper | Used in `SlidesComponent` for slide functionality. |

## Error Handling

The `SlidesLayoutRenderer` and `Slide` components do not implement specific error handling mechanisms. Errors in rendering are likely managed by React's error boundaries or higher-level components.

## Logging

No explicit logging mechanisms are implemented in the `slides-layout.tsx` file.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
