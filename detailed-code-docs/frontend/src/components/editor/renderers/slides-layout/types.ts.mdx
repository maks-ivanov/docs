## High-level description

The target file defines TypeScript interfaces for a slides layout in a frontend application. These interfaces, `SerializedSlidesLayout` and `SlidesLayout`, are intended to represent the structure of a slides layout, which is used in rendering slides within the application. The interfaces are designed to be backward-compatible, ensuring that serialized data can be stored and retrieved without issues.

## Code Structure

The target file contains two interfaces:
- `SerializedSlidesLayout`: Represents the serialized form of a slides layout.
- `SlidesLayout`: Extends `SerializedSlidesLayout` and is used for the actual layout structure in the application.

These interfaces are used in conjunction with other components and plugins in the application, as seen in the related files.

## Symbols

### `SerializedSlidesLayout`
#### Description
The `SerializedSlidesLayout` interface represents the serialized form of a slides layout. It is designed to be backward-compatible, meaning that any changes to the structure should not break existing serialized data stored on the user's disk.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
Currently, the interface does not define any properties, indicating that the serialized form does not have additional attributes at this time.

### `SlidesLayout`
#### Description
The `SlidesLayout` interface extends `SerializedSlidesLayout` and represents the layout structure used within the application. It is used to define the layout of slides in the editor component.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
Similar to `SerializedSlidesLayout`, this interface does not define any additional properties at the moment.

## References

- The `SlidesLayout` interface is referenced in the `SlidesLayoutPlugin` and `SlidesLayoutRenderer` components in the related files. These components utilize the interface to manage and render slides layouts.

## Dependencies

The target file does not have any external dependencies.

## Error Handling

There is no specific error handling implemented in the target file, as it only defines TypeScript interfaces.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in the target file.

## API/Interface Reference

The target file does not define any API or public interface beyond the TypeScript interfaces.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the target file.
