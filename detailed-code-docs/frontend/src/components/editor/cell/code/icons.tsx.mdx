## High-level description

The target file, `icons.tsx`, defines two React functional components, `PythonIcon` and `MarkdownIcon`, which render SVG icons representing Python and Markdown, respectively. These components are used to visually represent different programming languages or document types within a user interface, particularly in an editor or cell-based environment.

## Code Structure

The file contains two main symbols, `PythonIcon` and `MarkdownIcon`, which are React functional components. Both components utilize the `SVGProps` type from React to allow for customizable SVG properties. These components are used in other parts of the codebase to provide visual cues for Python and Markdown cells or functionalities.

## Symbols

### `PythonIcon`
#### Description
The `PythonIcon` component renders an SVG icon that visually represents the Python programming language. It is designed to be used in a React application, allowing for customization through props.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |

| props | `SVGProps&lt;SVGSVGElement&gt;` | Standard SVG properties to customize the icon's appearance, such as size, color, etc. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | `JSX.Element` | A JSX element representing the Python icon. |

#### Internal Logic
The component returns an SVG element with a predefined path that outlines the shape of the Python logo. It uses the `props` spread operator to allow for additional customization.

### `MarkdownIcon`

The component returns an SVG element with a predefined path that outlines the shape of a Markdown icon. It uses the `props` spread operator to allow for additional customization.

## References

- The `PythonIcon` and `MarkdownIcon` components are referenced in other parts of the codebase, such as in `useCellActionButton.tsx`, `CreateCellButton.tsx`, and `language-toggle.tsx`. These references indicate that the icons are used to represent Python and Markdown cells or functionalities in the user interface.

## Dependencies
