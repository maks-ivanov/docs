## High-level description
The target file is a CSS stylesheet that defines specific styles for elements within a code editor component, likely used in a web-based application. It focuses on styling elements related to a merge editor view, which is typically used for comparing and merging code changes.

## Code Structure
The CSS file contains two main style rules that apply to specific classes within the HTML structure of the application. These rules are likely part of a larger set of styles that define the appearance and behavior of the code editor component.

## Symbols

### `.Cell .cm-mergeViewEditor .cm-editor`
#### Description
This CSS rule targets elements with the class `cm-editor` that are descendants of elements with the classes `Cell` and `cm-mergeViewEditor`. It sets the padding of these elements to zero, which likely ensures that the editor content aligns precisely with its container, without any additional spacing.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `.Cell` | CSS Class | Represents a container or component in the editor. |
| `.cm-mergeViewEditor` | CSS Class | Indicates a specific view within the editor, likely related to code merging. |
| `.cm-editor` | CSS Class | Represents the editor component itself. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | This CSS rule does not produce outputs but affects the layout of the targeted elements. |

### `.cm-merge-theme:last-child`
#### Description
This CSS rule applies to the last child element with the class `cm-merge-theme`. It modifies the overflow behavior and sets border-radius properties to create rounded corners at the bottom of the element. This styling is typically used to enhance the visual appearance of the last section of a merge view, giving it a distinct, polished look.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `.cm-merge-theme` | CSS Class | Represents a theme or style applied to a section of the merge editor. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | This CSS rule does not produce outputs but affects the visual styling of the targeted element. |
