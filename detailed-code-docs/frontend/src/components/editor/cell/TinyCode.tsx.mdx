## High-level description

The `TinyCode.tsx` file defines a React component named `TinyCode` that is used to render a non-editable code editor with syntax highlighting for Python code. It utilizes the CodeMirror library for rendering the code editor and applies a theme based on the current application theme. The component is designed to be lightweight and is styled using a CSS file.

## Code Structure

- The `TinyCode` component is the main symbol in this file. It is a React functional component that uses the `memo` function to optimize rendering.
- The component uses the `useTheme` hook to determine the current theme and applies it to the CodeMirror editor.
- The `cn` utility function is used to merge class names for styling the component.

## Symbols

### `TinyCode`
#### Description
The `TinyCode` component is a React functional component that renders a read-only code editor using the CodeMirror library. It is specifically configured to display Python code with syntax highlighting and is styled to fit within a flexible layout.

#### Inputs
| Name      | Type   | Description                        |
|:----------|:-------|:-----------------------------------|
| `code`    | string | The Python code to be displayed.   |
| `className` | string | Optional additional CSS class names for styling. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| -    | JSX  | The rendered code editor component. |

#### Internal Logic
- The component imports necessary modules and styles, including React, CodeMirror, and a CSS file for styling.
- It defines an array `ext` that configures the CodeMirror editor with Python language support and minimal setup options.
- The `TinyCode` component uses the `useTheme` hook to get the current theme and applies it to the CodeMirror editor.
- The `cn` utility function is used to combine the provided `className` with default class names for styling.
- The component returns a `div` containing the `CodeMirror` component, which is configured to be non-editable and to use the specified extensions and theme.

## References

- The `useTheme` hook from `@/theme/useTheme` is used to determine the current theme.
- The `cn` utility function from `@/utils/cn` is used for class name merging.

## Dependencies

| Dependency                | Purpose                                      |
|:--------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| `React`                   | For creating the React component.            |
| `@uiw/react-codemirror`   | To render the CodeMirror code editor.        |
| `@codemirror/lang-python` | To provide Python syntax highlighting.       |
| `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` | For merging and managing CSS class names.  |

## Configuration

There are no explicit configuration options defined in this file. The component relies on the `useTheme` hook for theme configuration.

## Error Handling

The component does not implement specific error handling mechanisms beyond what is provided by React and the CodeMirror library.

## Logging

There are no logging mechanisms implemented in this code.

## Side Effects

- The component uses the `useTheme` hook, which may trigger re-renders when the theme changes.

## Performance Considerations

- The component is wrapped with `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders when the props do not change, optimizing performance.
