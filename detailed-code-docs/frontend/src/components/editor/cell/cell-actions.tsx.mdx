## High-level description

The `cell-actions.tsx` file defines components for managing and displaying actions related to cells in a user interface, specifically within a dropdown menu. It provides a mechanism to toggle the visibility of a dropdown containing various cell actions and integrates tooltips for user guidance. The file also includes a component for handling cell actions in a connection context, utilizing state management to determine the focus details of a cell.

## Code Structure

The main components in this file are `CellActionsDropdownInternal`, `CellActionsDropdown`, and `ConnectionCellActionsDropdown`. The `CellActionsDropdownInternal` is the core component that manages the dropdown's state and rendering logic. It is wrapped by `CellActionsDropdown` to provide a memoized and forward-ref version. The `ConnectionCellActionsDropdown` component uses the `CellActionsDropdown` and is specifically designed to work with a cell's focus state, leveraging the `jotai` state management library.

## References

- `useCellActionButtons`: A hook that provides the actions available for a cell.
- `useRestoreFocus`: A hook to manage focus restoration when the dropdown is closed.
- `cellFocusDetailsAtom`: An atom from `jotai` that provides focus details for a specific cell.
- `renderMinimalShortcut`: A utility function to render keyboard shortcuts in a minimal format.

## Symbols

### `CellActionsDropdownInternal`
#### Description
This component manages the state and rendering of a dropdown menu for cell actions. It uses a popover to display a list of actions that can be performed on a cell, such as executing a command or toggling a setting.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | React.ReactNode | The content to be rendered inside the popover trigger. |
| showTooltip | boolean | Determines whether a tooltip should be shown. Defaults to true. |
| props | Props | Additional properties extending `CellActionButtonProps`. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| toggle | function | A function to toggle the open state of the dropdown. |

#### Internal Logic
- Manages the open state of the dropdown using `useState`.
- Uses `useImperativeHandle` to expose a `toggle` function to parent components.
- Renders a `PopoverContent` containing a list of actions, each represented by a `CommandItem`.
- Integrates tooltips to provide user guidance when `showTooltip` is true.

### `CellActionsDropdown`
#### Description
A memoized and forward-ref version of `CellActionsDropdownInternal`, providing performance optimizations and ref forwarding capabilities.

### `ConnectionCellActionsDropdown`
#### Description
This component is a specialized version of `CellActionsDropdown` that integrates with the cell's focus state. It uses `jotai` to retrieve the focus details of a cell and conditionally renders the dropdown based on the cell's state.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | React.ReactNode | The content to be rendered inside the dropdown. |
| cellId | CellId | The identifier of the cell for which actions are being managed. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | | |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `useAtomValue` and `useMemo` to retrieve and memoize the focus details of the specified cell.
- Conditionally renders the `CellActionsDropdown` based on the presence of focus details.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
