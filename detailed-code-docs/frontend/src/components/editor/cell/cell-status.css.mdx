## High-level description
The `cell-status.css` file is a CSS stylesheet that defines the visual styling for various status indicators within a cell component of an editor interface. It specifies styles for elements such as status icons, elapsed time displays, and different cell status states like disabled, queued, and stale.

## Code Structure
The CSS file is structured to apply styles to specific classes and IDs that are likely used in the HTML structure of the editor component. The styles are organized by the type of element they apply to, such as icons, text, and different status states.

## Symbols

### `.cell-status-icon`
#### Description
This class is used to style the icon that represents the status of a cell. It adjusts the margins to position the icon appropriately within its container.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | This is a CSS class, so it does not take inputs in the traditional sense. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | This class affects the layout and positioning of HTML elements with the `cell-status-icon` class. |

#### Internal Logic
- Sets `margin-top` to 4px.
- Sets `margin-left` to 3px.
- Sets `margin-bottom` to `auto` to allow for flexible vertical alignment.

### `.elapsed-time`
#### Description
This class styles the text that displays elapsed time, using a monospace font and a specific font size and color.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | This is a CSS class, so it does not take inputs in the traditional sense. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | This class affects the appearance of HTML elements with the `elapsed-time` class. |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses a monospace font defined by a CSS variable `--monospace-font`.
- Sets the font size to 0.8125rem.
- Sets the text color using the CSS variable `--gray-11`.

### `#App.disconnected .elapsed-time`
#### Description
This selector hides the elapsed time display when the application is in a disconnected state.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | This is a CSS selector, so it does not take inputs in the traditional sense. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | This selector affects the visibility of HTML elements with the `elapsed-time` class when the parent `#App` element has the `disconnected` class. |

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the `visibility` property to `hidden`, making the elapsed time text invisible when the application is disconnected.

### `.cell-status-disabled`, `.cell-status-queued`, `.cell-status-stale`
#### Description
These classes apply a specific color to text or icons representing different cell statuses: disabled, queued, and stale.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | These are CSS classes, so they do not take inputs in the traditional sense. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | These classes affect the color of HTML elements with the respective class names. |

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the text color using the CSS variable `--gray-10` for all three status classes.

## Dependencies
The CSS file relies on CSS variables such as `--monospace-font`, `--gray-11`, and `--gray-10` for styling. These variables are likely defined elsewhere in the application's global styles or theme settings.

## Side Effects
- The `#App.disconnected .elapsed-time` selector hides the elapsed time text when the application is disconnected, which is a visual side effect based on the application's state.

## Configuration
The file uses CSS variables for font and color, which allows for easy customization and theming across the application. These variables need to be defined in a global stylesheet or a theme configuration file.
