## High-level description

The `TinyCode.css` file defines CSS styles for a component that uses the CodeMirror editor, specifically targeting a class named `tiny-code`. The styles are designed to create a compact and minimalistic appearance for the code editor, with small font size and specific line height settings.

## Code Structure

The CSS file contains styles that are applied to elements with the class `tiny-code` and its child elements. These styles are used in conjunction with the `TinyCode.tsx` React component, which utilizes the CodeMirror editor to display code snippets.

## References

- The `TinyCode.tsx` file is a React component that imports and applies the styles defined in `TinyCode.css`.
- The `CodeMirror` component from the `@uiw/react-codemirror` library is used in `TinyCode.tsx` to render the code editor.
