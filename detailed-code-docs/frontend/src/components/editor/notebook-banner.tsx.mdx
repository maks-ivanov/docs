## High-level description

The `notebook-banner.tsx` file defines a React component, `NotebookBanner`, which is responsible for displaying notification banners within a notebook interface. These banners can convey various types of messages, such as informational alerts or actions like restarting a session. The component utilizes a state management system to handle the display and removal of these banners, and it includes a button to restart the kernel if needed.

## Code Structure

- **NotebookBanner Component**: The main component that renders a list of banners.
- **RestartSessionButton Component**: A sub-component used within `NotebookBanner` to provide a button for restarting the kernel.
- **State Management**: Utilizes hooks from `useBanners` and `useBannersActions` to manage the state of the banners.

## References

- **useBanners**: A hook to access the current state of banners.
- **useBannersActions**: A hook to perform actions on the banner state, such as removing a banner.
- **renderHTML**: A utility function to safely render HTML content within the banners.
- **useRestartKernel**: A hook that provides functionality to restart the kernel, used in the `RestartSessionButton`.

## Symbols

### `NotebookBanner`
#### Description
The `NotebookBanner` component is responsible for rendering a list of notification banners in a notebook interface. It uses the `useBanners` hook to retrieve the current banners and `useBannersActions` to remove them when necessary.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | React.FC | React functional component properties. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React Element | A list of banners or null if no banners are present. |

#### Internal Logic
- Retrieves the current list of banners using `useBanners`.
- If no banners are present, returns `null`.
- Maps over the banners to render each one using the `Banner` component.
- Includes a button to remove the banner, which calls `removeBanner` from `useBannersActions`.
- If a banner has an action of "restart", it includes a `RestartSessionButton`.

### `RestartSessionButton`
#### Description
The `RestartSessionButton` component provides a button to restart the kernel session. It is used within the `NotebookBanner` when a banner's action is set to "restart".

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React Element | A button element that triggers a kernel restart. |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the `useRestartKernel` hook to get the restart function.
- Renders a button that, when clicked, calls the restart function.
