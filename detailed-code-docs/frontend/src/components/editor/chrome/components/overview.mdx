## High-level description

The directory contains React components designed to enhance user interaction by allowing users to contribute code snippets and provide feedback. The main components are `ContributeSnippetButton` and `FeedbackButton`, each responsible for rendering a button that opens a modal dialog. These modals collect user input and send it to specified API endpoints for processing. The components leverage hooks and UI libraries to manage modal states and provide a seamless user experience.

## What does it do?

The components in this directory provide interactive features for users to engage with the application:

1. **Contribute Snippet Feature**: 
   - Users can click a button to open a modal dialog where they can submit code snippets. 
   - The modal allows users to enter a title, description, and the code itself.
   - Upon submission, the data is sent to an API endpoint for further processing, and a notification is displayed to confirm the submission.

2. **Feedback Collection Feature**:
   - Users can click a button to open a feedback modal.
   - The modal allows users to rate their experience using emojis and provide additional comments.
   - The feedback is sent to an API endpoint, and a notification confirms the submission.

Both features use a "fire-and-forget" approach for API submissions, meaning they do not handle errors or responses from the server. Instead, they focus on collecting user input and providing immediate feedback through toast notifications.

## Entry points

The main files in this directory are `contribute-snippet-button.tsx` and `feedback-button.tsx`. Each file defines a button component that serves as an entry point for its respective feature. The code is organized to separate the button logic from the modal logic, with each button component responsible for opening its corresponding modal.

## Dependencies

The components rely on several external libraries and frameworks:

- **`@radix-ui/react-slot`**: Used for rendering clickable areas in the button components.
- **`@codemirror/view`**: Provides the `EditorView` for the code editor in the snippet contribution modal.
- **`react`**: The core library for building React components.
- **UI Components**: Various UI components from the application's library are used for rendering buttons, inputs, text areas, and dialogs.
- **`@/components/ui/use-toast`**: Provides the `toast` function for displaying notifications.
- **`@/core/constants`**: Supplies constants like URLs for linking to external pages.
- **`@/theme/useTheme`**: Provides the current theme for styling the code editor.

These dependencies are chosen to facilitate the creation of interactive and visually consistent user interfaces, leveraging existing UI components and hooks for state management and theming.
