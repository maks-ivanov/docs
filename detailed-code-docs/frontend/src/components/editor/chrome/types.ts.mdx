## High-level description

The target file, `types.ts`, defines the types and constants used for managing different panels in a user interface, specifically for an editor component. It includes a type definition for panel types, an interface for panel descriptors, and a constant array that describes various panels, including their icons, tooltips, and positions within the UI.

## Code Structure

- **PanelType**: A TypeScript union type that enumerates the possible types of panels that can be displayed in the editor.
- **PanelDescriptor**: An interface that describes the properties of a panel, including its type, icon, visibility, tooltip, and position.
- **PANELS**: An array of `PanelDescriptor` objects, each representing a specific panel with its associated properties.

## Symbols

### `PanelType`
#### Description
`PanelType` is a TypeScript union type that defines the possible types of panels that can be displayed in the editor. It includes options like "files", "errors", "variables", etc.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

### `PanelDescriptor`
#### Description
`PanelDescriptor` is an interface that describes the properties of a panel. It includes the panel type, an icon, an optional hidden flag, a tooltip, and the position of the panel in the UI.

#### Inputs
| Name     | Type       | Description                          |
|:---------|:-----------|:-------------------------------------|
| type     | PanelType  | The type of the panel.               |
| Icon     | LucideIcon | The icon associated with the panel.  |
| hidden   | boolean    | Optional flag to hide the panel.     |
| tooltip  | string     | Tooltip text for the panel.          |
| position | string     | Position of the panel ("sidebar" or "footer"). |

#### Outputs
None

### `PANELS`
#### Description
`PANELS` is a constant array of `PanelDescriptor` objects. Each object in the array represents a specific panel with its type, icon, tooltip, and position. Some panels may be conditionally hidden based on feature flags.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name  | Type             | Description                        |
|:------|:-----------------|:-----------------------------------|
| PANELS | PanelDescriptor[] | Array of panel descriptors. |

#### Internal Logic
- The `hidden` property for the "scratchpad" panel is determined by the `getFeatureFlag` function, which checks if the "scratchpad" feature is enabled.

## References

- **`getFeatureFlag`**: This function is used to determine if certain features, like the "scratchpad", should be enabled or hidden. It is imported from the `feature-flag` module.

## Dependencies

| Dependency   | Purpose                                      |
|:-------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| `lucide-react` | Provides icon components used in the panels. |
| `getFeatureFlag` | Determines feature availability for panels. |
