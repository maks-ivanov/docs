## High-level description

The `sidebar.tsx` file defines a `Sidebar` component for a web application's editor interface. This component is responsible for rendering a vertical sidebar with interactive items that allow users to navigate between different panels of the application. It utilizes a state management system to track the currently selected panel and provides a feedback button for user interaction.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `Sidebar` component and the `SidebarItem` component. The `Sidebar` component uses the `SidebarItem` component to render each item in the sidebar. It also interacts with the application's state through hooks like `useChromeState` and `useChromeActions` to determine which panel is currently selected and to handle user interactions.

## References

- `useChromeState` and `useChromeActions` from `state.ts` are used to manage the state of the sidebar.
- `PanelDescriptor` and `PANELS` from `types.ts` provide the configuration for the sidebar items.
- `Tooltip` from `tooltip.tsx` is used to display tooltips for each sidebar item.
- `cn` from `cn.ts` is used for class name management.

## Symbols

### `Sidebar`
#### Description
The `Sidebar` component renders a vertical sidebar with interactive items that allow users to switch between different panels in the application. It uses the `useChromeState` hook to determine the currently selected panel and the `useChromeActions` hook to handle panel selection changes.

#### Inputs
None directly, but it uses hooks to access application state.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX Element | React Element | The rendered sidebar component. |

#### Internal Logic
- Retrieves the `selectedPanel` from the application state.
- Filters the `PANELS` array to get only the panels that should be displayed in the sidebar.
- Maps over the filtered panels to render a `SidebarItem` for each, passing the appropriate props.
- Includes a `FeedbackButton` with a `SidebarItem` for user feedback.

### `SidebarItem`
#### Description
The `SidebarItem` component represents an individual item in the sidebar. It displays an icon and a tooltip, and it changes appearance based on whether it is selected.

#### Inputs
| Name     | Type                      | Description                        |
|:---------|:--------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| children | ReactNode                 | The icon or content to display.    |
| tooltip  | ReactNode                 | The tooltip content.               |
| selected | boolean                   | Whether the item is selected.      |
| className| string (optional)         | Additional CSS classes.            |
| rest     | React.HTMLAttributes&lt;HTMLDivElement&gt; | Additional HTML attributes. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX Element | React Element | The rendered sidebar item component. |

#### Internal Logic
- Wraps the content in a `Tooltip` component to display the tooltip on hover.
- Uses the `cn` utility to conditionally apply CSS classes based on the `selected` state.
- Renders the children within a styled `div` element.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `lucide-react` | Provides icon components used in the sidebar. |
| `@/utils/cn` | Utility for merging and managing CSS class names. |
| `@/components/ui/tooltip` | Provides the tooltip functionality for sidebar items. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors, as it primarily deals with rendering UI components and relies on React's error boundaries for error management.
