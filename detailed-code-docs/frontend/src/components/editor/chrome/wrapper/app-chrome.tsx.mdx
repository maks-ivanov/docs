## High-level description

The `app-chrome.tsx` file defines the `AppChrome` component, which serves as the main layout and user interface container for a web application. It manages the display and interaction of various panels, such as a sidebar, terminal, and different content panels, using a resizable panel system. The component also handles the synchronization of UI states, such as the visibility of the sidebar and terminal, and provides a structured layout for embedding child components.

## Code Structure

The `AppChrome` component is the central element in this file, orchestrating the layout and interaction of various UI components. It uses several imported components and hooks to manage state and render different parts of the UI, such as the sidebar, terminal, and various panels. The component relies on the `PanelGroup`, `Panel`, and `PanelResizeHandle` from the `react-resizable-panels` library to create a flexible and resizable layout.

## Symbols

### `AppChrome`
#### Description
The `AppChrome` component is a React functional component that provides the main layout for the application. It manages the display of a sidebar, terminal, and various content panels, allowing users to interact with different parts of the application through a resizable interface.

#### Inputs
| Name     | Type             | Description                  |
|:---------|:-----------------|:-----------------------------|
| children | `React.ReactNode` | The content to be displayed within the main application panel. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | N/A  | The component does not return any outputs directly. It renders UI elements. |

#### Internal Logic
- **State Management**: Uses `useChromeState` and `useChromeActions` hooks to manage the state of the sidebar and terminal (open/closed status).
- **Effect Hooks**: Utilizes `useEffect` to synchronize the UI state with the actual display state of the sidebar and terminal, ensuring they expand or collapse based on the current state.
- **Panel Layout**: Constructs a layout using `PanelGroup` and `Panel` components, allowing for a resizable and collapsible interface. The layout includes a sidebar, a main application panel, and a terminal panel.
- **Event Handling**: Handles resize events to ensure UI components adjust correctly when panels are resized or toggled.

## References

- **`useChromeState` and `useChromeActions`**: These hooks are imported from the `state` module and are used to access and manipulate the state related to the sidebar and terminal.
- **`PanelGroup`, `Panel`, `PanelResizeHandle`**: Components from the `react-resizable-panels` library used to create a flexible and resizable layout.
- **`ErrorBoundary`**: A component used to catch and display errors within the UI panels.
- **Various Panel Components**: Such as `ErrorsPanel`, `OutlinePanel`, `DependencyGraphPanel`, etc., which are conditionally rendered based on the selected panel state.

|:--------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `react-resizable-panels`  | Provides components for creating resizable and collapsible panel layouts. |
| `lucide-react`            | Supplies icon components used throughout the UI.                         |
| `@/utils/cn`              | Utility function for merging and managing class names.                   |

## Error Handling

- **ErrorBoundary**: The `ErrorBoundary` component is used to wrap certain parts of the UI, such as the help pane body, to catch and display errors gracefully without crashing the entire application.

## Logging

- The code does not implement specific logging mechanisms within this file. However, it dispatches resize events which can be useful for debugging UI layout issues.

## API/Interface Reference

The `AppChrome` component does not expose an API or interface directly. It serves as a container for other components and manages their layout and state.

## TODOs

- There are no explicit TODOs or notes left in the code.
