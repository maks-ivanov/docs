## High-level description

The directory contains various components and utilities for managing the user interface of a web-based editor application. It includes components for the main application layout, sidebar, footer, and machine statistics, as well as utilities for managing panel storage and styles for UI elements. The components are designed to provide a flexible and interactive user interface, allowing users to navigate between different panels, view system statistics, and manage application state.

## What does it do?

The codebase provides a comprehensive user interface for a web-based editor application. It includes:

- **AppChrome Component**: This is the main layout component that organizes the user interface into resizable panels, including a sidebar, main content area, and terminal. It allows users to interact with different parts of the application through a flexible and resizable interface.

- **Sidebar Component**: A vertical navigation bar that allows users to switch between different panels of the application. It provides interactive items with tooltips for easy navigation.

- **Footer Component**: Displays interactive elements for managing application state, such as toggling terminal visibility, handling error notifications, and configuring runtime settings. It also shows machine statistics and a kiosk mode indicator.

- **MachineStats Component**: Displays real-time statistics about the machine's memory and CPU usage, as well as the status of a WebSocket connection. It updates periodically to provide current system information.

- **Storage Utility**: Manages the storage of panel states, adapting to the panel's location to ensure consistent UI behavior. It provides methods to store and retrieve panel state data, flipping the order of stored values when necessary.

- **CSS Styles**: Defines styles for resize handles used in the user interface, specifying their appearance and behavior, including size, transition effects, and hover states.

Overall, the codebase provides a structured and interactive user interface for a web-based editor, allowing users to manage and interact with different parts of the application efficiently.
