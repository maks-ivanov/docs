## High-level description

The `VariablePanel` component in the target file is a React functional component that displays a panel for managing and viewing global variables within an application. It utilizes hooks to retrieve the current state of variables and cell IDs, and conditionally renders either a table of variables or an empty state message if no variables are present.

## Code Structure

The `VariablePanel` component is the main symbol in the code. It interacts with several other components and hooks:
- `useVariables` and `useCellIds` hooks are used to fetch the current state of variables and cell IDs.
- `VariableTable` is used to display the variables in a tabular format.
- `PanelEmptyState` is used to display a message when there are no variables to show.
- `FunctionSquareIcon` is used as an icon in the empty state message.

## References

- `useVariables` and `useCellIds` are hooks from the application's core state management system, providing access to the current variables and cell IDs.
- `VariableTable` is a component that renders a table of variables.
- `PanelEmptyState` is a component that displays a message when there are no variables.
- `FunctionSquareIcon` is an icon from the `lucide-react` library.

## Symbols

### `VariablePanel`
#### Description
The `VariablePanel` component is responsible for displaying a panel that shows global variables in a table format. If no variables are present, it displays an empty state message with an icon and description.

#### Inputs
None directly, but it uses hooks to fetch:
- Variables from the `useVariables` hook.
- Cell IDs from the `useCellIds` hook.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React Element | The rendered panel, either showing a table of variables or an empty state message. |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component calls `useVariables` to get the current state of variables.
2. It calls `useCellIds` to get the current cell IDs.
3. It checks if there are any variables:
   - If there are no variables, it returns a `PanelEmptyState` component with a title, description, and icon.
   - If variables exist, it returns a `VariableTable` component, passing the variables and cell IDs to it.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `lucide-react` | Provides the `FunctionSquareIcon` used in the empty state. |

## Error Handling

The component does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the hooks `useVariables` and `useCellIds` will provide valid data or an empty object/array.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in this component.

## API/Interface Reference

The `VariablePanel` component does not expose any API or interface directly. It is a part of the application's UI and interacts with the state management system through hooks.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
