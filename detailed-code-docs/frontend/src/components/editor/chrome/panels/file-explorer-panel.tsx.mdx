## High-level description

The `file-explorer-panel.tsx` file defines a React component named `FileExplorerPanel`. This component is responsible for rendering a file explorer interface within a panel, allowing users to view and interact with a file tree. It includes features such as drag-and-drop file uploads and dynamic resizing of the file explorer view.

## Code Structure

The `FileExplorerPanel` component is the main symbol in this file. It utilizes several hooks and components to achieve its functionality:
- `useResizeObserver` is used to dynamically adjust the height of the file explorer based on the panel's size.
- `useFileExplorerUpload` provides drag-and-drop file upload capabilities.
- `FileExplorer` is a child component that renders the actual file tree and handles file interactions.

## Symbols

### `FileExplorerPanel`
#### Description
The `FileExplorerPanel` component is a React functional component that renders a file explorer interface. It integrates file upload capabilities and dynamically adjusts its layout based on the panel's size.

#### Inputs
None directly, but it uses hooks that internally manage state and DOM references.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX Element | React Element | The rendered file explorer panel with upload and resize functionalities. |

#### Internal Logic
- The component uses `useResizeObserver` to monitor changes in the panel's size and adjust the file explorer's height accordingly.
- It uses `useFileExplorerUpload` to handle file uploads via drag-and-drop, with options to disable click and keyboard interactions for uploads.
- The component conditionally renders a drop zone overlay when files are being dragged over the panel.
- It renders the `FileExplorer` component, passing the dynamically calculated height to it.

## References

- `useResizeObserver` from the `use-resize-observer` library is used to observe changes in the panel's size.
- `useFileExplorerUpload` is a custom hook from the `file-tree/upload` module that manages file upload interactions.
- `FileExplorer` is a component from the `file-tree/file-explorer` module that displays the file tree and handles file operations.
- `cn` is a utility function from `@/utils/cn` used for conditional class name merging.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `React` | Used for creating the React component. |
| `use-resize-observer` | Observes changes in the size of the panel to adjust the file explorer's height. |
| `@/utils/cn` | Utility for merging class names conditionally. |

## Error Handling

The component does not explicitly handle errors within its logic. Error handling, if needed, would likely be managed by the hooks or child components it uses.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in this component.

## API/Interface Reference

The `FileExplorerPanel` does not expose any API or public interface directly. It is a part of the UI and interacts with users through the browser interface.
