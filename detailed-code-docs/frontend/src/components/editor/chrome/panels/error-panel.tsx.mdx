## High-level description

The `ErrorsPanel` component in the target file is a React functional component designed to display a list of errors associated with cells in a notebook-like application. It utilizes the `useCellErrors` hook to retrieve errors and conditionally renders either a list of errors or a message indicating no errors are present. The component is part of a larger system that manages and displays the state of cells, including their errors, within a user interface.

## Code Structure

The `ErrorsPanel` component is the main symbol in the code. It interacts with several other components and hooks:
- `useCellErrors`: A hook that provides the list of errors for the cells.
- `MarimoErrorOutput`: A component used to display detailed error information.
- `CellLinkError`: A component that provides a link to the cell associated with an error.
- `PanelEmptyState`: A component that displays a message when there are no errors.
- `PartyPopperIcon`: An icon used in the empty state message.

## Symbols

### `ErrorsPanel`
#### Description
The `ErrorsPanel` component is responsible for displaying errors related to cells in a notebook. It retrieves errors using the `useCellErrors` hook and renders them using the `MarimoErrorOutput` component. If no errors are present, it displays a message indicating that there are no errors.

#### Inputs
None directly, but it uses the `useCellErrors` hook to fetch data.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React Element | The rendered output of the component, which includes either a list of errors or an empty state message. |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component calls `useCellErrors` to get the list of errors.
2. It checks if the `errors` array is empty.
   - If empty, it returns a `PanelEmptyState` component with a "No errors!" message and a `PartyPopperIcon`.
   - If not empty, it maps over the `errors` array and renders each error using a combination of `CellLinkError` and `MarimoErrorOutput` components.

## Error Handling

The component does not implement specific error handling mechanisms beyond checking if the `errors` array is empty. It relies on the `useCellErrors` hook to provide accurate data.

## Logging

The component does not implement any logging mechanisms.
