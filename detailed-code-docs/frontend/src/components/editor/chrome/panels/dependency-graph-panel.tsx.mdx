## High-level description

The `DependencyGraphPanel` component in the target file is a React functional component that serves as a panel for displaying a dependency graph within a user interface. It utilizes data from cells and variables to render a `DependencyGraph` component, which visually represents dependencies between different elements in a notebook-like environment.

## Code Structure

The `DependencyGraphPanel` component is the main symbol in the code. It imports several hooks and components to gather necessary data and render the `DependencyGraph`. The `DependencyGraph` component, defined in a related file, is responsible for the actual rendering of the graph using the provided data.

## Symbols

### `DependencyGraphPanel`
#### Description
The `DependencyGraphPanel` is a React functional component that renders a panel containing a dependency graph. It collects data about cells and variables using custom hooks and passes this data to the `DependencyGraph` component for visualization.

#### Inputs
None directly, but it uses hooks to gather data.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX Element | React Element | A div containing the `DependencyGraph` component. |

#### Internal Logic
- The component uses the `useVariables` hook to retrieve the current state of variables.
- It uses the `useCellIds` hook to get the ordered list of cell IDs.
- The `useCellDataAtoms` hook is used to get the data for each cell.
- It then renders a `div` with specific styling classes, which contains the `DependencyGraph` component.
- The `DependencyGraph` component is provided with `cellAtoms`, `variables`, and `cellIds` as props.

## References

- **`useVariables`**: A hook from `@/core/variables/state` that provides the current state of variables.
- **`useCellIds`**: A hook from `@/core/cells/cells` that provides the ordered list of cell IDs.
- **`useCellDataAtoms`**: A hook from `@/core/cells/cells` that provides the data for each cell.
- **`DependencyGraph`**: A component from `../../../dependency-graph/dependency-graph` that renders the actual graph.
- **`cn`**: A utility function from `@/utils/cn` used to merge and apply CSS class names.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `React` | Used for creating the React component. |
| `@/core/cells/cells` | Provides hooks for accessing cell data and IDs. |
| `@/core/variables/state` | Provides a hook for accessing variable data. |
| `../../../dependency-graph/dependency-graph` | Contains the `DependencyGraph` component for rendering the graph. |
| `@/utils/cn` | Utility for merging CSS class names. |

## Error Handling
The component does not implement specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on the assumption that the hooks and components it uses will handle errors appropriately.

## Logging
There is no explicit logging implemented in this component.

## API/Interface Reference
The component does not expose an API or public interface directly. It is used as part of a larger application interface, likely within a panel system as seen in the related `app-chrome.tsx` file.
