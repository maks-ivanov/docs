## High-level description
The target file is a CSS stylesheet that defines styles for a component called `snippet-viewer`. It specifically styles `h1` and `h2` headers within this component, applying text alignment and font styling using Tailwind CSS utility classes.

## Code Structure
The CSS file uses nested styling to apply specific styles to `h1` and `h2` elements within the `.snippet-viewer` class. It leverages Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive to incorporate utility classes for styling.

## Symbols

### `.snippet-viewer`
#### Description
The `.snippet-viewer` class is a CSS class that targets a specific component or section within the application, likely related to displaying code snippets or similar content. It contains nested styles for `h1` and `h2` elements.

#### Internal Logic
- **`h1` styling**: 
  - Aligns text to the left.
  - Applies Tailwind CSS classes `text-base` for base text size and `font-bold` for bold font weight.
  
- **`h2` styling**: 
  - Applies Tailwind CSS classes `text-sm` for small text size and `font-bold` for bold font weight.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Tailwind CSS | Utilized for applying utility-first CSS classes to style elements. |

## Performance Considerations
Using Tailwind CSS's utility classes can lead to more efficient styling by reducing the need for custom CSS, which can improve maintainability and potentially reduce CSS file size.

## Error Handling

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
