## High-level description

The directory contains a collection of React components that form part of a notebook editor's user interface. These components are organized into panels, each serving a specific purpose within the editor. The panels include functionalities for managing data sources, visualizing dependency graphs, displaying documentation, handling errors, exploring files, viewing logs, navigating outlines, using a scratchpad, managing code snippets, and managing variables. Each panel is designed to provide a specific feature or set of features to enhance the user's interaction with the notebook editor.

## What does it do?

The codebase provides a comprehensive set of panels that enhance the functionality of a notebook editor. Here's a breakdown of what each panel does:

- **DataSourcesPanel**: Allows users to browse and interact with data tables and columns, facilitating the addition of these elements to a notebook and previewing column data.

- **DependencyGraphPanel**: Displays a visual representation of dependencies between different elements in the notebook, helping users understand the relationships and data flow.

- **DocumentationPanel**: Shows documentation related to symbols in the code editor, providing users with contextual information and guidance.

- **ErrorsPanel**: Lists errors associated with cells in the notebook, allowing users to identify and address issues within their code.

- **FileExplorerPanel**: Offers a file explorer interface for viewing and interacting with a file tree, including drag-and-drop file uploads.

- **LogsPanel**: Displays logs related to cell operations, categorized by source and timestamped for clarity, with options to clear logs.

- **OutlinePanel**: Provides an outline of the notebook's content, allowing users to navigate through different sections easily.

- **ScratchpadPanel**: Renders a scratchpad for code editing and execution, offering a space for users to experiment with code snippets.

- **SnippetsPanel**: Displays a list of code snippets, enabling users to search, view details, and insert snippets into the editor.

- **VariablePanel**: Manages and displays global variables, showing them in a table format or indicating when no variables are present.

Each panel is designed to integrate seamlessly into the notebook editor, providing users with a rich set of tools to enhance their coding and data analysis experience.
