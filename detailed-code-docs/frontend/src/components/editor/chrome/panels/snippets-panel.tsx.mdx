## High-level description

The `snippets-panel.tsx` file defines a React component called `SnippetsPanel` that is part of a larger editor interface. This component is responsible for displaying a list of code snippets, allowing users to search through them, view their details, and insert them into an editor. It also provides functionality for users to contribute new snippets.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are interconnected as follows:
- `SnippetsPanel` is the main component that manages the state and rendering of the snippets list and the selected snippet's details.
- `SnippetList` is a sub-component used within `SnippetsPanel` to render the list of available snippets.
- `SnippetViewer` is another sub-component used to display the details of a selected snippet.
- The component uses several hooks and utility functions such as `useAsyncData`, `useTheme`, and `useLastFocusedCellId` to manage data fetching, theming, and focus state.

## Symbols

### `SnippetsPanel`
#### Description
The `SnippetsPanel` component is responsible for fetching and displaying a list of code snippets. It allows users to search for snippets, view their details, and insert them into an editor. It also handles error and loading states during data fetching.

#### Inputs
None directly, but it uses hooks to manage state and data.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX Element | React Element | The rendered UI of the snippets panel. |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `useAsyncData` to fetch snippets from the server.
- Manages the state of the selected snippet using `useState`.
- Renders a search input, a list of snippets, and a viewer for the selected snippet.
- Handles error and loading states by displaying an `ErrorBanner` or `Spinner`.

### `SnippetList`
#### Description
`SnippetList` is a component that renders a list of snippets and allows the user to select one.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| snippets | Snippet[] | An array of snippet objects to display. |
| onSelect | function | Callback function to handle snippet selection. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX Element | React Element | The rendered list of snippets. |

### `SnippetViewer`
#### Description
`SnippetViewer` displays the details of a selected snippet, including its title and sections. It allows users to insert the snippet or its code sections into the editor.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| snippet | Snippet | The snippet object to display. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX Element | React Element | The rendered details of the selected snippet. |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `useTheme` to apply the current theme to the code editor.
- Provides buttons to insert the entire snippet or individual code sections into the editor.
- Renders HTML content using `renderHTML` and code sections using `LazyAnyLanguageCodeMirror`.
