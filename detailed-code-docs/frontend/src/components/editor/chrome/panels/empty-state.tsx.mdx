## High-level description

The target file defines a React component named `PanelEmptyState` that is used to display a consistent empty state message across various panels in a user interface. This component is designed to show a title, an optional description, and an optional icon, with customizable color settings.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in the code is the `PanelEmptyState` component, which is a functional React component. It takes a set of properties (`Props`) and renders a styled message indicating an empty state. The component is used in various other files to provide a consistent user experience when there is no data to display in a panel.

## Symbols

### `PanelEmptyState`
#### Description
The `PanelEmptyState` component is a reusable React component that displays a message indicating an empty state in a panel. It is designed to be flexible, allowing for a title, optional description, optional icon, and optional color customization.

#### Inputs
| Name        | Type                | Description                                      |
|:------------|:--------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| title       | string              | The main title text to display in the empty state. |
| description | React.ReactNode     | An optional description providing more details.   |
| color       | string              | An optional color to customize the appearance.    |
| icon        | React.ReactElement  | An optional icon to display alongside the title.  |

#### Outputs
The component does not return any outputs in the traditional sense, as it is a UI component. It renders a JSX element that represents the empty state message.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses a simple structure to render its content:
1. It wraps the content in a `div` with specific margin and flex properties for layout.
2. If an `icon` is provided, it clones the icon element and applies a class for styling.
3. It displays the `title` in a styled `span`.
4. If a `description` is provided, it is displayed in another `span` with muted styling.
