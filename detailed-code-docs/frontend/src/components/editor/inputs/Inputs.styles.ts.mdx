## High-level description

The target file `Inputs.styles.ts` defines style configurations for button and input components in a frontend application using the `class-variance-authority` (CVA) library. It provides a structured way to apply different styles based on variants such as color, shape, and size, allowing for consistent and flexible styling of UI components.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `button` and `input` style configurations, both created using the `cva` function. The `button` configuration includes multiple variants and compound variants to handle different styling needs based on color, shape, and size. The `input` configuration defines a single style setup for input fields.

## Symbols

### `button`
#### Description
The `button` symbol defines a set of styles for button components, allowing for customization through variants such as color, shape, and size. It uses the `cva` function to manage these styles and apply them conditionally based on the specified variants.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| color | string | Determines the color scheme of the button (e.g., gray, white, green, red, yellow, hint-green, disabled). |
| shape | string | Defines the shape of the button (e.g., rectangle, circle). |
| size | string | Specifies the size of the button (e.g., small, medium). |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| className | string | A string of class names that apply the specified styles to a button component. |

#### Internal Logic
- **Variants**: The `button` symbol uses variants to define different styles based on color, shape, and size. Each variant corresponds to a specific set of CSS classes.
- **Compound Variants**: These are combinations of the basic variants that apply additional styles when certain conditions are met (e.g., a small circular button).
- **Default Variants**: If no specific variant is provided, default styles are applied (gray color, medium size, rectangle shape).

### `input`
#### Description
The `input` symbol defines a style configuration for input components, focusing on a consistent appearance with a mono font, full width, and specific hover and focus effects.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | N/A | The `input` style does not take any specific input parameters. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| className | string | A string of class names that apply the specified styles to an input component. |

#### Internal Logic
- The `input` style is defined with a set of CSS classes that ensure a consistent look and feel, including font, size, and hover/focus effects.
