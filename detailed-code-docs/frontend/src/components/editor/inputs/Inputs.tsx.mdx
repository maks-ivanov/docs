## High-level description

The `Inputs.tsx` file defines two React components, `Button` and `Input`, which are customizable UI elements used throughout the application. These components leverage the `class-variance-authority` for styling and support forwarding refs, allowing them to be used flexibly in various contexts within the application.

## Code Structure

The file contains two main components: `Button` and `Input`. Both components are built using React's `forwardRef` to allow parent components to access the underlying DOM elements. The `Button` component is styled using properties like `color`, `shape`, and `size`, which are defined in an external styles module. The `Input` component is a simple wrapper around the HTML input element, also supporting class-based styling.

### `Button`
#### Description
The `Button` component is a customizable button element that supports various styles and attributes. It uses the `class-variance-authority` to apply styles based on the `color`, `shape`, and `size` properties, and it forwards a ref to the underlying HTML button element.

#### Inputs
| Name      | Type                                      | Description                                      |
|:----------|:------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| color     | string                                    | The color variant of the button.                 |
| shape     | string                                    | The shape of the button (e.g., circle, rectangle).|
| size      | string                                    | The size of the button (e.g., small, medium).    |
| className | string                                    | Additional CSS classes to apply to the button.   |
| props     | React.ButtonHTMLAttributes&lt;HTMLButtonElement&gt; | Additional HTML attributes for the button.       |
| ref       | React.Ref&lt;HTMLButtonElement&gt;              | Ref forwarded to the button element.             |

#### Outputs
| Name     | Type                  | Description                  |
|:---------|:----------------------|:-----------------------------|
| children | React.ReactNode       | The content inside the button.|

#### Internal Logic
The `Button` component uses the `clsx` library to combine the styles from `styles.button` with any additional classes provided via `className`. It spreads any additional props onto the button element, allowing for flexible usage.

### `Input`
#### Description
The `Input` component is a simple wrapper around the HTML input element, designed to support additional styling through class names. It forwards a ref to the underlying input element.

#### Inputs
| Name      | Type                                      | Description                                      |
|:----------|:------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| className | string                                    | Additional CSS classes to apply to the input.    |
| props     | React.HtmlHTMLAttributes&lt;HTMLInputElement&gt; | Additional HTML attributes for the input.        |
| ref       | React.Ref&lt;HTMLInputElement&gt;               | Ref forwarded to the input element.              |

#### Outputs
| Name     | Type                  | Description                  |
|:---------|:----------------------|:-----------------------------|
| children | React.ReactNode       | The content inside the input.|

#### Internal Logic
The `Input` component uses the `clsx` library to combine the styles from `styles.input` with any additional classes provided via `className`. It spreads any additional props onto the input element, allowing for flexible usage.

## References

- `styles.button` and `styles.input`: These are style definitions imported from `Inputs.styles`, which define the visual appearance of the `Button` and `Input` components.
- `clsx`: A utility for conditionally joining class names together, used to apply styles dynamically.

## Error Handling

The components do not implement specific error handling mechanisms beyond what is provided by React and TypeScript for type checking and prop validation.

## Logging

There are no logging mechanisms implemented in this code.

## API/Interface Reference

The `Button` and `Input` components do not expose an API beyond their props and ref forwarding capabilities. They are designed to be used as part of the application's UI layer.
