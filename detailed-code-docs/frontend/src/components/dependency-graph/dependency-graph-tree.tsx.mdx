## High-level description

The `DependencyGraphTree` component is a React component that visualizes the dependencies between different cells in a graph format using the ReactFlow library. It constructs a graph layout based on the provided cell data, variables, and settings, and allows users to interact with the graph by selecting nodes and edges, as well as highlighting specific cells.

## Code Structure

The `DependencyGraphTree` component relies on several interconnected symbols and utilities to function:

- **TreeElementsBuilder**: Responsible for creating the nodes and edges of the graph based on the cell data and variables.
- **layoutElements**: A utility function that arranges the nodes and edges in a specified layout direction.
- **useNodesState and useEdgesState**: Hooks from ReactFlow to manage the state of nodes and edges.
- **useFitToViewOnDimensionChange**: A custom hook to adjust the view when the graph's dimensions change.
- **GraphSelectionPanel**: A component that displays information about the currently selected node or edge.

## References

- **ReactFlow**: A library used for rendering and managing the graph.
- **Jotai**: A state management library used for managing cell data.
- **Dagre.js**: Used for graph layout calculations.

## Symbols

### `DependencyGraphTree`
#### Description
The `DependencyGraphTree` component renders a dependency graph of cells using ReactFlow. It manages the creation and layout of graph elements (nodes and edges) and provides interaction capabilities such as node and edge selection and cell highlighting.

#### Inputs
| Name            | Type                | Description                                      |
|:----------------|:--------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| cellIds         | `CellId[]`          | Array of cell identifiers.                       |
| variables       | `Variables`         | Object containing variable information.          |
| cellAtoms       | `Array&lt;Atom&lt;CellData&gt;&gt;` | Array of Jotai atoms representing cell data. |
| layoutDirection | `LayoutDirection`   | Direction for graph layout (e.g., "TB", "LR").   |
| settings        | `GraphSettings`     | Configuration settings for the graph.            |
| children        | `React.ReactNode`   | Optional children to render within the graph.    |

#### Outputs
The component does not explicitly return outputs but renders a visual graph and updates its state based on user interactions.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Element Creation**: Uses `TreeElementsBuilder` to create nodes and edges based on the provided cell data and variables.
2. **Layout**: Applies the `layoutElements` function to arrange the nodes and edges according to the specified layout direction.
3. **State Management**: Utilizes `useNodesState` and `useEdgesState` to manage the state of nodes and edges.
4. **Event Handling**: Handles node and edge clicks to update the selection state and highlights cells on double-click.
5. **View Adjustment**: Uses `useFitToViewOnDimensionChange` to adjust the view when the graph's dimensions change.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose                                      |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------------|
| ReactFlow  | For rendering and managing the graph layout. |
| Jotai      | For managing state related to cell data.     |
| Dagre.js   | For calculating graph layouts.               |

## Error Handling

The component does not explicitly handle errors beyond basic React error boundaries. It assumes that the provided data (cellIds, variables, etc.) is valid and correctly formatted.

## Logging

The component does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The component does not expose an API or public interface beyond its React props.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
