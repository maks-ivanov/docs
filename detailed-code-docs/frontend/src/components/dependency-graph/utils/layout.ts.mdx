## High-level description

The target file, `layout.ts`, is responsible for arranging nodes and edges in a dependency graph using the Dagre library. It defines a function `layoutElements` that takes nodes, edges, and layout options as input, and returns the nodes with updated positions based on the specified layout direction.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in this file is the `layoutElements` function, which utilizes the Dagre library's graph and layout functionalities to compute the positions of nodes in a graph. The function interacts with the `graphlib` and `layout` modules from the `@dagrejs/dagre` package to set up the graph and perform the layout computation.

## Symbols

### `layoutElements`
#### Description
The `layoutElements` function is designed to compute the layout of a graph's nodes and edges. It uses the Dagre library to determine the positions of nodes based on the specified layout direction and spacing options. The function returns the nodes with updated positions and the original edges.

#### Inputs
| Name    | Type   | Description                                      |
|:--------|:-------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| nodes   | Node[] | An array of nodes to be laid out in the graph.   |
| edges   | Edge[] | An array of edges connecting the nodes.          |
| options | object | An object containing layout options, including the direction of the layout. |

#### Outputs
| Name  | Type   | Description                                      |
|:------|:-------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| nodes | object | An object containing nodes with updated positions and the original edges. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Graph Initialization**: A new graph is created using `graphlib.Graph()` and default edge labels are set to empty objects.
2. **Graph Configuration**: The graph is configured with layout options such as `rankdir` (direction), `nodesep` (node separation), `ranksep` (rank separation), and `ranker` (algorithm for ranking nodes).
3. **Edge and Node Setup**: Edges are added to the graph using `setEdge`, and nodes are added using `setNode`, with default width and height if not provided.
4. **Layout Computation**: The `layout` function from Dagre is called to compute the positions of the nodes.
5. **Result Construction**: The function returns an object containing the nodes with updated positions and the original edges.

## References

- The `layoutElements` function is used in the `DependencyGraphTree` component in `dependency-graph-tree.tsx`, where it is called to layout the graph elements based on the current state and configuration.

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the inputs are valid and that the Dagre library functions will execute without issues. Any errors would likely propagate as exceptions from the Dagre library.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in this code. Any issues would need to be debugged using external tools or by adding logging statements.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
