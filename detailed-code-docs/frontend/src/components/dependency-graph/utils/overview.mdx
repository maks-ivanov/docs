## High-level description

The directory contains utility functions and hooks for managing and visualizing dependency graphs in a React application. These utilities are designed to work with the `reactflow` library, which is used for rendering and interacting with flow diagrams. The main components within this directory include functions for detecting changes in graph states, arranging graph layouts, and adjusting graph views based on window size changes.

## What does it do?

The utilities in this directory facilitate the dynamic and efficient management of dependency graphs. They provide the following functionalities:

1. **Change Detection**: The utilities can detect changes between two states of a graph, identifying which nodes and edges have been added or removed. This is crucial for updating the visual representation of the graph without re-rendering the entire structure, thus improving performance and user experience.

2. **Graph Layout**: The utilities can automatically arrange nodes and edges in a graph using the Dagre library. This ensures that the graph is displayed in a clear and organized manner, making it easier for users to understand the relationships and dependencies between different components.

3. **Responsive View Adjustment**: A custom React hook is provided to automatically adjust the graph's view when the window size changes. This ensures that the graph remains fully visible and optimally scaled, regardless of the user's screen size or window dimensions.

These utilities work together to provide a seamless and interactive experience for users interacting with dependency graphs in a web application. They handle the complexities of graph management, allowing developers to focus on higher-level application logic.
