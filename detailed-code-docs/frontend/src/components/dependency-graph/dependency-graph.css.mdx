## High-level description
The target file is a CSS stylesheet that defines styles for a component related to a dependency graph in a React application. It customizes the appearance and behavior of elements within the `react-flow` library, which is likely used for rendering flow diagrams or graphs.

## Code Structure
The CSS file contains style rules for specific classes used by the `react-flow` library. Each rule targets a specific class and applies styles to modify the cursor behavior, border appearance, and positioning of controls.

## Symbols

### `.react-flow__pane.react-flow__pane`
#### Description
This CSS rule targets elements with the class `react-flow__pane` and sets the cursor to `default`. This indicates that the cursor will appear as the standard arrow pointer when hovering over these elements.

#### Inputs

#### Outputs

| Cursor | CSS Property | Sets the cursor to `default` for the targeted elements. |

### `.react-flow__node.react-flow__node`
#### Description
This CSS rule targets elements with the class `react-flow__node` and sets the cursor to `pointer`. This indicates that the cursor will change to a hand icon, suggesting that the element is interactive or clickable.

#### Inputs

### `.react-flow__handle.react-flow__handle`
#### Description
This CSS rule targets elements with the class `react-flow__handle` and applies a border style using a utility class `border-background`. This likely uses a CSS preprocessor or framework like Tailwind CSS to apply predefined styles.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|

#### Outputs

#### Description
This CSS rule targets elements with the class `react-flow__controls` and positions them 8 pixels from the bottom of their container.

#### Inputs
