## High-level description

The `frontend/src/components/dependency-graph` directory is a part of a React application that visualizes dependencies between different cells or components, likely in a notebook or similar environment. This directory contains components and utilities for rendering and interacting with dependency graphs using the `reactflow` library. The main components include custom nodes, a minimap view, a tree view, and panels for user interaction. The directory also includes utility functions for managing graph layouts and states, as well as TypeScript types for defining graph-related data structures.

## What does it do?

The components and utilities in this directory work together to provide a dynamic and interactive visualization of dependencies between cells. Here's how they function:

1. **Custom Node Rendering**: The `CustomNode` component is used to render individual nodes within the graph. It is highly customizable, allowing for dynamic sizing and styling based on its properties and context. This component uses the `reactflow` library to define connection points and manage node interactions.

2. **Graph Views**: The `DependencyGraph` component offers two main views for visualizing the graph: a minimap view (`DependencyGraphMinimap`) and a tree view (`DependencyGraphTree`). These views allow users to explore the relationships between different elements in a structured manner. The minimap provides an overview, while the tree view offers a more detailed layout.

3. **User Interaction Panels**: The `GraphToolbar` and `GraphSelectionPanel` components provide user interfaces for interacting with the graph. The toolbar allows users to change the graph's layout and settings, while the selection panel displays details about selected nodes or edges.

4. **Graph Layout and State Management**: The `elements.ts` file defines classes for creating nodes and edges in different layouts, such as vertical and tree layouts. These classes use the `reactflow` library to structure the graph elements and handle different configurations for displaying the graph.

5. **Utility Functions**: The utilities in the `utils` directory facilitate change detection, graph layout arrangement, and responsive view adjustment. These functions ensure that the graph is displayed clearly and efficiently, adapting to changes in data and window size.

Overall, this directory provides a comprehensive solution for visualizing and interacting with dependency graphs in a web application, leveraging the `reactflow` library for rendering and state management.
