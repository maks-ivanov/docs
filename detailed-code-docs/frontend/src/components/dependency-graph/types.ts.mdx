## High-level description

The target file `types.ts` defines TypeScript types and interfaces used in a dependency graph component within a frontend application. These types are primarily used to manage the layout, selection, and settings of the graph, which visualizes dependencies between different cells or nodes.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are interconnected as follows:
- `LayoutDirection` and `GraphLayoutView` define the possible orientations and views for the graph layout.
- `GraphSelection` is a union type that represents the selection state of the graph, which can be a node, an edge, or undefined.
- `GraphSettings` is an interface that specifies configuration options for the graph, such as whether to hide pure markdown nodes.

## Symbols

### `LayoutDirection`
#### Description
`LayoutDirection` is a type alias that defines the possible directions for laying out the graph. It can either be "TB" (top-to-bottom) or "LR" (left-to-right).

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

### `GraphLayoutView`
#### Description
`GraphLayoutView` extends `LayoutDirection` by adding an additional option "_minimap_", which represents a minimap view of the graph.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

### `GraphSelection`
#### Description
`GraphSelection` is a union type that represents the current selection in the graph. It can be a node, an edge, or undefined. If it's a node, it includes the node's `CellId`. If it's an edge, it includes the `source` and `target` `CellId`s.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

### `GraphSettings`
#### Description
`GraphSettings` is an interface that defines settings for the graph. Currently, it includes a single boolean property `hidePureMarkdown`, which indicates whether nodes that are purely markdown should be hidden.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

## References

- `CellId` from `@/core/cells/ids`: This type is used in `GraphSelection` to uniquely identify nodes and edges in the graph.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@/core/cells/ids` | Provides the `CellId` type used to identify nodes and edges in the graph. |

## Error Handling

The code does not implement specific error handling mechanisms beyond basic type definitions.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The code does not explicitly define an API or public interface. It provides type definitions for use within the application.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
