## High-level description

The `DependencyGraph` component in the target file is a React component designed to visualize dependencies between different cells and variables in a graphical format. It provides two main views: a minimap view and a tree view, allowing users to switch between different layouts and configurations to better understand the relationships and dependencies within their data.

## Code Structure

The `DependencyGraph` component is the main symbol in the code, which utilizes several other components and hooks to render the dependency graph. It interacts with `DependencyGraphMinimap` and `DependencyGraphTree` components to render different views of the graph. The component also uses `GraphToolbar` to provide user controls for changing the graph's layout and settings.

## Symbols

### `DependencyGraph`
#### Description
The `DependencyGraph` component is responsible for rendering a graphical representation of dependencies between cells and variables. It allows users to switch between a minimap view and a tree view, and provides a toolbar for adjusting settings and layout direction.

#### Inputs
| Name       | Type                | Description                                      |
|:-----------|:--------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| cellIds    | `CellId[]`          | An array of cell identifiers.                    |
| variables  | `Variables`         | A record of variables with their dependencies.   |
| cellAtoms  | `Array&lt;Atom&lt;CellData&gt;&gt;` | An array of Jotai atoms representing cell data. |
| children   | `React.ReactNode`   | Optional children to be rendered within the component. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | The component does not return any values but renders UI. |

#### Internal Logic
- The component uses Jotai atoms `graphViewAtom` and `graphViewSettings` to manage the state of the graph's layout direction and settings.
- It defines a `renderGraph` function that conditionally renders either the `DependencyGraphMinimap` or `DependencyGraphTree` based on the current layout direction.
- The `GraphToolbar` component is included in both views to allow users to change settings and layout direction.

## References

- **`DependencyGraphMinimap`**: A component that renders the graph in a minimap view.
- **`DependencyGraphTree`**: A component that renders the graph in a tree view.
- **`GraphToolbar`**: A component that provides UI controls for changing graph settings and layout.
- **`GraphLayoutView` and `GraphSettings`**: Types that define the layout view options and settings for the graph.

## Dependencies

| Dependency   | Purpose                                                                 |
|:-------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `reactflow`  | Used for rendering and managing the flow of nodes and edges in the graph. |
| `jotai`      | State management library used for managing the state of the graph's layout and settings. |

## Error Handling

The component does not explicitly handle errors within its logic. It relies on the underlying libraries and components to manage any exceptions or errors that may occur during rendering or state updates.

## Logging

The component does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The `DependencyGraph` component does not expose an API or public interface beyond its props. It is intended to be used as a part of a larger application where it is integrated into the UI.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
