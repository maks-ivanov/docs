## High-level description

The `undo-button.tsx` file defines a React component called `UndoButton` that extends the functionality of a standard button by adding an event listener for keyboard shortcuts (specifically "Ctrl+Z" or "Cmd+Z") to trigger an undo action. This component is designed to be used in various parts of the application where an undo functionality is needed, providing both a visual button and a keyboard shortcut for user convenience.

## Code Structure

- The `UndoButton` component is a functional React component that utilizes the `useEventListener` hook to listen for specific keyboard events.
- It extends the `Button` component from the UI library, inheriting its properties and styles, while adding custom behavior for the undo action.
- The `MinimalHotkeys` component is used to display the keyboard shortcut associated with the button.

## References

- `useEventListener`: A custom hook used to attach event listeners to DOM elements.
- `MinimalHotkeys`: A component used to render the keyboard shortcut visually next to the button.
- `Button`: A UI component that provides the base styling and behavior for the `UndoButton`.

## Symbols

### `UndoButton`
#### Description
The `UndoButton` component is a specialized button that listens for "Ctrl+Z" or "Cmd+Z" keyboard events to trigger an undo action. It is designed to be used in contexts where an undo operation is applicable, such as text editors or data manipulation interfaces.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | `UndoButtonProps` | Properties for the button, extending `ButtonProps` but excluding `onClick`. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | `JSX.Element` | A button element with undo functionality and a displayed keyboard shortcut. |

#### Internal Logic
- The component uses the `useEventListener` hook to listen for "keydown" events on the `window` object.
- It checks if the "Ctrl" or "Meta" key is pressed along with the "Z" key.
- If the condition is met, it prevents the default action and stops the event from propagating further, then calls the `onClick` handler if provided.
- The button is rendered with a default label "Undo" unless overridden by `props.children`.
- The `MinimalHotkeys` component is used to display the "Cmd+Z" shortcut next to the button.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `useEventListener` | To attach a keyboard event listener for the undo shortcut. |
| `MinimalHotkeys` | To visually display the keyboard shortcut associated with the button. |
| `Button` | To provide the base button styling and behavior. |

## Error Handling

The component does not implement specific error handling mechanisms beyond basic event handling. It assumes that the `onClick` handler, if provided, will manage any errors related to the undo operation.

## Logging

The component does not include any logging mechanisms.
