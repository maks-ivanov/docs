## High-level description

The target file `icons.tsx` is a TypeScript module that maps different data types to corresponding icons using the `lucide-react` icon library. This mapping is used to visually represent data types in a user interface, making it easier for users to identify the type of data they are working with.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in this file is the `DATA_TYPE_ICON` object, which is a mapping between `DataType` values and `LucideIcon` components. This object is used in other parts of the codebase to dynamically select and display icons based on the data type.

## References

- `DataType` is imported from `@/core/kernel/messages`, which defines the possible data types that can be used in the application.
- Icons such as `ToggleLeftIcon`, `CalendarIcon`, `HashIcon`, `TypeIcon`, and `ListOrderedIcon` are imported from the `lucide-react` library.

## Symbols

### `DATA_TYPE_ICON`
#### Description
The `DATA_TYPE_ICON` is a constant object that maps each `DataType` to a specific icon component from the `lucide-react` library. This mapping is used to provide a visual representation of data types in the UI.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| DataType | enum | Represents the type of data, such as `boolean`, `date`, `number`, `string`, `integer`, or `unknown`. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| LucideIcon | component | The icon component corresponding to the given data type. |

#### Internal Logic
The `DATA_TYPE_ICON` object is a simple key-value mapping where each key is a `DataType` and each value is a `LucideIcon` component. The mapping is defined as follows:
- `boolean` maps to `ToggleLeftIcon`
- `date` maps to `CalendarIcon`
- `number` maps to `HashIcon`
- `string` and `unknown` map to `TypeIcon`
- `integer` maps to `ListOrderedIcon`

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `lucide-react` | Provides the icon components used in the mapping. |
| `@/core/kernel/messages` | Defines the `DataType` type used as keys in the mapping. |

## Usage

The `DATA_TYPE_ICON` object is used in other components, such as `DataTableColumnHeader` in `column-header.tsx`, to dynamically render icons based on the data type of a column. This enhances the user interface by providing intuitive visual cues about the data being displayed.

## Conclusion

The `icons.tsx` file is a utility module that provides a straightforward mapping between data types and icons. This mapping is leveraged in various parts of the application to improve the user experience by visually distinguishing different types of data.
