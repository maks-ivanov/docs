## High-level description

The `edit-page.tsx` file defines a React component called `EditPage`, which serves as a page for editing applications. It integrates several components, including `EditApp`, `AppChrome`, and `CommandPalette`, to provide a comprehensive editing interface. The component is designed to be used within a larger application, leveraging configurations passed as props to customize its behavior.

## Code Structure

The `EditPage` component is a functional React component that takes `Props` as its input. It uses the `AppChrome` component as a wrapper to provide a consistent UI layout, within which the `EditApp` and `CommandPalette` components are rendered. The `EditApp` component is responsible for the main editing functionalities, while the `CommandPalette` provides a command interface for user interactions.
