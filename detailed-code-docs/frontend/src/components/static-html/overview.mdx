## High-level description

The directory contains React components designed to enhance the user experience when interacting with static versions of Python notebooks. These components provide functionalities for sharing and managing static notebooks, including generating shareable links, copying content to the clipboard, and offering options to download or edit the notebook. The main components in this directory are `ShareStaticNotebookModal` and `StaticBanner`, each serving distinct purposes related to static notebook management.

## What does it do?

The components in this directory facilitate the sharing and management of static Python notebooks. 

- **ShareStaticNotebookModal**: This component provides a user interface for sharing a static version of a notebook. Users can input a custom slug to generate a unique URL for their notebook, which is then uploaded as a static HTML page. The component also allows users to copy the generated URL to the clipboard for easy sharing. It handles user interactions such as form submissions and error notifications, ensuring a smooth user experience.

- **StaticBanner**: This component displays a banner in static Python notebooks built using Marimo. It checks if the current notebook is static and retrieves the necessary Marimo code. If the conditions are met, it renders a banner that offers options to run or edit the notebook. Users can download the notebook code or use a WebAssembly link to interact with the notebook. The component also provides a dialog with instructions for these actions.

## Entry points

The main files in this directory are `share-modal.tsx` and `static-banner.tsx`. These files define the primary components that users interact with when managing static notebooks. The `ShareStaticNotebookModal` component is responsible for the sharing functionality, while the `StaticBanner` component provides options for running or editing the notebook. Both components are designed to be integrated into a larger application, providing specific functionalities related to static notebook management.

## Dependencies

The components rely on several external libraries and frameworks to function effectively:

- **React**: Used for creating and managing the state of React components.
- **@radix-ui/react-dialog**: Provides UI components for creating dialog structures, used in the `StaticBanner` component.
- **lucide-react**: Supplies icons for the user interface.
- **@/components/ui/button** and **@/components/ui/dialog**: Offer styled UI components for buttons and dialogs.
- **@/components/ui/use-toast**: Facilitates the display of toast notifications to inform users about the status of their actions.
- **@/core/network/requests**: Contains functions for network requests, including exporting notebooks as HTML.
- **@/core/static/virtual-file-tracker**: Manages virtual files associated with the notebook.
- **@/utils/events**: Provides utility functions for handling events.

These dependencies are chosen to streamline the development process, offering pre-built components and utilities that enhance the functionality and user experience of the application.
