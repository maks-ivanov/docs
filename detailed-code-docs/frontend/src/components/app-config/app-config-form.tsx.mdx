## High-level description

The `AppConfigForm` component in the target file is a React functional component that provides a form interface for configuring application settings, specifically the application's width and title. It utilizes the `react-hook-form` library for form management and validation, and it integrates with a backend service to save the configuration changes.

## Code Structure

- The `AppConfigForm` component is the main symbol in this file.
- It uses several UI components like `Form`, `FormField`, `FormItem`, `FormLabel`, `FormControl`, `FormMessage`, `Input`, and `NativeSelect` to build the form interface.
- It interacts with the application's configuration state through the `useAppConfig` hook and the `saveAppConfig` function to persist changes.

## References

- `useAppConfig` from `../../core/config/config` is used to access and update the application's configuration state.
- `saveAppConfig` from `../../core/network/requests` is used to persist the configuration changes to a backend service.
- `AppConfigSchema` and `AppTitleSchema` from `../../core/config/config-schema` are used for form validation.

## Symbols

### `AppConfigForm`
#### Description
The `AppConfigForm` component renders a form that allows users to configure the application's width and title. It uses `react-hook-form` for form state management and validation, and it updates the application state and backend with the new configuration upon submission.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | N/A  | The component does not take any props. It uses hooks to manage state and effects. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React Element | The rendered form component. |

#### Internal Logic
- **Form Initialization**: The form is initialized using `useForm` with `AppConfigSchema` for validation and default values from the current configuration.
- **Form Submission**: The `onSubmit` function is defined to handle form submission. It calls `saveAppConfig` to persist the changes and updates the local configuration state using `setConfig`.
- **Effect Hook**: A `useEffect` hook is used to dispatch a resize event whenever the width configuration changes, ensuring that UI components adjust to the new width.
- **Form Rendering**: The form includes fields for `width` and `app_title`, each with associated labels, controls, and validation messages. The `width` field uses a `NativeSelect` component, while the `app_title` field uses an `Input` component.

## Side Effects
- Dispatches a `resize` event on the `window` object when the width configuration changes.
- Updates the document's title when the `app_title` field is valid and changes.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `react-hook-form` | Manages form state and validation. |
| `@hookform/resolvers/zod` | Integrates Zod schema validation with `react-hook-form`. |
| `zod` | Provides schema validation for form inputs. |

## Error Handling
- The form uses Zod schemas (`AppConfigSchema` and `AppTitleSchema`) to validate inputs, ensuring that only valid data is submitted.
- Errors are displayed using the `FormMessage` component, which shows validation messages when inputs are invalid.

## Logging
- No explicit logging is implemented in this component. However, errors during form submission are caught and handled silently by updating the configuration state.

## TODOs
- There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
