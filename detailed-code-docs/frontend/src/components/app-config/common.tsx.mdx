## High-level description

The target file `common.tsx` defines three React functional components: `SettingTitle`, `SettingSubtitle`, and `SettingDescription`. These components are used to render styled text elements, specifically titles, subtitles, and descriptions, within a user interface. They are designed to be reusable components that can be used to maintain consistent styling across different parts of an application.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the three React functional components: `SettingTitle`, `SettingSubtitle`, and `SettingDescription`. Each of these components takes `children` as a prop, which allows them to render any nested content passed to them. These components are used in other parts of the application, as seen in the related files, to provide consistent styling for titles, subtitles, and descriptions in forms and settings pages.

## Side Effects

There are no notable side effects in these components as they are purely presentational and do not modify any external state or resources.

## Performance Considerations

These components are lightweight and primarily used for rendering styled text, so there are no significant performance considerations. They rely on React's efficient rendering mechanisms to update the UI when necessary.
