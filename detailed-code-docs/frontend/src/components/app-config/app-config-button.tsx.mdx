## High-level description

The `app-config-button.tsx` file defines a React component named `ConfigButton` that provides a user interface element for accessing application and user configuration settings. This component uses a popover to display configuration forms when the button is clicked, allowing users to modify settings related to the application and user preferences.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in this file is the `ConfigButton` component. It utilizes several imported components such as `Popover`, `PopoverContent`, `PopoverTrigger`, `Button`, `SettingsIcon`, `Tooltip`, `AppConfigForm`, and `UserConfigForm` to create a button that, when clicked, displays a popover containing configuration forms. The `ConfigButton` component is designed to be reusable and customizable through its props.

## Symbols

### `ConfigButton`
#### Description
The `ConfigButton` component is a React functional component that renders a button with a settings icon. When clicked, it opens a popover containing forms for configuring application and user settings. The component uses a tooltip to provide additional information about the button's purpose.

#### Inputs
| Name          | Type    | Description                                      |
|:--------------|:--------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| showAppConfig | boolean | Optional. Determines if the app config form is shown. Defaults to `true`. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React Element | The rendered button and popover component. |

#### Internal Logic
- The component uses the `Popover` component to manage the display of the popover.
- The `PopoverTrigger` is set to render as a child, which is a `Button` component styled as a small circle with a settings icon.
- A `Tooltip` is wrapped around the `SettingsIcon` to provide a "Settings" label when hovered.
- The `PopoverContent` contains the `AppConfigForm` and `UserConfigForm` components. The `AppConfigForm` is conditionally rendered based on the `showAppConfig` prop.
- The `PopoverContent` is styled to be scrollable and prevents focus from leaving the popover to avoid closing it unintentionally.

## References

- **`AppConfigForm`**: This component is imported from `app-config-form.tsx` and is used to render the application configuration form within the popover.
- **`UserConfigForm`**: This component is imported from `user-config-form.tsx` and is used to render the user configuration form within the popover.
- **`Popover`, `PopoverContent`, `PopoverTrigger`**: These components are imported from a UI library and are used to create and manage the popover's behavior and appearance.
- **`Button`**: A styled button component used as the trigger for the popover.
- **`SettingsIcon`**: An icon component from the `lucide-react` library used to visually represent the settings button.
- **`Tooltip`**: A component used to display additional information when the user hovers over the settings icon.

## Dependencies

| Dependency     | Purpose                                                  |
|:---------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
| `lucide-react` | Provides the `SettingsIcon` used in the button.          |
| `@/components/ui/popover` | Provides the `Popover`, `PopoverContent`, and `PopoverTrigger` components for creating the popover UI. |
| `@/components/editor/inputs/Inputs` | Provides the `Button` component used as the popover trigger. |
| `@/components/ui/tooltip` | Provides the `Tooltip` component for displaying tooltips. |

## Side Effects

- The `PopoverContent` component prevents focus from leaving the popover to avoid closing it when interacting with buttons inside the popover.

## Performance Considerations

- The component uses a popover with a scrollable content area, which can handle a large number of settings without affecting performance significantly.
- The use of `React.FC` and default props ensures that the component is flexible and can be used in various contexts without additional configuration.
