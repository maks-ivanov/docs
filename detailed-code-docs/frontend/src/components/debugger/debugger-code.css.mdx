## High-level description
The target file is a CSS stylesheet that defines a specific style for a component within a debugger interface. It targets the gutter element of an active line within a code editor, changing its background color to a light grayish-blue shade.

## Code Structure
The file contains a single CSS rule that applies styling to a specific element within the debugger component. The rule is defined using a CSS selector that targets a combination of class names.

## Symbols

### CSS Rule: `.debugger-input .cm-gutterElement.cm-activeLineGutter`
#### Description
This CSS rule is designed to style the gutter element of an active line within a code editor that is part of a debugger interface. The gutter is typically the area to the left of the code where line numbers or breakpoints are displayed.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `.debugger-input` | CSS Class | A class that likely represents the input area of the debugger component. |
| `.cm-gutterElement` | CSS Class | A class that represents the gutter element within the code editor. |
| `.cm-activeLineGutter` | CSS Class | A class that indicates the gutter element of the currently active line. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | The output is visual styling applied to the targeted element. |

#### Internal Logic
The CSS rule applies a background color of `#bdc8d2` to the targeted element. This color is a light grayish-blue, which is used to visually distinguish the active line's gutter from other lines.

## Side Effects
There are no side effects beyond the visual styling applied to the targeted element.

## Dependencies
The CSS rule relies on the presence of specific class names (`.debugger-input`, `.cm-gutterElement`, and `.cm-activeLineGutter`) being applied to elements within the HTML structure of the debugger component. These class names suggest integration with a code editor library, possibly CodeMirror, which is commonly used for such purposes.

## Configuration
There are no configuration options defined in this CSS file.

## Error Handling
There is no error handling in CSS. If the targeted elements do not exist in the HTML, the rule simply has no effect.

## Logging
There is no logging mechanism in CSS.

## API/Interface Reference
This CSS file does not define an API or public interface. It is purely for styling purposes.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
