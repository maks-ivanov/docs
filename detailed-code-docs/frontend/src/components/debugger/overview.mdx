## High-level description

The directory contains components related to a debugger interface within a frontend application. It includes a CSS file for styling and a TypeScript file that defines a React component for the debugger. The main purpose of this directory is to provide a user interface for debugging code, allowing users to input code, view output, and control the debugging process through various actions.

## What does it do?

The code in this directory implements a user interface for a code debugging tool. It allows users to input code, execute it, and view the output. The interface includes controls for common debugging actions such as stepping through code, continuing execution, and printing the stack trace. The styling ensures that the active line in the code editor is visually distinct, helping users to easily identify where they are in the code.

The `Debugger` component orchestrates the entire interface, integrating input, output, and control components to provide a seamless debugging experience. Users can enter code into the `DebuggerInput` area, which is then executed, and the results are displayed in the `DebuggerOutput` area. The `DebuggerControls` component provides buttons for executing specific debugging commands, enhancing the interactivity of the tool.

## Entry points

The main entry point for this directory is the `debugger-code.tsx` file, which defines the `Debugger` React component. This component is the central piece that brings together the input, output, and control functionalities to create a complete debugging interface. The CSS file, `debugger-code.css`, complements this by providing the necessary styling to enhance the user experience, particularly by highlighting the active line in the code editor.

## Key Files

- **`debugger-code.tsx`**: This file contains the main `Debugger` component, which integrates the input, output, and control components to form the debugging interface. It uses `ReactCodeMirror` for rendering code editors and handles user interactions through callbacks and event listeners.

- **`debugger-code.css`**: This CSS file provides styling for the debugger interface, specifically targeting the gutter of the active line in the code editor to make it visually distinct.

## Dependencies

The directory relies on several external libraries to provide its functionality:

- **`@uiw/react-codemirror`**: This library is used to render code editors within the `DebuggerOutput` and `DebuggerInput` components. It provides a React wrapper around the CodeMirror editor, which is widely used for code editing in web applications.

- **`lucide-react`**: This library provides icon components used in the `DebuggerControls` component, enhancing the visual appeal and usability of the control buttons.

- **`@uiw/codemirror-extensions-langs`**: This library provides language extensions for `ReactCodeMirror`, allowing the code editor to support syntax highlighting and other language-specific features.
