## High-level description

The `slides.css` file defines the CSS styles for a custom theme applied to a Swiper component, which is a popular library for creating sliders and carousels. The styles include custom properties for pagination, navigation buttons, and other visual elements of the Swiper component, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing design.

## Code Structure

The CSS file primarily consists of a single class, `.mo-slides-theme`, which encapsulates various CSS custom properties and styles for Swiper components. These properties are used to control the appearance of pagination bullets, navigation buttons, and other Swiper elements.

## Symbols

### `.mo-slides-theme`
#### Description
The `.mo-slides-theme` class is a CSS class that defines a custom theme for Swiper components. It sets various CSS custom properties that are used to style the Swiper's pagination and navigation elements.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | This is a CSS class, so it does not take inputs in the traditional sense. |

#### Outputs

| N/A  | N/A  | This class outputs styles that are applied to HTML elements. |

#### Internal Logic
- **Custom Properties**: The class defines several CSS custom properties (variables) that control the appearance of Swiper elements, such as pagination bullets and navigation buttons. These properties include colors, sizes, and positions.
- **Navigation Buttons**: Styles for `.swiper-button-prev` and `.swiper-button-next` are defined, including their size, position, background color, and opacity. The buttons have a transition effect for opacity, which changes on hover unless the button is disabled.
- **Font Face**: A custom font face, "swiper-icons", is defined for use with Swiper's navigation icons. This font is embedded using a base64-encoded WOFF file.
