### SlidesComponent
#### Description
The `SlidesComponent` is a React component that renders a slideshow using the Swiper library. It supports features like fullscreen mode, keyboard navigation, and customizable slide content. The component is styled using CSS and integrates with other UI components and utilities to offer a seamless user experience.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| className | string | Optional additional class names for styling. |
| children | ReactNode | The content to be displayed within each slide. |
| height | string \| number \| null | The height of the slideshow container. |
| forceKeyboardNavigation | boolean | Whether to force enable keyboard navigation. Defaults to false. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | JSX.Element | The rendered slideshow component. |

#### Internal Logic
- **Refs and State**: Uses a ref to access the Swiper instance and a state variable to track fullscreen mode.
- **Event Listener**: Utilizes `useEventListener` to toggle keyboard navigation based on fullscreen status.
- **Effect Hook**: Triggers a window resize event when fullscreen mode changes to ensure proper layout.
- **Rendering**: Renders a `Swiper` component with various modules and configurations. It maps over `children` to create individual `SwiperSlide` components.
- **Fullscreen Toggle**: A button toggles fullscreen mode, updating the state and requesting or exiting fullscreen on the DOM element.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the document's fullscreen state.
- Dispatches a window resize event when fullscreen mode changes.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Core library for building the component. |
| Swiper | Provides the slideshow functionality. |
| cn | Utility for merging class names. |
| useEventListener | Custom hook for managing event listeners. |

## References
