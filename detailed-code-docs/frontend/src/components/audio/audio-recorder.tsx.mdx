## High-level description

The `audio-recorder.tsx` file defines a React component named `AudioRecorder` that provides a user interface for controlling audio recording. It allows users to start, stop, and pause audio recordings, displaying the current recording status and elapsed time. The component uses icons to visually represent the recording state and integrates with a custom hook to manage the recording process.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in this file is the `AudioRecorder` component, which is a functional React component. It uses several props to manage its behavior and appearance, including functions for handling start, stop, and pause actions, as well as the current recording status and elapsed time. The component uses the `Button` component from the UI library to create interactive buttons and imports icons from the `lucide-react` library to visually represent the recording state.

## Symbols

### `AudioRecorder`
#### Description
The `AudioRecorder` component is a React functional component that provides a user interface for audio recording. It displays buttons to start, stop, and pause the recording based on the current recording status and shows the elapsed recording time.

#### Inputs
| Name   | Type             | Description                                      |
|:-------|:-----------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| onStart | `() =&gt; void`    | Function to call when the recording starts.      |
| onStop  | `() =&gt; void`    | Function to call when the recording stops.       |
| onPause | `() =&gt; void`    | Function to call when the recording is paused.   |
| status  | `RecordingStatus` | Current status of the recording (e.g., "stopped", "recording"). |
| time    | `string` (optional) | The elapsed time of the recording, displayed as a string. |

#### Outputs
The component does not return any outputs but renders UI elements based on the provided props.

#### Internal Logic
- The component renders a `div` containing buttons and a time display.
- It conditionally renders a start button when the status is "stopped", a pause button when the status is "recording", and displays the elapsed time if provided.
- The start button uses a `CircleIcon`, and the pause button uses a `SquareIcon` and a `CircleIcon` for a visual effect.
- The `Button` component is used to create interactive buttons with specific styles and behaviors.

## References

- The `AudioRecorder` component uses the `Button` component from `../ui/button` to create styled buttons.
- It imports `CircleIcon` and `SquareIcon` from the `lucide-react` library for visual representation of recording states.
- The `RecordingStatus` type is imported from `@/hooks/useAudioRecorder`, which defines the possible states of the recording process.
- The `cn` utility function from `@/utils/cn` is used to merge and apply CSS class names conditionally.

| `React`      | Provides the base library for building the component.                   |
| `lucide-react` | Supplies the icons used for visual representation of recording states. |
| `@/utils/cn` | Utility function for merging and applying CSS class names.              |

## Error Handling

The component does not implement specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on the parent component or hook to manage any errors related to audio recording.

## Logging

The component does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The `AudioRecorder` component does not expose an API but provides a user interface for controlling audio recording through its props. It interacts with the parent component or hook to manage the recording process.
