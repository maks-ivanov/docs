## High-level description

The `lazy-mount.tsx` file defines a React component called `LazyMount`. This component is designed to delay the mounting of its children until a specified condition, `isOpen`, is met for the first time. It is useful for optimizing performance by preventing unnecessary rendering of components until they are needed.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in this file is the `LazyMount` component. It uses React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage its internal state and determine when to render its children. The component takes in props that include a boolean `isOpen` and any children components to be conditionally rendered.

## Symbols

### `LazyMount`
#### Description
The `LazyMount` component is a React functional component that conditionally renders its children based on the `isOpen` prop. It ensures that the children are only mounted once, the first time `isOpen` becomes true.

#### Inputs
| Name     | Type                | Description                          |
|:---------|:--------------------|:-------------------------------------|
| isOpen   | boolean             | A flag indicating whether the component should render its children. |
| children | React.ReactNode     | The child components to be rendered when `isOpen` is true. |

#### Outputs
| Name     | Type                | Description                          |
|:---------|:--------------------|:-------------------------------------|
| children | React.ReactNode or null | The children are returned if `isOpen` is true and the component has been mounted; otherwise, null is returned. |

#### Internal Logic
- The component initializes a state variable `isMounted` to track whether the children have been mounted.
- It uses the `useEffect` hook to monitor changes to the `isOpen` and `isMounted` states.
- If `isOpen` is true and `isMounted` is false, it sets `isMounted` to true, triggering the rendering of the children.
- The component returns the children if `isMounted` is true; otherwise, it returns null.

## References

The `LazyMount` component is used in the `app-chrome.tsx` file, where it is employed to conditionally render a terminal component based on the `isTerminalOpen` state.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React      | Used for creating the component and managing state and effects. |

## Error Handling

The `LazyMount` component does not implement any specific error handling mechanisms beyond basic React component behavior.

## Logging

There are no logging mechanisms implemented in this code.

## API/Interface Reference

The `LazyMount` component does not expose any API or public interface beyond its props. It is a standard React component used within other components to manage conditional rendering.
