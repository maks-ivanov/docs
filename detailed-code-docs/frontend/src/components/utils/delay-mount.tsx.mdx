## High-level description

The `DelayMount` component in the target file is a React component designed to delay the rendering of its children for a specified amount of time. It uses a timeout to control when the children are mounted, providing an optional fallback component to display during the delay period. This is useful for managing the user interface's perceived performance, especially when loading components that might take time to initialize.

## Code Structure

The `DelayMount` component is a functional React component that utilizes React hooks (`useState` and `useEffect`) to manage its internal state and lifecycle. It takes in props that define the delay duration, the children to render after the delay, and an optional fallback component to display during the delay.

## Symbols

### `DelayMount`
#### Description
The `DelayMount` component delays the rendering of its children by a specified number of milliseconds. It uses a timeout to set a state variable that determines whether the children should be rendered. If the delay has not yet elapsed, it renders an optional fallback component instead.

#### Inputs
| Name         | Type             | Description                                      |
|:-------------|:-----------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| milliseconds | number           | The delay in milliseconds before rendering children. |
| children     | React.ReactNode  | The React nodes to render after the delay.       |
| fallback     | React.ReactNode  | Optional. The React nodes to render during the delay. |

#### Outputs
| Name    | Type            | Description                                      |
|:--------|:----------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| output1 | React.ReactNode | Renders either the children or the fallback based on the delay. |

#### Internal Logic
- Initializes a state variable `mounted` to `false`.
- Uses `useEffect` to set a timeout that updates `mounted` to `true` after the specified delay (`milliseconds`).
- Returns a cleanup function from `useEffect` to clear the timeout if the component unmounts before the delay completes.
- Conditionally renders `children` if `mounted` is `true`; otherwise, renders `fallback`.

## References

- The `DelayMount` component is used in the `TableColumnSummary` component within the `column-summary.tsx` file. It is used to delay the rendering of a chart component, providing a `ChartSkeleton` as a fallback during the delay.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose                                      |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------------|
| React      | Provides the necessary hooks and components for building the `DelayMount` component. |

## Error Handling

The `DelayMount` component does not implement specific error handling mechanisms beyond basic React component lifecycle management.

## Logging

The `DelayMount` component does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## Side Effects

- The component sets a timeout using `setTimeout` and clears it using `clearTimeout` to manage the delay in rendering.

## Performance Considerations

- The use of `setTimeout` introduces a delay in rendering, which can be useful for managing perceived performance but should be used judiciously to avoid unnecessary delays in user interactions.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
