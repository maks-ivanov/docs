## High-level description

The `TailwindIndicator` component is a React functional component designed to display a visual indicator of the current Tailwind CSS breakpoint. It is intended for use in development environments to help developers understand which responsive breakpoint is currently active. The component is conditionally rendered based on the environment, ensuring it does not appear in production.

## Code Structure

The `TailwindIndicator` component is a standalone functional component that uses Tailwind CSS classes to style its output. It is used in other parts of the application, such as in the `MarimoApp` and Storybook preview, to provide a visual cue of the active CSS breakpoint during development.

## Symbols

### `TailwindIndicator`
#### Description
The `TailwindIndicator` component is a React functional component that displays a small, fixed-position indicator on the screen. This indicator shows the current Tailwind CSS breakpoint (e.g., `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`) based on the screen size. It is only rendered in non-production environments to assist developers in understanding the responsive design behavior of the application.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | N/A  | The component does not take any props or inputs. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX Element | React Element | A JSX element representing the breakpoint indicator, or `null` if in production. |

#### Internal Logic
- The component first checks the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. If it is set to "production", the component returns `null`, meaning it will not render anything.
- If not in production, the component returns a `div` element styled with Tailwind CSS classes. This `div` contains several nested `div` elements, each corresponding to a different Tailwind CSS breakpoint.
- Each nested `div` is conditionally displayed based on the current screen size, using Tailwind's responsive utility classes (`block`, `hidden`, etc.).

## Side Effects
- The component does not have any side effects. It purely renders UI elements based on the environment and screen size.

## References

- The `TailwindIndicator` component is imported and used in the `MarimoApp` and Storybook preview files. It is included within the UI structure to provide a visual indication of the current CSS breakpoint during development.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Used to create the functional component. |
| Tailwind CSS | Provides the utility classes for styling and responsive behavior. |

## Configuration

The component relies on the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to determine whether it should render. It is configured to only display in non-production environments.

## Error Handling

The component does not implement any specific error handling mechanisms, as it is a simple UI component with no complex logic or external dependencies that could fail.

## Logging

The component does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The `TailwindIndicator` component does not expose any API or public interface beyond its inclusion in the React component tree. It is used internally within the application to provide development-time feedback.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
