title: "setup.ts"

## High-level description
The target file `setup.ts` is a setup script for testing purposes in a frontend application. It imports a polyfill for the `Blob` API, which is necessary for testing the serialization and deserialization (ser/deser) of binary large objects (blobs) in environments that may not natively support this API.

## Code Structure
The file consists of a single import statement. The import of the `blob-polyfill` is crucial for ensuring that the tests involving blobs can run in environments that do not have native support for the `Blob` API.

## Symbols

### `import "blob-polyfill";`
#### Description
This import statement includes the `blob-polyfill` library, which provides a polyfill for the `Blob` API. This is essential for testing environments that lack native support for blobs, ensuring that tests involving blob operations can be executed consistently across different environments.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | The import statement does not take any inputs. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | The import statement does not produce any direct outputs. |

## Dependencies
| Dependency    | Purpose                                                                 |
|:--------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| blob-polyfill | Provides a polyfill for the `Blob` API, enabling blob operations in environments without native support. |

## Side Effects
The inclusion of the `blob-polyfill` modifies the global environment by adding or enhancing the `Blob` API, allowing tests that rely on blob operations to function correctly in environments that do not natively support this API.

## Performance Considerations
The use of a polyfill can introduce slight performance overhead compared to native implementations. However, this is necessary to ensure compatibility across different testing environments.

## Error Handling
The file does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. The polyfill itself is expected to handle any compatibility issues internally.

## Logging
There are no logging mechanisms implemented in this file.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or additional notes in the code.
