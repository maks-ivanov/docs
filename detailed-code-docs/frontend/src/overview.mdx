## High-level description

The `frontend/src` directory is a comprehensive part of a frontend application, primarily focused on building a sophisticated and interactive user interface. It encompasses a wide range of components and utilities, including state management, theming, plugin management, testing, and more. The directory is organized into several subdirectories, each dedicated to specific aspects of the application's functionality, such as components, core logic, CSS styling, hooks, plugins, stories for UI testing, and utilities.

## What does it do?

The `frontend/src` directory collectively provides the following functionalities:

1. **User Interface Components**: The `components` directory contains a wide array of React components that build the application's UI. These components handle various functionalities, such as application configuration, audio recording, data visualization, debugging, code editing, exporting outputs, form handling, and more. They are designed to be flexible, reusable, and easily integrated into the application.

2. **Core Logic and State Management**: The `core` directory manages essential functionalities like state management using Jotai, WebSocket connections for real-time communication, code execution using WebAssembly, and error handling. It provides a robust framework for building a sophisticated notebook application with advanced features.

3. **Styling and Theming**: The `css` and `theme` directories manage the visual presentation and theming of the application. They ensure consistent styling across different parts of the application and allow for dynamic theme switching based on user preferences or system settings.

4. **Custom Hooks**: The `hooks` directory offers custom React hooks that enhance component functionality and performance. These hooks manage asynchronous data, handle audio recording, optimize performance with debouncing, manage event listeners, and more.

5. **Plugin Management**: The `plugins` directory facilitates the creation and management of plugins, providing a structured framework for defining and rendering modular components that enhance the application's functionality.

6. **UI Testing with Storybook**: The `stories` directory sets up Storybook for visually testing and documenting UI components in isolation. It allows developers to interact with components, customize their properties, and observe their behavior without running the entire application.

7. **Utilities**: The `utils` directory contains utility functions and classes that support various operations, such as asynchronous programming, logging, data manipulation, error handling, file operations, and more. These utilities enhance the efficiency and maintainability of the codebase.

8. **Testing Setup**: The `__tests__` directory includes setup scripts for testing, such as polyfills for APIs not natively supported in testing environments, ensuring consistent test execution.

Overall, the `frontend/src` directory provides a comprehensive framework for building a sophisticated and interactive web application, leveraging modern React practices and libraries to ensure performance, flexibility, and ease of use.
