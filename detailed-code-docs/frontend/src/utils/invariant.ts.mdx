## High-level description

The `invariant.ts` file defines a utility function `invariant` that is used to enforce conditions within the code. This function is a type assertion utility that throws an error with a specified message if a given condition is not met. It is used to ensure that certain assumptions hold true during runtime, providing a mechanism for error handling and debugging.

## Code Structure

The file contains overloaded versions of the `invariant` function, which are used to assert conditions and provide type safety. The function is defined in three variations to handle different types of conditions and assertions.

## Symbols

### `invariant`
#### Description
The `invariant` function is a utility that asserts a condition and throws an error with a specified message if the condition is false. It is used to enforce runtime checks and provide type assertions in TypeScript.

#### Inputs
| Name      | Type    | Description                                      |
|:----------|:--------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| condition | boolean | The condition to assert.                         |
| message   | string  | The error message to throw if the condition fails.|

#### Outputs
This function does not return any output. Instead, it throws an error if the condition is not met.

#### Internal Logic
- The function checks if the `condition` is false.
- If the condition is false, it throws an `Error` with the provided `message`.
- The function is defined with TypeScript's `asserts` keyword, which allows it to be used for type narrowing in TypeScript, ensuring that the condition is true in subsequent code execution.

## References

The `invariant` function is referenced in multiple files across the codebase, indicating its utility in enforcing conditions and type safety. It is used in various contexts, such as validating data types, ensuring non-null values, and checking preconditions before executing logic.

## Dependencies

There are no external dependencies in this file. The `invariant` function is a standalone utility.

## Error Handling

The `invariant` function provides a basic error handling mechanism by throwing an error with a custom message when a condition is not met. This allows developers to catch and handle these errors in higher-level logic, facilitating debugging and ensuring that assumptions in the code are validated.

## Usage

The `invariant` function is used throughout the codebase to enforce conditions and provide runtime checks. It is particularly useful in scenarios where certain assumptions must hold true for the code to function correctly, such as ensuring that a variable is not null or that an array has a specific length. By using `invariant`, developers can catch potential issues early and provide meaningful error messages to aid in debugging.
