## High-level description

The target file, `blob.ts`, provides utility functions for serializing and deserializing `Blob` objects to and from base64-encoded data URLs. This allows for the conversion of binary data into a text format that can be easily stored or transmitted, and then converted back into its original binary form.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are two functions: `serializeBlob` and `deserializeBlob`. These functions are responsible for converting `Blob` objects to base64-encoded strings and vice versa. The `ensureError` function is a helper used to ensure that any errors thrown are instances of the `Error` class.

## Symbols

### `serializeBlob`
#### Description
The `serializeBlob` function converts a `Blob` object into a base64-encoded data URL string. This is useful for encoding binary data into a text format that can be easily stored or transmitted.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| blob | Blob | The `Blob` object to be serialized into a base64-encoded data URL. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Promise&lt;DataURLString&gt; | A promise that resolves to a base64-encoded data URL string representing the `Blob`. |

#### Internal Logic
- A `FileReader` is used to read the `Blob` as a data URL.
- The `onload` event handler resolves the promise with the result.
- The `onerror` event handler rejects the promise with an error message if reading fails.

### `deserializeBlob`
#### Description
The `deserializeBlob` function converts a base64-encoded data URL string back into a `Blob` object. This is useful for decoding text-encoded binary data back into its original binary form.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| serializedBlob | DataURLString | The base64-encoded data URL string to be deserialized into a `Blob`. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Promise&lt;Blob&gt; | A promise that resolves to a `Blob` object. |

#### Internal Logic
- The function splits the data URL to extract the base64 data and MIME type.
- The base64 string is decoded into a binary string.
- The binary string is converted into a `Uint8Array`.
- A new `Blob` is created from the `Uint8Array` and resolved.

### `ensureError`
#### Description
The `ensureError` function ensures that a given error is an instance of the `Error` class. If not, it converts it into an `Error`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | unknown | The error to be ensured as an `Error` instance. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Error | An `Error` instance. |

## References

- The `DataURLString` type is imported from `json/base64.ts`, which defines the structure of a base64-encoded data URL.
- The `serializeBlob` function is used in `upload.tsx` to convert files into base64 strings for upload.
- The `deserializeBlob` function is used in `files.ts` to convert base64 strings back into `Blob` objects for virtual file handling.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `FileReader` | Used to read `Blob` objects as data URLs. |
| `atob` | Decodes base64 strings into binary strings. |
| `Blob` | Represents binary data in the form of file-like objects. |

## Error Handling

- The `serializeBlob` function handles errors by rejecting the promise with an error message if the `FileReader` encounters an error.
- The `deserializeBlob` function uses the `ensureError` function to ensure that any caught errors are instances of the `Error` class before rejecting the promise.

## Logging

No explicit logging mechanisms are implemented in the target file. However, error messages are provided when promises are rejected.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
