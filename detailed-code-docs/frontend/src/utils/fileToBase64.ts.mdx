## High-level description

The target file, `fileToBase64.ts`, provides utility functions to convert file data into base64-encoded strings. It includes two main functions: `blobToBase64`, which converts a single `Blob` object to a base64 string, and `filesToBase64`, which processes an array of `File` objects, converting each to a base64 string and returning a promise that resolves to an array of tuples containing the file name and its base64-encoded contents.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are two functions: `blobToBase64` and `filesToBase64`. The `filesToBase64` function utilizes `blobToBase64` to perform its operations, indicating a hierarchical relationship where `filesToBase64` depends on `blobToBase64` for converting individual files.

## Symbols

### `blobToBase64`
#### Description
Converts a `Blob` object into a base64-encoded string. This is achieved by using the `FileReader` API to read the blob as a data URL and then extracting the base64 content from the resulting string.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| blob | Blob | The `Blob` object to be converted to a base64 string. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise | Promise&lt;string&gt; | A promise that resolves to the base64-encoded string of the blob's contents. |

#### Internal Logic
1. A `FileReader` instance is created.
2. The `readAsDataURL` method is called on the `FileReader` to read the blob.
3. An `onload` event handler is set up to process the result once reading is complete.
4. The base64 content is extracted from the data URL and resolved via the promise.

### `filesToBase64`
#### Description
Converts an array of `File` objects into an array of tuples, where each tuple contains the file name and its base64-encoded contents. This function leverages `blobToBase64` to handle the conversion of each file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| files | File[] | An array of `File` objects to be converted to base64 strings. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise | Promise&lt;Array&lt;[string, string]&gt;&gt; | A promise that resolves to an array of tuples, each containing a file name and its base64-encoded contents. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `Promise.all` to handle the conversion of multiple files concurrently.
2. Maps over the array of files, calling `blobToBase64` for each file.
3. Constructs a tuple of the file name and its base64-encoded contents for each file.
4. Resolves the promise with an array of these tuples.

## References

- The `filesToBase64` function is referenced in the `FileUploadPlugin` class in the `FileUploadPlugin.tsx` file, where it is used to convert uploaded files to base64 format.
- The `blobToBase64` function is referenced in the `MicrophonePlugin.tsx` file, where it is used to convert audio recordings to base64 format.

## Dependencies

The code relies on the `FileReader` API, which is a standard web API for reading file contents in web applications.

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors within the `blobToBase64` or `filesToBase64` functions. Any errors during the file reading process would need to be managed by the calling code, as seen in the related `FileUploadPlugin.tsx` file, where errors are logged and user feedback is provided via a toast notification.

## Logging

No logging mechanisms are implemented directly within the target file. However, related files like `FileUploadPlugin.tsx` use a `Logger` utility to log errors when file conversion fails.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the target file.
