## High-level description

The `events.ts` file defines a utility object `Events` that provides two functions, `stopPropagation` and `onEnter`, to handle common event-related tasks in a React application. These functions are designed to simplify event handling by encapsulating logic for stopping event propagation and executing callbacks when the Enter key is pressed.

## Code Structure

The `Events` object contains two methods:
- `stopPropagation`: A higher-order function that stops the propagation of an event and optionally executes a callback.
- `onEnter`: A higher-order function that executes a callback when the Enter key is pressed.

## Symbols

### `Events`
#### Description
The `Events` object provides utility functions for handling events in a React application. It includes methods to stop event propagation and to trigger actions when the Enter key is pressed.

#### Methods

##### `stopPropagation`
###### Description
This method returns a function that stops the propagation of an event and optionally executes a provided callback function.

###### Inputs
| Name     | Type     | Description                              |
|:---------|:---------|:-----------------------------------------|
| callback | function | An optional callback to execute after stopping event propagation. |

###### Outputs
| Name  | Type       | Description                              |
|:------|:-----------|:-----------------------------------------|
| event | function   | A function that takes an event and stops its propagation. |

###### Internal Logic
- The method takes an optional callback function as an argument.
- It returns a new function that, when called with an event, stops the event's propagation using `event.stopPropagation()`.
- If a callback is provided, it is executed with the event as its argument.

##### `onEnter`
###### Description
This method returns a function that executes a callback when the Enter key is pressed.

###### Inputs
| Name     | Type     | Description                              |
|:---------|:---------|:-----------------------------------------|
| callback | function | An optional callback to execute when the Enter key is pressed. |

###### Outputs
| Name  | Type       | Description                              |
|:------|:-----------|:-----------------------------------------|
| event | function   | A function that takes an event and checks if the Enter key was pressed. |

###### Internal Logic
- The method takes an optional callback function as an argument.
- It returns a new function that, when called with an event, checks if the event's key is "Enter".
- If the key is "Enter" and a callback is provided, the callback is executed with the event as its argument.

## References

The `Events` object is used in various components across the codebase, as seen in the related files. It is used to handle event propagation and keypress events in components like `UrlDetector`, `NameCellInput`, `DataSourcesPanel`, and others.

## Dependencies

The `events.ts` file does not have any external dependencies. It relies solely on TypeScript and JavaScript's built-in event handling capabilities.

## Error Handling

The methods in the `Events` object do not implement specific error handling mechanisms. They assume that the provided callbacks, if any, are safe to execute.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in the `events.ts` file.
