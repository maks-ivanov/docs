## High-level description

The `pluralize.ts` file provides utility classes for handling the pluralization of words based on a given count. It defines two classes, `PluralWord` and `PluralWords`, which facilitate the conversion of singular words to their plural forms and allow for the joining of multiple pluralized words with a specified separator.

## Code Structure

- **`PluralWord` Class**: Represents a single word with its singular and optional plural form. It provides methods to determine the correct form (singular or plural) based on a count.
- **`PluralWords` Class**: Manages a collection of `PluralWord` instances or strings, allowing for the pluralization and joining of these words.

## Symbols

### `PluralWord`
#### Description
The `PluralWord` class is designed to handle the pluralization of a single word. It stores the singular form of the word and optionally a custom plural form. If no custom plural form is provided, it defaults to appending an "s" to the singular form.

#### Inputs
| Name     | Type   | Description                        |
|:---------|:-------|:-----------------------------------|
| singular | string | The singular form of the word.     |
| _plural  | string | (Optional) The custom plural form. |

#### Outputs
| Name   | Type   | Description                        |
|:-------|:-------|:-----------------------------------|
| plural | string | The plural form of the word.       |

#### Internal Logic
- **`pluralize(count: number)`**: Returns the singular form if the count is 1, otherwise returns the plural form.
- **`get plural()`**: A getter that returns the custom plural form if provided, otherwise defaults to appending "s" to the singular form.

### `PluralWords`
#### Description
The `PluralWords` class manages a collection of `PluralWord` instances or strings. It provides functionality to pluralize each word in the collection based on a given count and join them with a specified separator.

#### Inputs
| Name  | Type          | Description                        |
|:------|:--------------|:-----------------------------------|
| words | PluralWord[]  | An array of `PluralWord` instances.|

#### Outputs
| Name | Type   | Description                        |
|:-----|:-------|:-----------------------------------|
| join | string | The joined string of pluralized words.|

#### Internal Logic
- **`static of(...words: Array&lt;PluralWord | string&gt;)`**: A static method that creates a `PluralWords` instance from an array of `PluralWord` instances or strings. Strings are converted to `PluralWord` instances with default pluralization.
- **`join(str: string, count: number)`**: Pluralizes each word in the collection based on the count and joins them using the provided separator string.

## References

- The `PluralWord` class is used in the `DataTablePagination` component in `pagination.tsx` to handle the pluralization of the word "row" based on the number of rows.
- The `PluralWords` class is used in the `FileBrowserPlugin` to handle pluralization of file and folder labels.
