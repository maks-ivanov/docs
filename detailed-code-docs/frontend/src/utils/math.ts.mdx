## High-level description

The target file `math.ts` contains a utility function `clamp` that restricts a given number to be within a specified range. This function is useful in scenarios where a value needs to be constrained between a minimum and maximum limit, ensuring it does not exceed these bounds.

## Code Structure

The file consists of a single exported function:

- `clamp`: This function takes three numerical arguments and returns a value that is constrained within the specified minimum and maximum range.

## Symbols

### `clamp`
#### Description
The `clamp` function is designed to ensure that a given numerical value does not fall outside a specified range. It achieves this by returning the value itself if it is within the range, the minimum if the value is below the range, or the maximum if the value is above the range.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| value | number | The number to be clamped. |
| min | number | The lower bound of the range. |
| max | number | The upper bound of the range. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | number | The clamped value, constrained between the specified min and max. |

#### Internal Logic
The function uses the `Math.min` and `Math.max` methods to achieve the clamping. It first applies `Math.max` to ensure the value is not less than the minimum, and then `Math.min` to ensure it is not greater than the maximum.

## References

The `clamp` function is referenced in several related files, indicating its utility across different parts of the codebase:

- **`frontend/src/core/cells/cells.ts`**: The `clamp` function is used to ensure that focus indices for cells are within valid bounds when navigating through cells in a notebook-like interface.
- **`frontend/src/core/codemirror/language/extension.ts`**: It is used to adjust cursor positions within the editor, ensuring they remain within the valid range of the document length.
- **`frontend/src/plugins/layout/ProgressPlugin.tsx`**: The function is used to constrain progress values between 0 and 100, ensuring that progress bars display correctly.

## Dependencies

The `clamp` function does not have any external dependencies, as it relies solely on JavaScript's built-in `Math` object.

## Side Effects

There are no side effects associated with the `clamp` function. It is a pure function that returns a value based solely on its inputs without modifying any external state.

## Performance Considerations

The `clamp` function is efficient, with constant time complexity O(1), as it performs a fixed number of operations regardless of the input size. This makes it suitable for frequent use in performance-critical applications.
