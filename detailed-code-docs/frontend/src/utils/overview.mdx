## High-level description

The `frontend/src/utils` directory contains a collection of utility functions and classes designed to support various operations within a frontend application. These utilities cover a wide range of functionalities, including asynchronous programming, logging, array and object manipulation, error handling, file operations, and more. The directory is structured to provide reusable components that enhance the efficiency and maintainability of the codebase.

## What does it do?

The utilities in this directory serve multiple purposes:

- **Asynchronous Operations**: Classes like `Deferred` facilitate the management of promises that can be resolved or rejected externally, aiding in complex asynchronous workflows.

- **Logging**: The `Logger` utility provides a consistent interface for logging messages, warnings, and errors, with conditional logging based on the environment.

- **Data Manipulation**: Functions for manipulating arrays, objects, and maps are provided, allowing for operations like filtering, mapping, and merging.

- **Error Handling**: Utilities like `assertExists` and `assertNever` ensure type safety and handle unexpected cases in TypeScript.

- **File and Blob Operations**: Functions for converting files and blobs to base64 strings, downloading files, and manipulating filenames are included.

- **Path and URL Handling**: Utilities for handling file paths and URLs, including resolving relative paths and updating query parameters, are provided.

- **Performance and Time Management**: The `Tracer` class measures code execution performance, while the `Time` class handles time-related operations.

- **Type Safety**: TypeScript utility types like `TypedNumber` and `TypedString` enforce type safety for numbers and strings.

- **WebSocket Management**: The `waitForWs` function ensures reliable WebSocket connections with retry logic.

- **String and Number Formatting**: Functions for formatting strings and numbers into human-readable formats are available.

- **Testing**: The directory includes unit tests to verify the functionality of various utilities, ensuring reliability and correctness.

These utilities are designed to be used throughout the application, providing common functionality that can be leveraged by different components and modules. They help streamline development by offering ready-to-use solutions for common tasks, reducing the need for repetitive code and enhancing code quality.
