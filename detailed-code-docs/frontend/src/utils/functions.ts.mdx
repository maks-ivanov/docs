## High-level description

The `functions.ts` file defines a utility object `Functions` that contains several utility functions commonly used throughout the codebase. These functions include no-operation functions, a function to throw errors, a utility to handle updater functions, and an identity function. Additionally, the file provides a standalone function `throwNotImplemented` to signal unimplemented functionality.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in this file is the `Functions` object, which encapsulates several utility functions. These functions are used across different parts of the codebase, as seen in the related code snippets. The `throwNotImplemented` function is a standalone export.

## Symbols

### `Functions`
#### Description
The `Functions` object is a collection of utility functions that provide common operations such as no-operations, error throwing, and identity transformations. These functions are designed to be reused across the application to simplify common patterns and error handling.

#### Internal Logic
- **NOOP**: A no-operation function that does nothing and returns `undefined`.
- **ASYNC_NOOP**: An asynchronous version of the no-operation function.
- **THROW**: A function that throws an error with the message "Should not be called".
- **asUpdater**: A utility function that takes either a value or a function and returns a function. If the input is a function, it returns the function; otherwise, it returns a function that always returns the input value.
- **identity**: A function that returns its input value unchanged.

### `throwNotImplemented`
#### Description
The `throwNotImplemented` function is used to signal that a particular piece of functionality has not been implemented. It throws an error with the message "Not implemented".

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Error | Error | Throws an error indicating unimplemented functionality |

## References

- The `Functions` object is referenced in various parts of the codebase, as seen in the related snippets. It is used for handling no-operation scenarios, error throwing, and identity transformations.
- The `throwNotImplemented` function is used in the `IslandsPyodideBridge` and `PyodideBridge` classes to indicate unimplemented methods.

## Dependencies

This file does not have any external dependencies. It provides utility functions that are self-contained and do not rely on external libraries or modules.

## Error Handling

The `THROW` function and `throwNotImplemented` function are used for error handling by explicitly throwing errors when certain conditions are met or when functionality is not implemented. This approach helps in identifying and managing error scenarios in the application.

## Usage

The utility functions in this file are designed to be used throughout the application wherever their specific functionality is needed. They provide a consistent way to handle common operations and error scenarios, improving code readability and maintainability.
