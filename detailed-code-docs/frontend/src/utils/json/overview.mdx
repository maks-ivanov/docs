## High-level description

The directory `frontend/src/utils/json` is focused on providing utility functions and tests for handling JSON data, particularly in the context of serialization and deserialization involving Base64 encoding. It includes functions for converting JSON objects to Base64 strings and vice versa, parsing JSON strings with special characters, and creating Data URLs from Base64 strings. The directory also contains unit tests to ensure the correctness of these operations.

## What does it do?

The code in this directory is designed to facilitate the conversion and parsing of JSON data in various formats. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. **Serialization and Deserialization**: The code provides functions to serialize JSON objects into Base64-encoded strings and to deserialize Base64 strings back into JSON objects. This is useful for encoding data in a compact format that can be easily transmitted or stored.

2. **Handling Special JSON Values**: The `json-parser.ts` file includes a function that can parse JSON strings containing non-standard values like `NaN`, `Infinity`, and `-Infinity`. These values are not typically supported in JSON, so the function uses a regex-based approach to handle them, ensuring they are correctly interpreted in JavaScript.

3. **Data URL Creation**: The code also includes functionality to create Data URLs from Base64 strings, which can be used to embed data directly within web pages.

4. **Testing**: The directory contains unit tests to verify that the serialization and deserialization functions work as expected. These tests ensure that JSON objects can be accurately encoded and decoded, maintaining data integrity.

## Entry points

The main files in this directory are:

- **`base64.ts`**: This file contains the core utility functions for handling Base64 and JSON string conversions. It defines types for strongly-typed strings and includes functions for deserializing Base64 strings, parsing JSON strings, and creating Data URLs.

- **`json-parser.ts`**: This file provides a specialized JSON parsing function that can handle non-standard JSON values like `NaN` and `Infinity`. It is used across the codebase to ensure consistent parsing of JSON data.

- **`__tests__`**: This subdirectory contains unit tests for the serialization and deserialization functions. The tests are written using the `vitest` framework and validate the correctness of the encoding and decoding processes.

## Key Files

- **`base64.ts`**: This file is crucial for the conversion processes between JSON and Base64. It ensures type safety and provides utility functions that are used throughout the application for data encoding and decoding.

- **`json-parser.ts`**: This file is important for parsing JSON data that may contain special values. It enhances the robustness of JSON parsing in the application by handling cases that standard JSON parsing would not support.

## Dependencies

- **`vitest`**: This testing framework is used for writing and running unit tests in the `__tests__` subdirectory. It helps ensure that the serialization and deserialization functions perform correctly and reliably.

## Configuration

There are no specific configuration files or environment variables used in this directory. The code relies on standard JavaScript and TypeScript functionalities for its operations.
