## High-level description

The target file `dereference.ts` contains a utility function `derefNotNull` that is designed to safely dereference a `React.RefObject` that should not be null. If the reference is null, it throws a `ReferenceError`. This function is particularly useful in React applications where references to DOM elements or components are used, ensuring that the reference is valid before accessing it.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in the code is the function `derefNotNull`. This function is standalone and does not depend on other symbols within the file. However, it is used in other parts of the codebase, such as in the `Cell.tsx` file, to ensure that references are not null before they are used.

## Symbols

### `derefNotNull`
#### Description
The `derefNotNull` function is a generic utility function that takes a `React.RefObject` as input and returns the current value of the reference if it is not null. If the reference is null, it throws a `ReferenceError`. This function is used to enforce non-nullability of references in a type-safe manner.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ref | `React.RefObject&lt;T | null&gt;` | A reference object that may contain a null or non-null value. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| value | `T` | The non-null value of the reference. |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function retrieves the current value of the reference using `ref.current`.
2. It checks if the value is `null`.
3. If the value is `null`, it throws a `ReferenceError` with a descriptive message.
4. If the value is not `null`, it returns the value.

## References

The `derefNotNull` function is referenced in the `Cell.tsx` file, where it is used to ensure that the `editorView` reference is not null before performing operations on it. This is crucial in scenarios where the reference is expected to be valid and non-null, such as when interacting with the CodeMirror editor view.

## Dependencies

The function does not have any external dependencies, but it relies on TypeScript's type system and React's `RefObject` for its functionality.

## Error Handling

The function handles errors by throwing a `ReferenceError` if the reference is null. This is a deliberate design choice to prevent null reference errors from propagating further into the application, which could lead to more complex bugs.

## Usage Example

In the `Cell.tsx` file, the `derefNotNull` function is used to safely access the `editorView` reference:

```typescript
const code = getEditorCodeAsPython(derefNotNull(editorView));
closeCompletion(derefNotNull(editorView));
```

In this context, `derefNotNull` ensures that `editorView` is not null before attempting to use it, thus preventing runtime errors related to null references.
