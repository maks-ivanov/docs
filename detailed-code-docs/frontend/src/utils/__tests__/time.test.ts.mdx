title: "time.test.ts"

## High-level description

The target file `time.test.ts` contains unit tests for the `Time` class, which is defined in the related file `time.ts`. These tests verify the functionality of creating `Time` instances from milliseconds and seconds, converting time to milliseconds and seconds, and obtaining the current time. The tests ensure that the `Time` class behaves as expected under various conditions, including handling null inputs.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `Time` class and its methods, which are tested using the `vitest` testing framework. The `Time` class provides static methods for creating instances from milliseconds and seconds, a method to get the current time, and methods to convert time to milliseconds and seconds. The test file uses `describe` and `it` blocks to organize and execute these tests.

## References

- `Milliseconds` and `Seconds` types: These are type aliases used to ensure type safety when dealing with time values.
- `Time` class: The main class being tested, which provides methods for time manipulation.
- `vitest` testing framework: Used for writing and executing the tests.

## Symbols

### `describe`
#### Description
`describe` is a function from the `vitest` testing framework used to group related tests together. It helps organize tests into suites, making them easier to read and manage.

### `it`
#### Description
`it` is a function from the `vitest` testing framework used to define individual test cases. Each `it` block contains a specific test scenario and assertions to verify the expected behavior.

### `expect`
#### Description
`expect` is a function from the `vitest` testing framework used to create assertions in test cases. It checks whether a given value meets certain conditions or expectations.

### `Time.fromMilliseconds`
#### Description
This static method creates a `Time` instance from a given number of milliseconds. If `null` is passed, it returns `null`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ms | Milliseconds \| null | The time in milliseconds or `null`. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| time | Time \| null | A `Time` instance or `null` if input is `null`. |

### `Time.fromSeconds`
#### Description
This static method creates a `Time` instance from a given number of seconds. If `null` is passed, it returns `null`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| s | Seconds \| null | The time in seconds or `null`. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| time | Time \| null | A `Time` instance or `null` if input is `null`. |

### `Time.now`
#### Description
This static method creates a `Time` instance representing the current time.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| time | Time | A `Time` instance representing the current time. |

### `Time.toMilliseconds`
#### Description
This method returns the time represented by the `Time` instance in milliseconds.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ms | Milliseconds | The time in milliseconds. |

### `Time.toSeconds`
#### Description
This method returns the time represented by the `Time` instance in seconds.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| s | Seconds | The time in seconds. |

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `vitest` | Used for writing and executing unit tests. |

## Error Handling

The `Time` class methods handle `null` inputs by returning `null`, ensuring that the methods do not throw errors when given invalid input.

## Logging

No logging mechanisms are implemented in the code.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
