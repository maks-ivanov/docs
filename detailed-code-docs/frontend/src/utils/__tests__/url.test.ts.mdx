title: "url.test.ts"

## High-level description

The target file `url.test.ts` contains unit tests for the `asURL` function, which is defined in the related file `url.ts`. The purpose of these tests is to ensure that the `asURL` function correctly resolves different types of paths (relative, absolute, full URLs, and query parameters) into complete URLs, taking into account the `document.baseURI` when it is set.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in the target file is the `describe` block, which organizes the tests for the `asURL` function. Within this block, there are nested `describe` blocks that differentiate between scenarios where `document.baseURI` is set and not set. Each scenario contains multiple `test` cases that verify the behavior of the `asURL` function with various input paths.

## References

- The `asURL` function from `url.ts` is the primary function being tested in this file.

## Symbols

### `describe("asURL function", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `asURL` function. It contains nested `describe` blocks to test different scenarios based on the state of `document.baseURI`.

### `describe("when document.baseURI is not set", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This block contains tests for the `asURL` function when `document.baseURI` is not set. It mocks `document.baseURI` to a default value of "https://example.com/" for testing purposes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| path | string | The path to be resolved into a URL. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | URL | The resolved URL based on the input path and `document.baseURI`. |

#### Internal Logic
- Mocks `document.baseURI` to "https://example.com/".
- Tests various path inputs to ensure they resolve correctly to full URLs.

### `describe("when document.baseURI is set", () =&gt; {...})`
#### Description
This block contains tests for the `asURL` function when `document.baseURI` is set to a specific value. It mocks `document.baseURI` to "https://example.com/base/" for testing purposes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| path | string | The path to be resolved into a URL. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | URL | The resolved URL based on the input path and `document.baseURI`. |

#### Internal Logic
- Mocks `document.baseURI` to "https://example.com/base/".
- Tests various path inputs to ensure they resolve correctly to full URLs, considering the base path.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `vitest` | Used for structuring and running the unit tests. |

## Error Handling

The tests do not explicitly handle errors, as they rely on the `expect` function from `vitest` to assert the correctness of the `asURL` function's output. If the function does not behave as expected, the test will fail, indicating an issue.

## Logging

There is no explicit logging in the test file. The test framework (`vitest`) handles output and reporting of test results.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
