## High-level description

The target file `routes.test.ts` contains unit tests for the `TinyRouter` class, specifically testing its `match` method. The tests verify that the `match` method correctly identifies and returns the appropriate route template for a given location, handles hash-based routes, and respects the order of nested routes.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in the code is the `TinyRouter` class, which is imported from the `routes.ts` file. The `TinyRouter` class is tested using the `vitest` testing framework, with the `describe` and `it` functions used to organize and define individual test cases.

## References

- `TinyRouter`: The class being tested, imported from `routes.ts`.
- `vitest`: The testing framework used to define and run the tests.

## Symbols

### `describe`
#### Description
The `describe` function is used to group related test cases together. In this file, it groups tests for the `TinyRouter.match` method.

### `it`
#### Description
The `it` function defines individual test cases. Each test case checks a specific behavior of the `TinyRouter.match` method.

### `expect`
#### Description
The `expect` function is used to assert that a value meets certain conditions. It is used in conjunction with matchers like `toEqual` and `toBe` to verify the outcomes of the `match` method.

### `TinyRouter.match`
#### Description
The `match` method of the `TinyRouter` class is tested to ensure it correctly matches a location to a route template.

#### Inputs
| Name     | Type     | Description                        |
|:---------|:---------|:-----------------------------------|
| location | Location | The location object to be matched. |

#### Outputs
| Name   | Type                                      | Description                                      |
|:-------|:------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| output | [Match&lt;ParamData&gt;, template: string] \| false | The matched route and template, or false if no match is found. |

#### Internal Logic
The `match` method iterates over the defined routes and uses the `pathFunction` to check if the location's hash or pathname matches any of the templates. If a match is found, it returns the match object and the template. If no match is found, it returns `false`.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose                                      |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------------|
| `vitest`   | Provides the testing framework for the unit tests. |

## Error Handling

The tests do not explicitly handle errors, as they rely on the `vitest` framework to report any assertion failures or exceptions that occur during test execution.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in the test file.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
