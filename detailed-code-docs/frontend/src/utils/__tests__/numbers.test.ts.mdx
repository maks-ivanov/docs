## High-level description

The target file `numbers.test.ts` contains unit tests for two utility functions, `prettyNumber` and `prettyScientificNumber`, which are defined in the related file `numbers.ts`. These functions are designed to format numbers into more human-readable strings, with `prettyNumber` focusing on standard number formatting and `prettyScientificNumber` handling both standard and scientific notation based on the magnitude of the number.

## Code Structure

The test file uses the `vitest` testing framework to define test suites and test cases for the two functions. Each function has its own `describe` block, which contains multiple `it` blocks to test different scenarios and edge cases.

## References

- `prettyNumber`: A function from `numbers.ts` that formats numbers with commas and up to two decimal places.
- `prettyScientificNumber`: A function from `numbers.ts` that formats numbers using scientific notation when appropriate.

## Symbols

### `describe`
#### Description
`describe` is a function from the `vitest` testing framework used to group related test cases. It helps organize tests into suites, making it easier to understand and maintain the test code.

### `expect`
#### Description
`expect` is a function from the `vitest` testing framework used to assert that a value meets certain conditions. It is used in conjunction with matchers like `toBe` to verify the output of the functions being tested.

### `it`
#### Description
`it` is a function from the `vitest` testing framework used to define individual test cases. Each `it` block contains a specific scenario or condition that the function under test should satisfy.

### `prettyNumber`
#### Description
The `prettyNumber` function formats a given number, string, or boolean into a human-readable string with commas as thousand separators and up to two decimal places.

#### Inputs
| Name  | Type                      | Description                                      |
|:------|:--------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| value | number \| string \| undefined \| null \| boolean | The value to be formatted. |

#### Outputs
| Name   | Type   | Description                        |
|:-------|:-------|:-----------------------------------|
| result | string | The formatted number as a string.  |

#### Internal Logic
- If the input is `undefined` or `null`, it returns an empty string.
- If the input is a string, it returns the string as is.
- If the input is a boolean, it converts it to a string.
- For numbers, it uses `toLocaleString` to format the number with commas and up to two decimal places.

### `prettyScientificNumber`
#### Description
The `prettyScientificNumber` function formats a number into a string, using scientific notation for very small or very large numbers, while formatting others with commas and up to two decimal places.

#### Inputs
| Name  | Type   | Description                        |
|:------|:-------|:-----------------------------------|
| value | number | The number to be formatted.        |

#### Outputs
| Name   | Type   | Description                        |
|:-------|:-------|:-----------------------------------|
| result | string | The formatted number as a string.  |

#### Internal Logic
- Handles special cases for `0`, `NaN`, and infinity.
- Uses scientific notation for numbers less than `0.01` or greater than or equal to `1,000,000`.
- For other numbers, it formats them with commas and up to two decimal places.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose                                      |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------------|
| `vitest`   | Used for defining and running unit tests.    |

## Error Handling

The test file does not explicitly handle errors, as it relies on the `vitest` framework to manage test failures and exceptions.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in the test file.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
