## High-level description

The target file `id-tree.test.ts` contains a suite of unit tests for the `CollapsibleTree` class, which is a data structure designed to manage a tree of nodes that can be collapsed and expanded. The tests verify the correct initialization, manipulation, and behavior of the tree, including operations like collapsing, expanding, moving, inserting, deleting nodes, and checking node properties.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `TreeNode` and `CollapsibleTree` classes, which are defined in the related file `id-tree.tsx`. The `TreeNode` class represents individual nodes in the tree, while the `CollapsibleTree` class manages a collection of these nodes and provides methods for manipulating the tree structure. The test file uses the `vitest` testing framework to define and run tests on the `CollapsibleTree` class.

## References

- `TreeNode`: Represents a node in the tree with a value, a collapsed state, and potential children.
- `CollapsibleTree`: Manages a collection of `TreeNode` instances and provides methods for tree operations.
- `vitest`: A testing framework used to define and execute the tests.

## Symbols

### `describe`
#### Description
Defines a test suite for the `CollapsibleTree` class, grouping related tests together.

### `beforeEach`
#### Description
Sets up the initial state for each test by creating a new `CollapsibleTree` instance with a predefined set of nodes.

### `it`
#### Description
Defines individual test cases within the `CollapsibleTree` test suite. Each test case checks a specific functionality or behavior of the `CollapsibleTree`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| description | string | A description of the test case. |
| testFunction | function | The function containing the test logic. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | None | The function does not return a value but may throw errors if assertions fail. |

#### Internal Logic
Each `it` block contains assertions that verify the expected behavior of the `CollapsibleTree` methods. These assertions use the `expect` function to compare actual outcomes with expected results.

## Side Effects

- The `beforeEach` function modifies the global `tree` variable to reset the state before each test.
- The `it` blocks may throw errors if the assertions fail, indicating a test failure.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `vitest` | Provides the testing framework and functions like `describe`, `it`, `expect`, and `beforeEach`. |

## Error Handling

The tests include error handling by using `expect` to assert that certain operations throw specific errors. This is used to verify that the `CollapsibleTree` class correctly handles invalid operations, such as attempting to collapse a non-existent node or collapsing an already collapsed node.

## Logging

The related `id-tree.tsx` file uses a `Logger` to warn about certain conditions, such as when a node is not found. However, the test file itself does not implement logging.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
