## High-level description

The target file `path.test.ts` contains unit tests for the `Paths` utility object and the `PathBuilder` class, which are defined in the related file `paths.ts`. These tests verify the functionality of path manipulation methods such as checking if a path is absolute, extracting directory names, base names, and file extensions, as well as joining paths using different delimiters.

## Code Structure

The code is structured into two main parts: tests for the `Paths` object and tests for the `PathBuilder` class. Each part contains multiple test cases that validate the behavior of specific methods. The `Paths` object provides static methods for common path operations, while the `PathBuilder` class offers an instance-based approach to path manipulation, allowing for the use of different path delimiters.

## References

- `Paths` and `PathBuilder` are imported from `../paths`, which is the related file `paths.ts`.
- `FilePath` is a type alias for a `TypedString` with the type "FilePath", also defined in `paths.ts`.

## Symbols

### `Paths`
#### Description
The `Paths` object provides static methods for handling file paths, including checking if a path is absolute, extracting directory names, base names, and file extensions, and determining the rest of a path relative to a root.

#### Methods
- `isAbsolute(path: string): boolean`: Checks if a given path is absolute.
- `dirname(path: string): string`: Returns the directory name of a given path.
- `basename(path: string): string`: Returns the last part of a path.
- `rest(path: string, root: string): string`: Returns the suffix of a path relative to a root path.
- `extension(filename: string): string`: Returns the file extension of a given filename.

### `PathBuilder`
#### Description
The `PathBuilder` class provides methods for constructing and manipulating file paths using a specified delimiter, either "/" or "\\".

#### Constructor
- `constructor(deliminator: "/" | "\\")`: Initializes a `PathBuilder` instance with a specified delimiter.

#### Methods
- `static guessDeliminator(path: string): PathBuilder`: Determines the appropriate delimiter for a given path and returns a `PathBuilder` instance.
- `join(...paths: string[]): FilePath`: Joins multiple path segments into a single path using the instance's delimiter.
- `basename(path: FilePath): FilePath`: Returns the last part of a path.
- `rest(path: FilePath, root: FilePath): FilePath`: Returns the suffix of a path relative to a root path.
- `dirname(path: FilePath): FilePath`: Returns the directory name of a given path.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `vitest`   | Used for writing and running unit tests. |

## Error Handling

The test file does not explicitly handle errors, as it relies on the testing framework `vitest` to manage assertions and report failures.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in the test file.

## API/Interface Reference

The test file does not expose any API or public interface. It is solely for testing purposes.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
