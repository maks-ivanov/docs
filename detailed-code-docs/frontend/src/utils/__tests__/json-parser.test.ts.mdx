## High-level description

The target file `json-parser.test.ts` contains unit tests for the `jsonParseWithSpecialChar` function, which is designed to parse JSON strings that may include special values like `NaN`, `Infinity`, and `-Infinity`. The tests ensure that the function correctly handles these special cases, as well as standard JSON parsing scenarios, and verifies its behavior when parsing fails.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in this file is the `it` function from the `vitest` testing framework, which is used to define individual test cases. Each test case calls the `jsonParseWithSpecialChar` function with different inputs to verify its correctness. The `expect` function is used to assert that the output of `jsonParseWithSpecialChar` matches the expected result.

## References

- `jsonParseWithSpecialChar`: This function is imported from `../json/json-parser` and is the primary focus of the tests in this file.

## Symbols

### `it`
#### Description
The `it` function is used to define a test case. Each test case checks a specific aspect of the `jsonParseWithSpecialChar` function's behavior.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| description | string | A description of the test case. |
| testFunction | function | A function containing the test logic. |

#### Outputs
None. The function is used for its side effects of running tests.

#### Internal Logic
Each `it` block contains a series of `expect` statements that call `jsonParseWithSpecialChar` with various inputs and compare the results to expected values using `toEqual` or `toMatchInlineSnapshot`.

## Side Effects

- The tests do not have side effects beyond verifying the behavior of `jsonParseWithSpecialChar`.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `vitest` | Provides the testing framework used to define and run the tests. |

## Error Handling

The tests include cases where `jsonParseWithSpecialChar` is expected to fail, such as when parsing an empty string or `undefined`. These cases use `toMatchInlineSnapshot` to verify that the function returns an empty object `{}` in these scenarios.

## Logging

No explicit logging is implemented in the test file. The `vitest` framework handles test output and reporting.

## TODOs

No TODOs or notes are present in the code.
