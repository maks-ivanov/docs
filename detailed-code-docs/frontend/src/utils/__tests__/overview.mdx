## High-level description

The directory contains a suite of unit tests for various utility functions and classes used in a frontend application. These tests are designed to ensure the correctness and reliability of utility modules that handle tasks such as blob serialization, reducer creation, file name manipulation, tree data structure management, JSON parsing, number formatting, path manipulation, routing, time management, URL resolution, and WebSocket connection handling. The tests are implemented using the `vitest` testing framework, which provides a structured environment for writing and executing test cases.

## What does it do?

The tests in this directory verify the functionality of utility functions and classes by simulating different scenarios and checking the outputs against expected results. For example:

- **Blob Serialization and Deserialization**: Tests ensure that `Blob` objects can be serialized to base64 strings and deserialized back to `Blob` objects with the same content.
- **Reducer Creation**: Tests validate the creation of reducers and actions, ensuring they work correctly with state management patterns.
- **File Name Manipulation**: Tests check that file names can be converted to different formats and have their extensions removed.
- **Tree Data Structure**: Tests verify the operations of a collapsible tree structure, including node manipulation and property checks.
- **JSON Parsing**: Tests ensure that JSON strings with special characters are parsed correctly.
- **Number Formatting**: Tests validate the formatting of numbers into human-readable strings, including scientific notation.
- **Path Manipulation**: Tests check the functionality of path operations, such as joining paths and extracting components.
- **Routing**: Tests ensure that the `TinyRouter` class correctly matches routes based on location.
- **Time Management**: Tests verify the creation and conversion of time instances.
- **URL Resolution**: Tests ensure that paths are correctly resolved into full URLs, considering the base URI.
- **WebSocket Connection**: Tests validate the behavior of establishing WebSocket connections, ensuring correct handling of successful and failed attempts.

Each test case is designed to cover specific aspects of the utility functions, ensuring they behave as expected under various conditions. The use of `vitest` allows for clear organization and execution of these tests, providing feedback on any failures or issues.
