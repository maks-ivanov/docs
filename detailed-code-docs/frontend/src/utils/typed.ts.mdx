## High-level description

The target file `typed.ts` defines TypeScript utility types that are used to create strongly typed identifiers for numbers and strings. These types are used to distinguish between different logical types of numbers and strings at compile time, without affecting runtime behavior. Additionally, it defines a utility type for objects that have an identifier.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are `TypedNumber`, `TypedString`, and `Identified`. These are TypeScript type definitions that are used to enforce type safety and clarity in the codebase. They are used in other parts of the codebase to create specific types like `CellId`, `SessionId`, `RequestId`, etc.

## Symbols

### `TypedNumber&lt;T&gt;`
#### Description
`TypedNumber&lt;T&gt;` is a TypeScript type that represents a number with an associated type `T`. It is used to distinguish between different types of numbers at compile time.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| T    | Type | The type to associate with the number. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | number & { __type__: T } | A number with an associated type `T`. |

### `TypedString&lt;T&gt;`
#### Description
`TypedString&lt;T&gt;` is a TypeScript type that represents a string with an associated type `T`. It is used to distinguish between different types of strings at compile time.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| T    | Type | The type to associate with the string. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | string & { __type__: T } | A string with an associated type `T`. |

### `Identified&lt;T&gt;`
#### Description
`Identified&lt;T&gt;` is a TypeScript type that represents an object with an `id` property of type `string`, combined with the properties of type `T`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| T    | Type | The type to combine with an `id` property. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | { id: string } & T | An object with an `id` and properties of type `T`. |

## References

- `TypedString` is used in various parts of the codebase to create specific string types like `CellId`, `SessionId`, `RequestId`, etc.
- `Identified` is used in the `state.ts` file to create objects with unique identifiers.

## Dependencies

There are no external dependencies in this file. The types defined here are used internally within the codebase to enforce type safety.

## Error Handling

There is no error handling in this file as it only defines TypeScript types, which are used at compile time and do not affect runtime behavior.

## Logging

There is no logging in this file as it only defines TypeScript types.

## API/Interface Reference

This file does not define any APIs or interfaces. It provides utility types for use in other parts of the codebase.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
