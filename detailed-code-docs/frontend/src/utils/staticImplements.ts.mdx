## High-level description
The `staticImplements` function in the target file is a TypeScript utility designed to enforce static interface implementation in classes. It provides a way to ensure that a class adheres to a specific static contract, which is not natively supported by TypeScript.

## Code Structure
The `staticImplements` function is a generic function that returns a decorator. This decorator can be applied to a class to enforce that it implements a static interface, which is a pattern used to simulate static type checking for class-level properties and methods.

## Symbols

### `staticImplements`
#### Description
The `staticImplements` function is a TypeScript utility that acts as a decorator to enforce static interface implementation on classes. It is a workaround to ensure that a class meets the requirements of a static interface, which TypeScript does not natively support.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| T | Type Parameter | Represents the static interface that the class should implement. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | Function | A decorator function that can be applied to a class. |

#### Internal Logic
The function returns a decorator that takes a class constructor as an argument. The decorator does not modify the class but serves as a type-checking mechanism to ensure that the class implements the static interface `T`. The use of `U extends T` ensures that the class constructor `U` satisfies the static interface `T`.

## References
The `staticImplements` function does not directly reference other parts of the codebase but is a utility that can be used in conjunction with other TypeScript code to enforce static interface contracts.

## Dependencies
There are no external dependencies in the `staticImplements` function. It is a standalone utility that leverages TypeScript's type system.

## Error Handling
The `staticImplements` function does not include any error handling mechanisms. It relies on TypeScript's type system to enforce constraints at compile time.

## Logging
There are no logging mechanisms implemented in the `staticImplements` function.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
