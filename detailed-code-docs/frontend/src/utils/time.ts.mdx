## High-level description

The `time.ts` file provides a utility class `Time` for handling time-related operations in a TypeScript application. It defines types for representing time in milliseconds and seconds, and offers methods to convert between these units, create `Time` instances from current time, and handle null values gracefully.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `Milliseconds` and `Seconds` types, and the `Time` class. The `Time` class provides static methods for creating instances from milliseconds or seconds, and a method to get the current time. It also includes instance methods to convert the stored time to milliseconds or seconds.

## Symbols

### `Milliseconds`
#### Description
A type alias for a number that represents time in milliseconds, with a unique type identifier to distinguish it from regular numbers.

### `Seconds`
#### Description
A type alias for a number that represents time in seconds, with a unique type identifier to distinguish it from regular numbers.

### `Time`
#### Description
The `Time` class encapsulates a time value in milliseconds and provides methods to create `Time` instances from milliseconds or seconds, convert between these units, and obtain the current time.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ms | Milliseconds | Time value in milliseconds for the constructor and `fromMilliseconds` method. |
| s | Seconds | Time value in seconds for the `fromSeconds` method. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Time instance | Time | A new instance of the `Time` class. |
| Milliseconds | Milliseconds | The time value in milliseconds. |
| Seconds | Seconds | The time value in seconds. |

#### Internal Logic
- **Constructor**: Private, stores the time in milliseconds.
- **fromMilliseconds**: Static method that returns a `Time` instance from a given milliseconds value or null if the input is null.
- **fromSeconds**: Static method that converts seconds to milliseconds and returns a `Time` instance or null if the input is null.
- **now**: Static method that returns a `Time` instance representing the current time.
- **toMilliseconds**: Returns the stored time in milliseconds.
- **toSeconds**: Converts the stored milliseconds to seconds and returns the value.

## References

- The `Time` class is used in various parts of the codebase, such as in the `CellStatusComponent` and `useElapsedTime` hook, to manage and display elapsed time.
- The `Milliseconds` and `Seconds` types are used to ensure type safety when dealing with time values across the application.

## Dependencies

No external libraries or modules are directly used in this file.

## Error Handling

The methods `fromMilliseconds` and `fromSeconds` handle null inputs by returning null, ensuring that the application can gracefully handle cases where time values might be missing.

## Logging

No logging mechanisms are implemented in this file.

## TODOs

No TODOs or notes are present in the code.
