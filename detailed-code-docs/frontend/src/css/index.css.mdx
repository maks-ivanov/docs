## High-level description

The `index.css` file in the `frontend/src/css` directory serves as a central stylesheet that imports various other CSS files. These imported stylesheets provide global styles, syntax highlighting, mathematical typesetting, markdown formatting, and table styling for the frontend of a web application. By consolidating these imports, `index.css` ensures that all necessary styles are applied consistently across the application.

## Code Structure

The `index.css` file is structured as a series of `@import` statements, each referencing a different CSS file. These files are:

- `globals.css`: Likely contains global styles and variables used throughout the application.
- `codehilite.css`: Provides styles for syntax highlighting, particularly for code blocks.
- `common.css`: Presumably includes common styles shared across different components or pages.
- `katex-fonts.css` and `katex.min.css`: Include styles for rendering mathematical expressions using the KaTeX library.
- `md.css`: Contains styles for rendering markdown content.
- `admonition.css`: Provides styles for special content blocks like warnings, tips, or notes.
- `table.css`: Styles tables, ensuring they are responsive and visually consistent.

## References

The `index.css` file references several other CSS files within the same directory. These files define specific styles that are crucial for the appearance and functionality of the web application.

## Symbols

### `@import`
#### Description
The `@import` rule is used to include external CSS files into the current stylesheet. This allows for modularization of styles, making it easier to manage and maintain the CSS codebase.

#### Inputs

|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| url | string | The URL or path to the CSS file to be imported. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | N/A | The `@import` rule does not produce a direct output but includes the styles from the specified file. |

## Dependencies

The `index.css` file depends on the following CSS files:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `globals.css` | Provides global styles and variables. |
| `codehilite.css` | Styles for syntax highlighting. |
| `common.css` | Common styles shared across components. |
| `katex-fonts.css` and `katex.min.css` | Styles for rendering mathematical expressions with KaTeX. |
| `md.css` | Styles for markdown content. |
| `admonition.css` | Styles for special content blocks like warnings and tips. |
| `table.css` | Styles for tables, ensuring responsiveness and consistency. |

## Error Handling

There is no explicit error handling in the `index.css` file, as it primarily consists of `@import` statements. Any issues with importing styles would typically manifest as missing or incorrect styles in the rendered application.

## Logging

There is no logging mechanism implemented in the `index.css` file, as it is a CSS file and does not execute code that would require logging.

## API/Interface Reference

The `index.css` file does not expose an API or interface, as it is a stylesheet used for styling the frontend of a web application. Its purpose is to ensure that all necessary styles are applied consistently across the application by importing various CSS files.
