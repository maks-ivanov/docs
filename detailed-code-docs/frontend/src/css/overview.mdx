## High-level description

The `frontend/src/css` directory is a collection of CSS stylesheets that define the visual presentation and layout of a web application's frontend components. These stylesheets ensure consistent styling across different parts of the application, including global styles, component-specific styles, syntax highlighting, mathematical typesetting, markdown formatting, and table styling. The directory also includes styles for responsive design, print optimization, and font management.

## What does it do?

The stylesheets in this directory collectively manage the visual appearance of the web application. They define how elements are displayed on the screen, how they respond to user interactions, and how they adapt to different screen sizes and print formats. For example:

- **Global Styles**: `globals.css` sets up a consistent theme using CSS variables for colors, fonts, and shadows, and applies base styles to HTML elements.
- **Component Styles**: Files like `App.css`, `Cell.css`, and `Header.css` provide detailed styling for specific components, ensuring they look and behave consistently.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: `codehilite.css` styles code blocks with syntax highlighting, using a color scheme inspired by popular themes.
- **Mathematical Typesetting**: `katex-fonts.css` and `katex.min.css` provide styles for rendering mathematical expressions using the KaTeX library.
- **Markdown Formatting**: `md.css` styles markdown content, ensuring consistent presentation and alignment, especially when used inside interactive elements.
- **Table Styling**: `table.css` defines styles for tables, ensuring they are responsive and visually consistent.

## Entry points

The main entry point for styling in this directory is `index.css`, which imports and integrates styles from other CSS files like `globals.css`, `codehilite.css`, `common.css`, `katex-fonts.css`, `katex.min.css`, `md.css`, `admonition.css`, and `table.css`. This file serves as the central hub for managing the application's overall styling, ensuring that all components and elements are styled consistently.

## Key Files

- **`App.css`**: The central stylesheet that imports other CSS files and defines global styles, responsive design rules, and specific styles for various UI elements.
- **`admonition.css`**: Styles various types of admonition blocks used to highlight important information, warnings, tips, and other messages.
- **`codehilite.css`**: Provides styles for syntax highlighting, particularly for code blocks.
- **`common.css`**: Includes common styles shared across different components or pages, focusing on hover actions.
- **`globals.css`**: Defines global styles and variables for both light and dark themes, ensuring consistent styling across the application.
- **`katex-fonts.css` and `katex.min.css`**: Include styles for rendering mathematical expressions using the KaTeX library.
- **`md.css`**: Contains styles for rendering markdown content.
- **`table.css`**: Styles tables, ensuring they are responsive and visually consistent.

## Dependencies

The directory relies on several CSS files that are imported into `index.css` to provide a consistent styling framework. These include:

- **`@radix-ui/colors`**: Provides a set of color themes for both light and dark modes.
- **`@tailwindcss`**: Provides utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **`lucide.dev`**: Provides SVG icons used in the admonition blocks.

Additionally, the stylesheets use CSS variables extensively for colors, shadows, and dimensions, allowing for easy customization and theming. These variables are likely defined elsewhere in the application's CSS files.
