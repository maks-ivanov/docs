## High-level description
The CSS file `common.css` defines styles for hover actions, specifically targeting devices that support hover interactions. It includes rules to hide or display elements with the class `hover-action` based on user interactions such as hover or focus, and also considers the state of child elements within a parent.

## Code Structure
The CSS rules are structured to apply styles conditionally based on media queries and pseudo-classes. The main focus is on elements with the class `hover-action` and their parent elements with the class `hover-actions-parent`.

## Symbols

### `.hover-action`
#### Description
The `.hover-action` class is used to define elements that should be displayed when a user hovers over or focuses on them. The styles are applied conditionally based on the device's capability to detect hover actions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| hover | pseudo-class | Applies when the user hovers over the element. |
| focus | pseudo-class | Applies when the element is focused. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| display | CSS property | Sets the display style to `inline-flex` when hovered or focused. |

#### Internal Logic
- The `.hover-action` class is initially hidden on devices that support hover and have a fine pointer, using a media query.
- When the element is hovered over or focused, it is displayed as `inline-flex`.

### `.hover-actions-parent`
#### Description
The `.hover-actions-parent` class is used for parent elements that contain `.hover-action` elements. It ensures that child elements with the `.hover-action` class are displayed when the parent is hovered over, focused, or contains a child with an open state.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| hover | pseudo-class | Applies when the user hovers over the parent element. |
| focus | pseudo-class | Applies when the parent element is focused. |
| data-state | attribute | Checks if any child element has a `data-state` attribute set to "open". |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| display | CSS property | Sets the display style to `inline-flex` for child `.hover-action` elements. |

#### Internal Logic
- When the parent element is hovered over or focused, all child elements with the `.hover-action` class are displayed as `inline-flex`.
- If any child element within the parent has a `data-state` attribute set to "open", the `.hover-action` elements are also displayed.
