title: "fonts.css"
---

## High-level description
The `fonts.css` file defines custom font-face rules for a web application, specifying the fonts to be used, their styles, weights, and sources. It ensures that the fonts are loaded from local paths within the project, which are likely to be used in the application's static HTML downloads, while also maintaining compatibility with Google Fonts CDN.

## Code Structure
The file consists of multiple `@font-face` declarations, each defining a specific font family, style, weight, and source file. These declarations are used to load custom fonts into the application, allowing for consistent typography across different parts of the application.

### `@font-face`
#### Description
The `@font-face` rule is used to define a custom font that can be used within the application. It specifies the font's family name, style, weight, display strategy, and the source URL from which the font file can be loaded.

#### Inputs
| Name         | Type   | Description                                                                 |
|:-------------|:-------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| font-family  | string | The name of the font family to be used in the application.                  |
| font-style   | string | The style of the font (e.g., normal, italic).                               |
| font-weight  | number | The weight of the font (e.g., 400 for normal, 700 for bold).                |
| font-display | string | The display strategy for the font (e.g., block, swap).                      |
| src          | string | The URL to the font file, specifying the format (e.g., truetype).          |

#### Outputs
There are no direct outputs from the `@font-face` rule, but it enables the specified fonts to be used throughout the application's CSS.

#### Internal Logic
Each `@font-face` rule specifies a unique combination of font-family, style, weight, and source URL. The browser uses these rules to load the appropriate font files when rendering text in the application.

## References
- The comment at the top of the file references `frontend/src/core/static/download-html.ts`, indicating that the fonts defined here must be kept in sync with those used in the static HTML download feature.

## Dependencies
The file relies on the presence of font files located at specific paths within the project directory. These files must be correctly placed for the fonts to load properly.

## Side Effects
The `@font-face` rules affect the typography of the application by loading and applying custom fonts to text elements.

## Performance Considerations
Using local font files can improve performance by reducing the dependency on external resources like Google Fonts CDN, especially if the fonts are used frequently across the application. However, it requires ensuring that the font files are correctly included and accessible in the project's directory structure.

## TODOs
- The comment suggests that the fonts should be kept in sync with those used in the static HTML download, indicating a potential area for regular updates or checks to ensure consistency.
