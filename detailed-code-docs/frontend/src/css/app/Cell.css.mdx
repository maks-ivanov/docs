## High-level description

The `Cell.css` file defines the styling for a component referred to as "Cell" in a frontend application. This component can exist in various states such as interactive, stale, error, disabled, and more. The CSS file provides detailed styling rules for each of these states, including hover, focus, and other interactive behaviors, as well as specific styles for dark mode and when the application is disconnected.

## Code Structure

The CSS file is structured around the `.Cell` class, which is the main component being styled. Various states and sub-elements of the Cell are styled using class selectors and pseudo-classes. The file also includes styles for related elements like `.output-area`, `.console-output-area`, and `.cm-editor`, which are likely subcomponents or related components within the Cell.

## Symbols

### `.Cell`
#### Description
The `.Cell` class is the primary class for styling a cell component. It includes styles for positioning, border, shadow, and various interactive states like focus and hover.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | This is a CSS class, so it doesn't take inputs in the traditional sense. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A  | N/A  | This is a CSS class, so it doesn't produce outputs in the traditional sense. |

#### Internal Logic
- The `.Cell` class sets the basic layout properties such as `position`, `border-radius`, and `box-shadow`.
- It uses CSS variables for shadows and colors, allowing for easy theming and customization.
- The class includes pseudo-classes like `:focus-visible`, `:focus-within`, and `:hover` to manage different interactive states.
- It applies different styles based on additional classes like `.interactive`, `.stale`, `.disabled`, `.needs-run`, `.has-error`, `.focus-outline`, and `.published`.

### `.interactive`
#### Description
Styles for the Cell when it is in an interactive state, typically when the user is editing or interacting with the cell.

#### Internal Logic
- Limits the height of output areas and enables scrolling.
- Adjusts border-radius for child elements.
- Changes box-shadow on hover and focus.

### `.stale`
#### Description
Styles for the Cell when it is in a stale state, indicating that the content may be outdated.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets a background color and reduces opacity for certain sub-elements to indicate staleness.

### `.disabled`
#### Description
Styles for the Cell when it is disabled, preventing user interaction.

#### Internal Logic
- Applies a lighter shadow and reduces opacity for sub-elements.
- Ensures that focus styles are still applied for accessibility.

### `.needs-run`
#### Description
Styles for the Cell when it requires execution or an update.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses specific shadows to indicate the need for action.
- Makes the `.RunButton` visible.

### `.has-error`
#### Description
Styles for the Cell when it contains an error.

#### Internal Logic
- Applies a red outline and specific shadows to indicate an error state.
- Adjusts styles on hover and focus to maintain error visibility.

### `.focus-outline`
#### Description
Styles for the Cell when it is focused, providing a visual indication of focus.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses transitions and custom shadows to highlight the focused state.

### `.published`
#### Description
Styles for the Cell when it is in a published state, typically when only the output is visible.

#### Internal Logic
- Removes borders and shadows to simplify the appearance.
- Adjusts padding and display properties for the output area.

### `.shoulder-right` and `.shoulder-bottom`
#### Description
Styles for additional UI elements positioned around the Cell, likely for buttons or controls.

#### Internal Logic
- Positions these elements absolutely relative to the Cell.
- Sets display properties and z-index to ensure they are visible and correctly layered.

### `.tray`
#### Description
Styles for a tray element associated with the Cell, possibly for additional controls or information.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses flexbox for layout and adjusts border-radius for child editors.
- Expands the hover area using pseudo-elements.

## Dependencies

The file uses CSS variables and utility classes from a broader CSS framework, likely Tailwind CSS, as indicated by the `@apply` directive. It also references other CSS files like `App.css` and `codemirror.css` for additional styles and resets.

## Configuration

The file uses CSS variables extensively for colors, shadows, and dimensions, allowing for easy customization and theming. These variables are likely defined in a global stylesheet or a CSS framework configuration.

## Error Handling

The file includes specific styles for error states, using classes like `.has-error` and `.error-outline` to visually indicate when a Cell is in an error state.

## Logging

There is no logging mechanism implemented in this CSS file, as it is purely for styling purposes.

## TODOs

- There is a TODO comment regarding finding a way to accommodate large elements in the `.output-area` without breaking margin collapse, indicating a potential area for future improvement.
