## Dependencies

The `codemirror.css` file is imported into the main application stylesheet `App.css`, as seen in the related code snippet. This integration ensures that the styles defined in `codemirror.css` are applied to the CodeMirror editor within the broader context of the application's styling.

## Configuration

The stylesheet uses CSS variables for colors and sizes, such as `--gray-10`, `--light-shadow`, and `--sky-11`, which are likely defined elsewhere in the application's CSS files. These variables allow for easy theme adjustments and maintain consistency across different components.

## Error Handling

There is no explicit error handling in a CSS file, as CSS is a declarative language focused on styling rather than logic or error management.

## Logging

CSS files do not include logging mechanisms, as they are used solely for styling purposes.
