## High-level description

The `reset.css` file in the `frontend/src/css/app/` directory is a CSS stylesheet that sets some basic styles for the HTML elements in a web application. It primarily focuses on setting font properties for the `body` and `code` elements and defining the layout for the `#root` element. This file is likely used to ensure a consistent base style across different browsers by resetting or normalizing default styles.

## Code Structure

The `reset.css` file contains CSS rules that apply to the `body`, `#root`, and `code` elements. These rules are likely imported and used in other CSS files to maintain a consistent styling baseline across the application.

## Symbols

### `body`
#### Description
The `body` selector applies styles to the entire body of the HTML document. It sets the font family using a CSS variable, and applies font smoothing techniques for better text rendering across different browsers.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `--text-font` | CSS Variable | The font family to be used for the body text. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `font-family` | CSS Property | Sets the font family for the body text. |
| `-webkit-font-smoothing` | CSS Property | Enhances the appearance of text in WebKit-based browsers. |
| `-moz-osx-font-smoothing` | CSS Property | Enhances the appearance of text in Firefox on macOS. |

### `#root`
#### Description
The `#root` selector applies styles to the root element of the application, typically a `div` with the id `root`. It sets the element to take the full width of its container, display as a flex container, and ensures it occupies at least the full height of the viewport.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `width` | CSS Property | Sets the width to 100% of the container. |
| `display` | CSS Property | Sets the display to flex for flexible box layout. |
| `flex-direction` | CSS Property | Sets the direction of flex items to column. |
| `min-height` | CSS Property | Ensures the element is at least the height of the viewport. |

### `code`
#### Description
The `code` selector applies styles to inline code elements, setting the font family to a monospace font using a CSS variable.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `--monospace-font` | CSS Variable | The font family to be used for code elements. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `font-family` | CSS Property | Sets the font family for code elements to a monospace font. |

## References

The `reset.css` file is imported in `App.css`, as seen in the related code snippet. This indicates that the styles defined in `reset.css` are applied as a base layer before additional styles are added in `App.css` and other CSS files.

## Dependencies

The file uses CSS variables (`--text-font` and `--monospace-font`) which are likely defined elsewhere in the application's CSS, possibly in a global or root stylesheet.

## Error Handling

There is no error handling in CSS files as they are declarative stylesheets. Any issues with CSS would typically manifest as visual discrepancies in the rendered web page.

## Logging

There is no logging mechanism in CSS files.

## API/Interface Reference

The `reset.css` file does not define an API or interface, as it is a stylesheet used for styling purposes.
