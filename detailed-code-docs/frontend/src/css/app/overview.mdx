## High-level description

The `frontend/src/css/app/` directory contains CSS stylesheets that define the visual presentation and layout of a web application's frontend components. These stylesheets are responsible for ensuring consistent styling across different parts of the application, including the main application container, specific components like cells and headers, and the CodeMirror text editor. The directory also includes styles for responsive design, print optimization, and font management.

## What does it do?

The stylesheets in this directory collectively manage the visual appearance of the web application. They define how elements are displayed on the screen, how they respond to user interactions, and how they adapt to different screen sizes and print formats. For example, `App.css` sets global styles and imports other CSS files to ensure a cohesive look and feel. `Cell.css` provides detailed styling for interactive components called "Cells," which can exist in various states like interactive, stale, or error. `Header.css` styles the header section, including animations for app icons and layout adjustments for keyboard shortcuts. `codemirror.css` customizes the appearance of the CodeMirror editor, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing interface. `fonts.css` defines custom fonts to be used throughout the application, while `print.css` optimizes the layout for printing. Finally, `reset.css` sets a baseline for styles to ensure consistency across different browsers.

## Entry points

The main entry point for styling in this directory is `App.css`, which imports and integrates styles from other CSS files like `reset.css`, `Cell.css`, `codemirror.css`, `fonts.css`, `Header.css`, and `print.css`. This file serves as the central hub for managing the application's overall styling, ensuring that all components and elements are styled consistently.

## Key Files

- **`App.css`**: The central stylesheet that imports other CSS files and defines global styles, responsive design rules, and specific styles for various UI elements.
- **`Cell.css`**: Styles the "Cell" component, handling various states and interactive behaviors, including dark mode and disconnected states.
- **`Header.css`**: Styles the header section, including animations for app icons and layout adjustments for keyboard shortcuts.
- **`codemirror.css`**: Customizes the appearance of the CodeMirror editor, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing interface.
- **`fonts.css`**: Defines custom fonts to be used throughout the application, ensuring consistent typography.
- **`print.css`**: Optimizes the layout for printing, hiding unnecessary elements and adjusting layout properties for full-page printing.
- **`reset.css`**: Sets a baseline for styles to ensure consistency across different browsers by resetting or normalizing default styles.

## Dependencies

The directory relies on several CSS files that are imported into `App.css` to provide a consistent styling framework. These include:

- **`reset.css`**: Resets default browser styles for consistency.
- **`Cell.css`**: Styles for cell components.
- **`codemirror.css`**: Styles for the CodeMirror editor.
- **`fonts.css`**: Font definitions for the application.
- **`Header.css`**: Styles for the header component.
- **`print.css`**: Styles for print-specific scenarios.

Additionally, the stylesheets use CSS variables extensively for colors, shadows, and dimensions, allowing for easy customization and theming. These variables are likely defined elsewhere in the application's CSS files.
