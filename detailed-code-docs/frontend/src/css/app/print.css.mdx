## High-level description

The `print.css` file is a CSS stylesheet designed to optimize the appearance of a web application when printed. It includes rules to hide certain elements, adjust layout properties for full-page printing, and ensure that printed content is displayed correctly without unnecessary visual effects like shadows. The stylesheet also includes media queries specifically for print, allowing for adjustments to be made only when the content is being printed.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are CSS selectors and rules that apply styles to HTML elements. These rules are organized to target specific elements and classes, particularly when the document is in a printing state. The stylesheet uses a combination of class-based selectors (e.g., `.no-print`, `.printing-output`) and element-based selectors (e.g., `body`, `h1`, `article`) to apply styles conditionally based on the context (e.g., when printing).

## Symbols

### `body.printing .no-print`
#### Description
This rule hides elements with the class `no-print` when the body has the class `printing`, which is presumably added when the document is being prepared for printing.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| display | CSS property | Sets the display to `none` to hide the element. |

### `body.printing #App`
#### Description
Adjusts the height of the `#App` element to fit its content when printing, ensuring that the entire content is visible on the printed page.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| height | CSS property | Sets the height to `fit-content`. |

### `.printing-output`
#### Description
Removes any maximum height restrictions on elements with the class `printing-output` to ensure that all content is fully visible when printed.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| max-height | CSS property | Sets the max-height to `none`. |

### `@media print`
#### Description
Contains a set of CSS rules that are applied only when the document is being printed. This includes adjustments to color printing, layout, and visibility of elements.

#### Internal Logic
- Adjusts color settings for print accuracy.
- Ensures full-page content visibility by setting `height` and `overflow` properties.
- Prevents page breaks within certain elements to maintain layout integrity.
- Modifies link appearance to include URLs in the printed document.
- Removes visual effects like shadows for a cleaner print output.

## Dependencies

The `print.css` file is imported into the main application stylesheet `App.css`, as seen in the related code snippet. This integration ensures that the print-specific styles are applied when needed.

## Error Handling

There is no explicit error handling in CSS, but the stylesheet uses `!important` to enforce certain styles, ensuring they take precedence over other conflicting styles.

## Logging

There is no logging mechanism in CSS.

## API/Interface Reference

The CSS file does not define an API or public interface, as it is purely for styling purposes.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
