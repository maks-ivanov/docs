## High-level description

The `katex-fonts.css` file is a CSS stylesheet that defines a series of `@font-face` rules to load various KaTeX fonts for use in a web application. These fonts are used to render mathematical expressions and symbols in a visually consistent manner across different browsers. The file specifies different font families, styles, weights, and formats to ensure compatibility and performance.

## Code Structure

The file consists of multiple `@font-face` declarations, each defining a specific font family and its associated properties such as style, weight, and source URLs for different font formats (e.g., `woff2`, `woff`, `truetype`). These declarations are organized by font family and weight, ensuring that the correct font is used for different types of mathematical expressions.

## Symbols

### `@font-face`
#### Description
The `@font-face` rule is used to define a custom font that can be loaded and used in the web application. Each `@font-face` block specifies a font family, style, weight, and the source URLs for the font files in various formats.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| font-family | string | The name of the font family to be used in CSS. |
| font-style | string | The style of the font (e.g., normal, italic). |
| font-weight | number | The weight of the font (e.g., 400 for normal, 700 for bold). |
| font-display | string | The display strategy for the font (e.g., block). |
| src | string | The URLs of the font files in different formats. |

#### Outputs
There are no direct outputs from the `@font-face` rule, but it enables the use of the specified fonts in the web application.

#### Internal Logic
Each `@font-face` block specifies:
- `font-family`: The name under which the font will be referenced in CSS.
- `font-style`: The style of the font, such as normal or italic.
- `font-weight`: The weight of the font, indicating its thickness.
- `font-display`: How the font is displayed while loading (e.g., `block` ensures text is invisible until the font is loaded).
- `src`: A list of URLs pointing to the font files in different formats, ensuring compatibility across various browsers.

## Dependencies

The file relies on the presence of font files located in the `../fonts/KaTeX/` directory. These files must be accessible for the fonts to be loaded correctly.

## Performance Considerations

The use of multiple font formats (`woff2`, `woff`, `truetype`) ensures compatibility across different browsers and devices. The `font-display: block` property is used to prevent the display of fallback fonts while the custom fonts are loading, which can improve the visual consistency of the rendered content.

## Error Handling

There is no explicit error handling in the CSS file. However, if the font files are not found or cannot be loaded, the browser will fall back to default system fonts, which may affect the appearance of mathematical expressions.

## Logging

There is no logging mechanism implemented in this CSS file.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
