## High-level description

The `codehilite.css` file is a CSS stylesheet designed to style code blocks with syntax highlighting. It uses a color scheme inspired by the Xcode Pygments style, modified to resemble GitHub's prettylights theme. The stylesheet defines a variety of CSS variables for different syntax elements and provides styles for both light and dark themes.

## Code Structure

The stylesheet is structured using CSS variables to define colors for different syntax elements, such as keywords, comments, and literals. These variables are then applied to specific CSS classes that correspond to different parts of the code syntax. The file also includes styles for line numbers and special formatting for Python traceback.

## Symbols

### CSS Variables
#### Description
CSS variables are used to define colors for various syntax elements. These variables allow for easy theme customization and are applied to specific syntax classes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| --linenos-special | color | Color for special line numbers |
| --codehilite-hll | color | Highlight color for the current line |
| --codehilite-c | color | Color for comments |
| ... | ... | ... |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | N/A |

#### Internal Logic
The variables are defined within the `:root` selector for the default theme and within the `.dark` class for the dark theme. This allows for easy switching between themes by changing the class on the root element.

### `.codehilite` Classes
#### Description
These classes apply the defined CSS variables to specific parts of the code syntax, such as comments, keywords, and literals.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| .codehilite .c | class | Applies comment color |
| .codehilite .k | class | Applies keyword color |
| ... | ... | ... |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | N/A |

#### Internal Logic
Each class corresponds to a specific syntax element and uses the CSS variable defined for that element to set the color. For example, `.codehilite .c` uses `--codehilite-c` to set the color for comments.

### `.stderr .codehilite` Classes
#### Description
These classes provide special formatting for Python traceback, ensuring that error messages are highlighted appropriately.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| .stderr .codehilite .highlight | class | Applies error color to highlighted text |
| ... | ... | ... |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | N/A |

#### Internal Logic
The classes within `.stderr .codehilite` use specific colors to match error coloring in other parts of the application, ensuring consistency in error presentation.
