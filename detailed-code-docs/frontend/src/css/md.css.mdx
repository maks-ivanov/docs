## High-level description

The `md.css` file is a CSS stylesheet specifically designed to style markdown content within a web application. It provides styling rules for various markdown elements such as paragraphs, headings, links, and icons, ensuring consistent presentation and alignment, especially when markdown is used inside interactive elements like buttons or labels.

## Code Structure

The stylesheet defines styles for markdown elements using CSS selectors. It includes rules for paragraphs, headings, links, and specific cases where markdown is used within buttons or labels. The styles are organized to handle different display contexts, such as full-width displays and nested elements.

## Symbols

### `.markdown p:first-child, .markdown .paragraph:first-child`
#### Description
This rule removes the top margin for the first paragraph or `.paragraph` element within markdown content. This is particularly useful when markdown is used inside buttons or labels to ensure proper alignment and spacing.

### `.markdown p:last-child, .markdown .paragraph:last-child`
#### Description
This rule removes the bottom margin for the last paragraph or `.paragraph` element within markdown content, similar to the first-child rule, to maintain consistent spacing.

### `.markdown h1`
#### Description
Centers the text of the first-level heading (`&lt;h1&gt;`) within markdown content.

### `.config-width-full .markdown h1`
#### Description
Overrides the default centering of `&lt;h1&gt;` to left-align the text when the markdown is displayed in a full-width configuration.

### `.markdown .paragraph`
#### Description
Styles the `.paragraph` class to behave like a block element with specific margins, supporting nested markdown content by converting `&lt;p&gt;` elements to `span.paragraph`.

### `.markdown h1, .markdown h2, .markdown h3, .markdown h4, .markdown h5, .markdown h6`
#### Description
Applies consistent font weight and family to all heading levels within markdown content, using inherited font weight and a custom font variable for the font family.

### `.markdown a`
#### Description
Styles links within markdown content to have a pointer cursor and inherit text decoration, with additional styles applied for hover, active, and visited states.

### `.mo-label .markdown p, .mo-label-block .markdown p, .mo-label .markdown .paragraph, .mo-label-block .markdown .paragraph`
#### Description
Removes padding and margin for paragraphs within markdown content when used inside labels, ensuring proper alignment and spacing.

### `a .markdown .paragraph:has(iconify-icon)`
#### Description
Adds a gap between text and icons when an `iconify-icon` is present next to text within a link.

### `a .markdown iconify-icon:first-child`
#### Description
Adds a margin to the right of the first `iconify-icon` within a link to separate it from subsequent text.

### `button .markdown .paragraph`
#### Description
Aligns icons and text better within buttons by using `inline-flex` display and aligning items to the baseline, with a gap between them.

## Dependencies

The `md.css` file is imported by other CSS files such as `islands.css` and `index.css`, indicating its role in providing markdown styling across different parts of the application.

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `iconify-icon` | Used for styling icons within markdown content. |

## Side Effects

- The styles in `md.css` can affect the layout and appearance of markdown content across the application, especially when markdown is used within interactive elements like buttons and labels.

## Performance Considerations

- The use of CSS variables and inheritance helps maintain consistency and potentially reduces the need for repetitive styling, which can improve maintainability and performance.

## Error Handling

- There is no explicit error handling in CSS, but the use of specific selectors and rules ensures that styles are applied correctly to the intended elements.

## Logging

- There is no logging mechanism in CSS.

## TODOs

- There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
