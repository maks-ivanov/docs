## High-level description

The `globals.css` file is a global stylesheet for a frontend application, which imports various color themes from the Radix UI library and applies Tailwind CSS utilities. It defines a set of CSS custom properties (variables) for both light and dark themes, including colors, fonts, and shadows, to ensure consistent styling across the application. The file also includes some base styles for HTML elements and utility classes using Tailwind's `@apply` directive.

## Code Structure

The code is structured into several main parts:
1. **Imports**: It imports color themes from the Radix UI library and Tailwind CSS layers.
2. **CSS Custom Properties**: It defines a set of CSS variables for both light and dark themes, which are used to maintain consistent styling.
3. **Base Styles**: It applies base styles to all elements and specific styles to the `body` and `a` elements using Tailwind CSS utilities.
