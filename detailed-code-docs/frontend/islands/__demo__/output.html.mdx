title: "output.html"
---

## High-level description

The `output.html` file is a demonstration of a web application built using the Marimo framework. It showcases various interactive components and features such as Markdown rendering, LaTeX embedding, sliders, and code editors. The file is structured to include multiple "islands" of functionality, each encapsulating a specific interactive element or feature.

## Code Structure

The HTML file is structured using Marimo's custom elements, such as `&lt;marimo-island&gt;`, `&lt;marimo-cell-output&gt;`, and `&lt;marimo-cell-code&gt;`. Each "island" represents a self-contained component that can be reactive or static, depending on its configuration. The file also includes external resources like JavaScript and CSS from the Marimo library and other third-party libraries for styling and functionality.

## Symbols

### `&lt;marimo-island&gt;`
#### Description
The `&lt;marimo-island&gt;` element is a custom HTML tag used to encapsulate a specific interactive component or feature within the Marimo framework. Each island can contain output and code elements, and it can be configured to be reactive.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data-app-id | string | Identifier for the application instance. |
| data-cell-id | string | Unique identifier for the cell within the application. |
| data-reactive | boolean | Indicates whether the island is reactive. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| marimo-cell-output | HTML Element | Contains the rendered output of the island. |
| marimo-cell-code | HTML Element | Contains the code associated with the island, often hidden. |

#### Internal Logic
Each `&lt;marimo-island&gt;` can contain multiple child elements that define its behavior and appearance. The `data-reactive` attribute determines if the island updates dynamically based on user interaction or other events.

### `&lt;marimo-cell-output&gt;`
#### Description
This element is used to display the output of a Marimo cell. It can contain various types of content, such as text, images, or interactive UI elements.

### `&lt;marimo-cell-code&gt;`
#### Description
This element holds the code that generates the output for a Marimo cell. It is typically hidden from view but can be used for debugging or educational purposes.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@marimo-team/islands` | Provides the core JavaScript and CSS for Marimo's interactive components. |
| `katex` | Used for rendering LaTeX expressions within the HTML. |
| `Google Fonts` | Provides custom fonts for styling text within the application. |

## Error Handling

The HTML file does not explicitly handle errors, as it primarily serves as a static demonstration of Marimo's capabilities. Error handling would typically be managed by the JavaScript logic within the Marimo framework or the server-side application logic.

## Logging

There is no explicit logging mechanism implemented within this HTML file. Logging would generally be handled by the JavaScript framework or server-side components.

## API/Interface Reference

The file does not define an API or public interface directly. Instead, it relies on the Marimo framework to manage interactions and data flow between the client and server.

## TODOs

There are no explicit TODOs or notes within the code, but the commented-out script and link tags suggest that there might be plans to support local server configurations for development purposes.
