## High-level description

The `index.html` file in the `frontend/islands/__demo__` directory serves as a demonstration page for a web application using the Marimo framework. It showcases various interactive components, such as sliders and Markdown rendering, within custom HTML elements called `marimo-island`. The page is designed to illustrate how Marimo can be used to create dynamic and interactive web applications with embedded code and outputs.

## Code Structure

The HTML file is structured with several custom elements, primarily `marimo-island`, each containing `marimo-cell-output` and `marimo-cell-code` elements. These elements are used to display outputs and contain hidden code snippets, respectively. The page includes a script that loads a TypeScript module, which likely handles the logic for rendering and interacting with these custom elements.

## Symbols

### `marimo-island`
#### Description
`marimo-island` is a custom HTML element used to encapsulate a specific interactive component or section of the Marimo application. Each island is identified by `data-app-id` and `data-cell-id` attributes, which likely correspond to specific application logic or data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data-app-id | string | Identifier for the application instance. |
| data-cell-id | string | Identifier for the specific cell or component within the application. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| marimo-cell-output | HTMLElement | Contains the rendered output of the component. |

### `marimo-cell-output`
#### Description
This element is used to display the output of the code contained within its sibling `marimo-cell-code` element. It can render various types of content, such as text, UI elements, or Markdown.

### `marimo-cell-code`
#### Description
A hidden element that contains the code to be executed for generating the output in the `marimo-cell-output`. The code is URL-encoded and likely processed by the Marimo framework to produce the desired output.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `https://fonts.googleapis.com` | Used to load custom fonts for styling the page. |
| `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.10/dist/katex.min.css` | Provides styling for rendering LaTeX expressions. |

## Configuration

The HTML file includes several configuration options through its meta tags and linked resources:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| charset | string | utf-8 | Character encoding for the document. |
| viewport | string | width=device-width, initial-scale=1 | Configures the viewport for responsive design. |
| theme-color | string | #000000 | Sets the theme color for the browser's UI. |

## Error Handling

The HTML file itself does not contain explicit error handling mechanisms. However, error handling might be implemented within the JavaScript or TypeScript modules that are loaded and executed.

## Logging

There is no explicit logging mechanism implemented within the HTML file. Any logging would likely be handled by the JavaScript or TypeScript code referenced in the script tag.

## API/Interface Reference

The HTML file does not define an API or public interface directly. However, it uses custom elements (`marimo-island`, `marimo-cell-output`, `marimo-cell-code`) that likely interact with the Marimo framework's API to render and manage content dynamically.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
