## High-level description

The `frontend/islands/__demo__` directory contains demonstration HTML files for a web application built using the Marimo framework. These files showcase the framework's capabilities in creating dynamic and interactive web applications through custom HTML elements. The main components within this directory are the `index.html` and `output.html` files, both of which utilize Marimo's custom elements to encapsulate interactive components like sliders, Markdown rendering, and LaTeX embedding.

## What does it do?

The HTML files in this directory serve as demonstration pages for the Marimo framework, illustrating how to build interactive web applications. They use custom HTML elements, such as `marimo-island`, to encapsulate different interactive components. Each "island" can contain code and output elements, allowing for dynamic content rendering. For example, a `marimo-island` might include a slider that, when adjusted, updates a displayed value in real-time. The framework handles the logic for rendering and interacting with these elements, enabling developers to create rich, interactive user interfaces without extensive JavaScript coding.

## Entry points

The main files in this directory are `index.html` and `output.html`. Both files are structured similarly, using Marimo's custom elements to demonstrate various interactive features. The `index.html` file serves as a general demonstration page, while `output.html` focuses more on showcasing specific interactive components and features. The code is organized around the concept of "islands," each representing a self-contained interactive component. Data flow and control flow are managed by the Marimo framework, which processes the code within each island to produce the desired output.

## Key Files

- **`index.html`**: Demonstrates the use of Marimo's custom elements to create interactive web components. It includes various interactive elements like sliders and Markdown rendering within `marimo-island` elements.
  
- **`output.html`**: Similar to `index.html`, this file showcases Marimo's capabilities with a focus on specific interactive features. It includes elements for Markdown rendering, LaTeX embedding, and code editors.

## Dependencies

The HTML files in this directory rely on several external libraries and frameworks:

- **`@marimo-team/islands`**: Provides the core JavaScript and CSS for Marimo's interactive components.
- **`katex`**: Used for rendering LaTeX expressions within the HTML.
- **`Google Fonts`**: Provides custom fonts for styling text within the application.

These dependencies are chosen to enhance the visual and functional aspects of the demonstration pages, allowing for rich text rendering and interactive features.

## Configuration

The HTML files include configuration options through meta tags and linked resources:

- **`charset`**: Specifies the character encoding for the document, set to `utf-8`.
- **`viewport`**: Configures the viewport for responsive design, set to `width=device-width, initial-scale=1`.
- **`theme-color`**: Sets the theme color for the browser's UI, set to `#000000`.

These configurations ensure that the demonstration pages are displayed correctly across different devices and browsers.
