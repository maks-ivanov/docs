## High-level description

The `frontend/islands` directory is part of a web application that demonstrates the use of the Marimo framework to create dynamic and interactive web components. This directory contains HTML files and a Python script that showcase how to build web applications using Marimo's custom HTML elements, referred to as "islands." These islands encapsulate interactive components such as sliders, Markdown rendering, and LaTeX embedding. The directory includes demonstration files, a script for generating HTML content, and documentation for development.

## What does it do?

The `frontend/islands` directory provides a demonstration of how to use the Marimo framework to create interactive web applications. The HTML files (`index.html` and `output.html`) serve as examples of how to use Marimo's custom elements to build interactive components. These components, or "islands," can include features like real-time updating sliders, Markdown rendering, and LaTeX embedding. The Marimo framework handles the logic for rendering and interacting with these elements, allowing developers to create rich user interfaces with minimal JavaScript coding.

The `generate.py` script is used to programmatically generate HTML content that includes these interactive islands. It uses the `experimental_MarimoIslandGenerator` to transform code snippets into interactive HTML components. This script demonstrates the capabilities of Marimo in rendering various UI elements within these islands.

## Entry points

The main files in this directory are `index.html`, `output.html`, and `generate.py`. 

- `index.html` and `output.html` are structured to demonstrate the interactive features of Marimo's custom elements. They serve as demonstration pages showcasing different interactive components.
- `generate.py` is a Python script that generates HTML content using Marimo's framework. It constructs code snippets and transforms them into interactive HTML components, which are then embedded into a webpage.

## Key Files

- **`index.html`**: Demonstrates the use of Marimo's custom elements to create interactive web components. It includes various interactive elements like sliders and Markdown rendering within `marimo-island` elements.
  
- **`output.html`**: Similar to `index.html`, this file showcases Marimo's capabilities with a focus on specific interactive features. It includes elements for Markdown rendering, LaTeX embedding, and code editors.

- **`generate.py`**: A script that generates HTML content using the Marimo framework. It uses the `experimental_MarimoIslandGenerator` to create interactive HTML components from code snippets.

## Dependencies

The directory relies on several external libraries and frameworks:

- **`@marimo-team/islands`**: Provides the core JavaScript and CSS for Marimo's interactive components.
- **`katex`**: Used for rendering LaTeX expressions within the HTML.
- **`Google Fonts`**: Provides custom fonts for styling text within the application.
- **`asyncio`**: Used in the `generate.py` script for asynchronous operations.
- **`textwrap.dedent`**: Utilized in the `generate.py` script to format multi-line strings.

These dependencies are chosen to enhance the visual and functional aspects of the demonstration pages, allowing for rich text rendering and interactive features.

## Configuration

The HTML files include configuration options through meta tags and linked resources:

- **`charset`**: Specifies the character encoding for the document, set to `utf-8`.
- **`viewport`**: Configures the viewport for responsive design, set to `width=device-width, initial-scale=1`.
- **`theme-color`**: Sets the theme color for the browser's UI, set to `#000000`.

These configurations ensure that the demonstration pages are displayed correctly across different devices and browsers.
