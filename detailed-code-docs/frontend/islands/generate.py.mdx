## High-level description

The `frontend/islands/generate.py` script is designed to generate HTML content using the Marimo framework, specifically leveraging the `experimental_MarimoIslandGenerator`. It constructs a series of code snippets, which are then transformed into interactive HTML components (referred to as "islands") that can be embedded into a webpage. The script demonstrates the use of Marimo's capabilities to render Markdown, LaTeX, and other UI elements within these islands.

## Code Structure

The main components of the script are:
- The `experimental_MarimoIslandGenerator` instance, which is responsible for managing and rendering the code snippets into HTML.
- A list of code snippets (`stubs`) that are added to the generator, each representing a different interactive or display element.
- The `run` function, which orchestrates the generation of the HTML content by adding code snippets to the generator, building the app, and printing the final HTML output.

## Symbols

### `run`
#### Description
The `run` function is the main entry point of the script. It initializes the Marimo island generator, adds several code snippets to it, builds the app, and generates the final HTML output.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None (The function prints the HTML output directly to the console.)

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the `experimental_MarimoIslandGenerator`.
2. Adds a series of code snippets to the generator using `generator.add_code()`. These snippets include:
   - Importing the Marimo library.
   - Displaying Markdown content.
   - Creating a UI slider.
   - Rendering a matplotlib plot.
   - Displaying LaTeX content.
3. Builds the app using `asyncio.run(generator.build())`.
4. Constructs the HTML document, embedding the rendered code snippets and additional HTML content.
5. Prints the final HTML output.

## References

- `experimental_MarimoIslandGenerator`: This is a class from the Marimo library used to generate and manage interactive code snippets as HTML islands.
- `generator.add_code()`: A method used to add code snippets to the generator, specifying whether to display the code and/or its output.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `asyncio` | Used to run asynchronous operations, specifically for building the app. |
| `textwrap.dedent` | Utilized to cleanly format multi-line strings. |
| `marimo.experimental_MarimoIslandGenerator` | The core class used for generating Marimo islands. |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that all operations, such as adding code snippets and building the app, will succeed without exceptions.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in this script. The output is directly printed to the console.

## TODOs

No TODOs are present in the code.
