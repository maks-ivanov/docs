## Symbols
### `env`
#### Description
Specifies the environments the code is designed to run in, enabling ESLint to apply environment-specific rules. Here, it's set to `"browser": true`, indicating the code will run in a browser environment.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a configuration object, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a configuration object, not a function.

### `extends`
#### Description
Extends this configuration by inheriting rules from other ESLint configurations. It includes recommended rulesets from ESLint, TypeScript-specific rules, SolidJS rules, and Prettier rules for code formatting.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a configuration object, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a configuration object, not a function.

### `parser`
#### Description
Defines the parser used by ESLint to understand the code. It's set to `"@typescript-eslint/parser"`, which allows ESLint to parse TypeScript code.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a configuration object, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a configuration object, not a function.

### `parserOptions`
#### Description
Provides additional configuration options to the parser. Here, it specifies the `project` as `"./tsconfig.json"`, allowing the TypeScript parser to understand the project's TypeScript configuration.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a configuration object, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a configuration object, not a function.

### `plugins`
#### Description
Includes additional ESLint plugins to extend its functionality. It includes `"@typescript-eslint"` for TypeScript-specific linting and `"solid"` for SolidJS-specific linting.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a configuration object, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a configuration object, not a function.

### `rules`
#### Description
Defines project-specific ESLint rules, overriding or extending the inherited rules. It configures the `prettier/prettier` rule for code formatting and the `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` rule to prevent unused variables.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a configuration object, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a configuration object, not a function.

### `overrides`
#### Description
Allows defining specific ESLint configurations for certain files or file patterns within the project. Currently, it's an empty array, meaning no overrides are defined.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a configuration object, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a configuration object, not a function.

### `ignorePatterns`
#### Description
Specifies files and folders that ESLint should ignore during linting. It excludes `node_modules`, `dist`, and various configuration files from linting.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a configuration object, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a configuration object, not a function.
