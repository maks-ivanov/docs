## High-level description
This CSS file defines the basic styling for a web application's dashboard, leveraging Tailwind CSS for utility classes and adding custom styles for code snippets.

## Table of contents
- Tailwind Directives
- Code Block Styles
- Shiki Code Block Styles

## Symbols
There are no named symbols (functions, classes, etc.) in this CSS file. It primarily defines styles that are applied globally or to specific HTML elements.

### `@tailwind base;`
#### Description
This directive imports the base styles from Tailwind CSS, providing a foundation for the application's styling.

### `@tailwind components;`
#### Description
This directive imports Tailwind CSS's component styles, which offer pre-defined styles for common UI elements.

### `@tailwind utilities;`
#### Description
This directive imports Tailwind CSS's utility classes, enabling the use of single-purpose classes for styling elements directly in the HTML markup.

### `pre`
#### Description
This selector targets all `&lt;pre&gt;` HTML elements, typically used for displaying preformatted text, such as code snippets.
It applies styles to ensure code blocks have horizontal scrolling for long lines and padding around them.

#### Internal Logic
- `overflow-x: auto;`: Enables horizontal scrolling if the content within the `&lt;pre&gt;` tag exceeds the container's width.
- `padding: 1rem 0;`: Adds 1rem (usually 16px) of padding to the top and bottom of the `&lt;pre&gt;` element.

### `pre.shiki`
#### Description
This selector targets `&lt;pre&gt;` elements with the class "shiki," likely indicating code blocks styled with the Shiki library.
It applies additional styles to these code blocks, including rounded corners and padding.

#### Internal Logic
- `border-radius: 8px;`: Rounds the corners of the code block for a softer appearance.
- `padding-right: 14px;`: Adds 14px of padding to the right side of the code block.
- `padding-left: 14px;`: Adds 14px of padding to the left side of the code block.

## Dependencies
- **Tailwind CSS:** Used as the primary styling framework, providing utility classes and a styling base.

## Future Improvements
- **Theme Customization:** Consider defining custom color palettes, fonts, and other theme variables to tailor the dashboard's appearance further.
- **Component-Specific Styles:** As the dashboard grows, create separate CSS files or use CSS modules to organize styles for individual components or sections.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure the dashboard's layout and styling adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
