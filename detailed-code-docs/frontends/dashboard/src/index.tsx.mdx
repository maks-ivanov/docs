## High-level description
This code defines the main client-side routing for the Trieve dashboard application using the SolidJS Router. It maps various URL paths to their corresponding page components, defining the application's navigation structure. The code also initializes Sentry for error tracking in production and renders the application into the 'root' element of the HTML document.

## Table of contents
- Sentry Initialization
- Routing

## References
- `ContextWrapper` - Provides global context for user and dataset information.
- `DashboardLayout` - Layout component for the main dashboard section.
- `DatasetLayout` - Layout component for dataset-specific pages.
- Page components: `Home`, `Overview`, `DatasetStart`, `DatasetSettingsPage`, `Settings`, `Billing`, `UserManagement`, `DatasetEvents`, `ApiKeys`.

## Symbols
### `index.tsx`
#### Description
This code initializes Sentry for error tracking in production environments and sets up the client-side routing for the Trieve dashboard application using SolidJS Router. It defines routes for various pages within the application, including the home page, dashboard, dataset pages, and settings.

#### Inputs
This code does not take any specific inputs.

#### Outputs
This code does not have any direct outputs. It renders the application content to the DOM.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Sentry Initialization:**
   - Checks if the environment is not development (`!DEV`).
   - If true, initializes Sentry with the provided DSN and configurations for error tracking.
2. **Routing:**
   - Uses `Router` and `Route` components from `solid-js/router` to define the application's navigation structure.
   - Wraps all routes within a `ContextWrapper` component to provide global context.
   - Defines routes for:
     - Home page (`/`).
     - Dataset-specific pages (`/dashboard/dataset/:dataset_id/*`).
     - Main dashboard pages (`/dashboard/:id/*`).
     - 404 pages for unmatched routes.
   - Renders the matched component into the 'root' element of the HTML document.

## Side Effects
- Initializes Sentry, which starts tracking errors and sending them to the configured Sentry server.
- Modifies the DOM by rendering the application content into the 'root' element.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js/web | Provides core SolidJS functionality for rendering and component management. |
| @sentry/browser | Used for error tracking and reporting. |
| @solidjs/router | Enables client-side routing for the application. |

### Configuration
- `import.meta.env.VITE_SENTRY_DASHBOARD_DSN` - The DSN (Data Source Name) used by Sentry to identify the project for error tracking.
- `import.meta.env.VITE_API_HOST` - The base URL of the API server.

## Error Handling
- The code initializes Sentry for error tracking, which will catch and report errors during runtime.
- Specific error handling for network requests and other operations is handled within individual components.

## Logging
- The code does not implement any specific logging mechanisms. Logging might be handled by Sentry or within individual components.
