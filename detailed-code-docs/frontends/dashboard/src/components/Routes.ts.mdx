## High-level description
This code defines a TypeScript constant `ApiRoutes` which is an object that maps API route scopes to an array of specific API endpoints associated with that scope. This provides a structured way to manage and reference API routes within the application.

## Table of contents
- `ApiRoutes`

## Symbols

### Symbol Name
#### `ApiRoutes`
#### Description
A constant object that maps API route scopes to an array of corresponding API endpoints. This structure helps organize and reference API routes based on their functional areas.

#### Inputs
_This symbol does not take any inputs._

#### Outputs
_This symbol does not return any outputs. It is a constant object._

#### Internal Logic
The `ApiRoutes` object is structured as follows:
- **Keys:** Represent the scope or category of the API routes (e.g., `"api/analytics"`, `"api/auth"`).
- **Values:** Each key is associated with an array of strings. Each string represents a specific API endpoint belonging to that scope, including the HTTP method and path.

For example:
```typescript
"api/chunk": [
  "POST /api/chunk",
  "PUT /api/chunk",
  // ... more endpoints
],
```

This structure allows easy access to all endpoints related to a specific scope. For instance, `ApiRoutes["api/chunk"]` would provide an array of all chunk-related API endpoints.

## References
- This constant is referenced in `ApiKeyGenerateModal.tsx` to provide options for selecting API route scopes when generating API keys. 

## Future Improvements
- Consider using a more robust data structure than an array of strings to represent the API routes. This could include additional information like request/response types, descriptions, or specific parameters for each endpoint. This would enhance readability and type safety.
- As the API grows, consider breaking down `ApiRoutes` into smaller, more manageable modules based on functional areas. This would improve maintainability and organization.
