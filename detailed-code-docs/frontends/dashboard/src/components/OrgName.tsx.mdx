### `OrgName`
#### Description
This functional component retrieves the name of the selected organization from the user context and displays it within an `h3` tag.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element (`h3`) containing the name of the selected organization.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the `UserContext` using `useContext`.
2. Uses `createMemo` to create a memoized value `selectedOrganization` that:
    - Gets the `selectedOrganizationId` from the `userContext`.
    - If no `selectedOrganizationId` is found, returns `null`.
    - Otherwise, finds the organization object from the `userContext.user.orgs` array that matches the `selectedOrganizationId`.
3. Renders an `h3` tag displaying the `name` property of the `selectedOrganization` along with the string " Organization".

## Side Effects
This component has no side effects.

## Dependencies
- `solid-js`: Used for creating components, managing state, and memoization.
- `UserContext`: Provides access to the user's information, including the selected organization.
