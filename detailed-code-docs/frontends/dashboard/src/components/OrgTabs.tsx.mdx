## Symbols

### Symbol Name: `OrgTabs`
#### Description
This functional component renders a set of navigation tabs for different sections of an organization's dashboard. It retrieves the currently selected organization ID from the `UserContext` and constructs links to various dashboard pages, including Overview, Users, Billing, API Keys, and Settings. The `activeClass` prop is used to visually highlight the currently active tab.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the navigation tabs.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the `UserContext` using `useContext`.
2. Uses `createMemo` to create a reactive variable `currentOrgId` that updates whenever the `selectedOrganizationId` in the `UserContext` changes.
3. Renders a `div` container with the navigation tabs.
4. Each tab is an `&lt;A&gt;` (anchor) component from `solid-js/router` that links to a specific dashboard page.
5. The `href` attribute of each tab is dynamically generated using the `currentOrgId`.
6. The `activeClass` prop is used to apply a visual style to the active tab.
