### `NavBar`
#### Description
This functional component renders the navigation bar at the top of the dashboard. It displays the Trieve logo, which links to the dashboard overview page of the currently selected organization. It also includes a "Help or Contact" button that, when clicked, reveals a popover with links to various support resources, including email, Matrix, GitHub, and Discord.

#### Inputs
This component does not take any props.

#### Outputs
Returns the JSX code for rendering the navigation bar.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Retrieves user context:** Uses `useContext(UserContext)` to access the user's context, including the selected organization ID.
2. **Handles logo click:** When the logo is clicked, it navigates to the dashboard overview page of the currently selected organization using `useNavigate` from `@solidjs/router`.
3. **Renders help/contact popover:**
   - Uses the `Popover` component from `terracotta` to create a popover that opens on click.
   - The popover contains links to various support resources, including:
     - Email: `mailto:help@arguflow.ai`
     - Matrix: `https://matrix.to/#/#trieve-general:trieve.ai`
     - GitHub: `https://github.com/devflowinc/trieve/issues`
     - Discord: `https://discord.gg/E9sPRZqpDT`
