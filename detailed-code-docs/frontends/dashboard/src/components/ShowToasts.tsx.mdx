## High-level description
The `ShowToasts` component is responsible for displaying toast notifications on the dashboard. It listens for custom "show-toast" events dispatched by other components and renders toasts based on the event details. Each toast has a type, title, optional message, and timeout.

### `createToast`
#### Description
Dispatches a custom "show-toast" event to trigger the display of a toast notification.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `{ type, message, title, timeout }` | `ToastDetail` | An object containing the details of the toast to be displayed. |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a new `CustomEvent` with the name "show-toast" and the provided toast details.
- Dispatches the event on the window object.

### `ShowToasts`
#### Description
A SolidJS component that listens for "show-toast" events and renders toast notifications accordingly.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
- JSX Element: A `div` containing the rendered toasts.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses a `createSignal` to store an array of `ToastDetail` objects representing the currently active toasts.
- Uses a `createEffect` to:
    - Listen for "show-toast" events on the window object.
    - When a "show-toast" event is received:
        - Extracts the toast details from the event.
        - Adds the new toast details to the `toastDetails` signal, preventing duplicates based on the message.
        - Sets a timeout to remove the toast after the specified timeout (defaulting to 1500ms).
    - Cleans up the event listener and timeout on component unmount.
- Uses a `For` loop to iterate over the `toastDetails` signal and render each toast as a `div` with appropriate styling and icons based on the toast type.
- Provides a close button (using the `VsClose` icon) to manually dismiss each toast.

## Side Effects
