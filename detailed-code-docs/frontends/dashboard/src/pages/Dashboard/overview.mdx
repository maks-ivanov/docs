## High-level description
This directory, `frontends/dashboard/src/pages/Dashboard`, houses the core components of the Trieve dashboard application. It provides users with a centralized interface for managing their organizations, datasets, billing information, and user accounts.

## What does it do?
This directory contains the components that render the main sections of the Trieve dashboard, allowing users to:

- **Overview:** View organization details, usage statistics, and a list of datasets. Users can also create new datasets from this section.
- **Dataset:** Manage individual datasets, including settings configuration, event logging, and usage overview.
- **Billing:** Access and manage billing information, view available plans, and upgrade, downgrade, or cancel subscriptions.
- **Settings:** Modify organization settings, such as the organization name, and perform sensitive actions like deleting the organization.
- **User Management:** Handle user management tasks, including viewing user details, inviting new users, editing user roles, and removing users.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this directory are the individual component files, each representing a specific section of the dashboard:

- `Billing.tsx`: Manages billing-related information and actions.
- `Dataset/`: Contains components related to dataset management.
- `Overview.tsx`: Provides an overview of the user's organization and datasets.
- `Settings.tsx`: Handles organization settings and actions.
- `UserManagement.tsx`: Manages users and invitations within an organization.

These components are typically rendered within a layout structure provided by the parent application, offering navigation and context to the user.

## Key Files
### frontends/dashboard/src/pages/Dashboard/Dataset
This subdirectory contains components related to managing individual datasets. For more details, refer to the detailed summary of `frontends/dashboard/src/pages/Dashboard/Dataset`.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

- **SolidJS:** The core framework for building the user interface.
- **@solidjs/router:** Enables routing and navigation between different sections of the dashboard.
- **shared/types:** Provides shared type definitions used across the application.
- **Internal components and contexts:** Includes components for modals, toasts, forms, and contexts like `UserContext` and `DatasetContext` for managing application state.

## Configuration
The components in this directory primarily rely on the following for configuration:

- **Environment variables:** Used to retrieve API endpoints and other environment-specific settings.
- **Context:** The `UserContext` and `DatasetContext` provide access to user and dataset-related data, influencing the behavior and rendering of components.
- **Server-side configuration:** Some components, like those in the `Dataset` subdirectory, interact with server-side configurations to manage dataset settings.
