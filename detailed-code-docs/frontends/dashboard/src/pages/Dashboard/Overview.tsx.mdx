### Overview
#### Description
A functional component that displays an overview of the user's selected organization. It fetches organization and usage data, and renders components for displaying this information, as well as a list of datasets.

#### Inputs
This is a React component, so it uses props instead of formal input parameters. This component has no defined props.

#### Outputs
This component returns JSX to render the organization overview.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Retrieves API host and user context:** Fetches the API host from environment variables and accesses the user context.
2. **Defines signals for component state:** Creates signals to store organization subscription plan, organization usage, and the open state of the new dataset modal.
3. **Memoizes the selected organization:** Uses a memo to efficiently derive the selected organization from the user context.
4. **Fetches data on organization selection change:** When the selected organization ID changes, fetches the organization subscription plan and usage data from the API.
5. **Renders the overview:**
   - Displays a section with a call to action to create a dataset and links to API documentation.
   - Renders the `BuildingSomething` component.
   - Shows the selected organization's name and ID, with a copy button for the ID.
   - Renders the `OrganizationUsageOverview` component to display usage information.
   - Conditionally renders the `DatasetOverview` component if an organization is selected.
   - Renders the `NewDatasetModal` component, which is controlled by a signal.

## Side Effects
- Fetches data from the API when the selected organization ID changes.
- Updates the clipboard when the copy button is clicked.
- Displays toasts on API errors and successful copy actions.

## Dependencies
This section is not included because the dependencies are listed at the top of the file.

## Error Handling
- Displays a toast message if there is an error fetching organization usage data.
- Includes specific error handling for a 403 status code, suggesting a role change requiring re-authentication.

## Logging
- Logs errors encountered during API requests to the console.
