### Symbol Name
`Home`

#### Description
This functional component handles redirecting the user to the appropriate dashboard based on their selected organization. If no organization is selected, it defaults to the first organization the user is a member of.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This component renders a `&lt;div /&gt;` element, which is essentially a placeholder during the redirect.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Retrieves User Context:** It uses `useContext(UserContext)` to access the user's context, including their selected organization ID.
2. **Redirects on Load:** The `createEffect` hook triggers a redirect to the dashboard URL constructed using the `selectedOrganizationId`. If no organization is selected, it defaults to the first organization the user belongs to.

## Side Effects
- **Redirection:** This component causes a browser redirect to the user's selected organization's dashboard.
