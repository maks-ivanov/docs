## High-level description
This directory contains two important context providers for a dashboard application built with SolidJS: `DatasetContext` and `UserContext`. These contexts manage and provide access to dataset information and user-related data respectively, enabling state management and data flow across the application.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory sets up two crucial pieces of the application's state management:

1. Dataset Management: It fetches and provides access to dataset information based on the current route's dataset ID. This allows components throughout the application to easily access and use dataset details without having to pass props through multiple levels.

2. User Management: It handles user authentication, login/logout functionality, and organization selection. It also provides access to user information and loading states across the application.

These contexts work together to create a seamless experience for users interacting with datasets within their organizations.

## Entry points
The main files in this directory are:

1. `DatasetContext.tsx`: This file defines the `DatasetContext` and `DatasetContextWrapper` component. It's responsible for fetching and providing dataset information.

2. `UserContext.tsx`: This file defines the `UserContext` and `UserContextWrapper` component. It manages user authentication, organization selection, and provides user-related data and actions.

The data flow in the application typically starts with the `UserContext`, which handles authentication and organization selection. Once a user is authenticated and an organization is selected, the `DatasetContext` can then fetch and provide dataset information based on the current route and user permissions.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the following external libraries and frameworks:

1. SolidJS: A declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's used for creating reactive components and managing state.

2. @solidjs/router: Used for routing functionality, specifically the `useParams` hook to access route parameters.

3. shared/types: A custom package that provides shared type definitions, including `Dataset` and `SlimUser` types.

These dependencies were likely chosen for their performance benefits (SolidJS), seamless integration with the SolidJS ecosystem (@solidjs/router), and to maintain consistency in type definitions across different parts of the application (shared/types).

## Configuration
The code uses environment variables for configuration:

- `VITE_API_HOST`: Specifies the base URL of the API server. This is used in both contexts to make API requests.

This environment variable allows for easy configuration of the API endpoint across different environments (development, staging, production) without changing the code.

Both context providers use this configuration to construct the full API URLs for fetching user data and dataset information. The use of environment variables allows for flexible deployment across different environments without code changes.
