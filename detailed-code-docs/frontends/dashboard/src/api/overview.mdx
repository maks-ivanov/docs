Based on the summaries provided, I can compare and contrast the two files:

1. Purpose:
   - createDataset.ts: Focuses on creating a new dataset by sending a POST request to the backend API.
   - uploadSampleData.ts: Handles uploading sample data to an existing dataset by fetching, processing, and sending data to the API.

2. Main Functions:
   - createDataset.ts: Contains a single main function `createNewDataset`.
   - uploadSampleData.ts: Contains multiple functions, with `uploadSampleData` being the main orchestrator.

3. API Interactions:
   - createDataset.ts: Interacts with the `/dataset` endpoint.
   - uploadSampleData.ts: Interacts with the `/chunk` endpoint.

4. Data Handling:
   - createDataset.ts: Sends metadata about the dataset (name, organization ID, server configuration).
   - uploadSampleData.ts: Processes and sends actual data content (CSV data transformed into a specific format).

5. Error Handling:
   - createDataset.ts: Parses error responses and throws new errors with messages.
   - uploadSampleData.ts: Uses promise rejection for error handling.

6. Progress Reporting:
   - createDataset.ts: Does not implement progress reporting.
   - uploadSampleData.ts: Includes an optional progress reporting callback.

7. Data Processing:
   - createDataset.ts: Does not involve data processing.
   - uploadSampleData.ts: Includes CSV parsing, data transformation, and batching.

8. Dependencies:
   - createDataset.ts: Relies on types from a shared types module.
   - uploadSampleData.ts: Uses the papaparse library for CSV parsing.

9. Flexibility:
   - createDataset.ts: More focused and specific to dataset creation.
   - uploadSampleData.ts: More complex, handling various stages of data processing and upload.

Both files are part of the API interaction layer of the dashboard frontend, but they serve different purposes in the dataset management workflow. The createDataset.ts file is likely used when setting up a new dataset, while uploadSampleData.ts would be used to populate that dataset with initial data.
