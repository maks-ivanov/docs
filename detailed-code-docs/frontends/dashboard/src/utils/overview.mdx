## High-level description
This directory contains utility functions for the Trieve.ai dashboard frontend. The utilities focus on two main areas: creating code snippets for API requests and formatting numbers for display purposes. These functions are designed to enhance the user experience and provide developers with example code for integrating with the Trieve.ai API.

## What does it do?
The utility functions in this directory serve two primary purposes:

1. API Request Code Generation:
   - Creates example code snippets that developers can use to interact with the Trieve.ai API.
   - Generates JavaScript code for creating new data chunks and performing hybrid searches within datasets.

2. Number Formatting:
   - Formats numbers by adding commas as thousands separators for better readability.
   - Converts file sizes from megabytes to human-readable formats (MB, GB, or TB) for easier comprehension.

These utilities help simplify the process of integrating with the Trieve.ai platform and improve the presentation of numerical data in the dashboard.

## Key Files

1. `createCodeSnippets.tsx`:
   This file contains two main functions:
   - `createChunkRequest`: Generates a code snippet for creating a new chunk of data in a specified dataset.
   - `hybridSearchRequest`: Generates a code snippet for performing a hybrid search within a dataset.

   Both functions return JavaScript `fetch` calls with the necessary headers and body content for interacting with the Trieve.ai API. These snippets are likely used in the `DatasetStart.tsx` component to provide example API requests to developers.

2. `formatNumbers.ts`:
   This file provides two utility functions for number formatting:
   - `formatNumberWithCommas`: Adds commas as thousands separators to a number.
   - `formatStorage`: Converts a file size in megabytes to a human-readable format (MB, GB, or TB).

   These functions are useful for improving the readability of numerical data displayed in the dashboard.

## Dependencies
The utility functions in this directory do not rely on any external libraries or frameworks. They are implemented using native JavaScript/TypeScript features.

## Configuration
The code snippets generated by the `createCodeSnippets.tsx` file use placeholder values for the dataset ID and authorization token. In a real-world scenario, these values would need to be replaced with actual configuration data:

```javascript
headers: {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'TR-Dataset': '${dataset}',
  'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
},
```

Developers integrating with the Trieve.ai API would need to replace `'${dataset}'` with their actual dataset ID and `'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'` with their valid API key.

The `formatNumbers.ts` file does not require any specific configuration.

These utility functions provide a foundation for interacting with the Trieve.ai API and formatting numerical data in the dashboard. They can be easily imported and used throughout the frontend application to maintain consistency in API interactions and number formatting.
