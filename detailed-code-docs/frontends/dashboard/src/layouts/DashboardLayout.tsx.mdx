## Code Structure
The `DashboardLayout` component uses the `UserContext` to determine the currently selected organization and user roles. It then uses a `Switch` statement to render different content based on the user's access level and organization membership. The `NavBar`, `Sidebar`, `OrgName`, and `OrgTabs` components are used to display the dashboard's header, sidebar, and organization-specific information.
