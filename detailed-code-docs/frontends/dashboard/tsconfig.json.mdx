---

## High-level description
This file, `tsconfig.json`, configures the TypeScript compiler for the `dashboard` frontend project. It extends a base configuration from `config/tsconfig` and disables the `noUnusedLocals` check.

## Table of contents
- `extends`
- `compilerOptions`
- `include`

## References
- `config/tsconfig`: This file extends a base TypeScript configuration, indicating a shared setup across the project.

## Symbols
### `extends`
#### Description
Specifies the path to a base configuration file to inherit settings from. This promotes consistency and avoids redundancy in TypeScript configuration across the project.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a configuration property, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a configuration property, not a function.

### `compilerOptions`
#### Description
Contains compiler options that override or extend the base configuration.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a configuration property, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a configuration property, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
- `noUnusedLocals`: Setting this to `false` disables the check for unused local variables during compilation. This might be relaxed for this specific frontend project due to development practices or tooling used.

### `include`
#### Description
Specifies the files and directories to include in the TypeScript compilation process.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a configuration property, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a configuration property, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
- `"src"`: Includes all files within the `src` directory for compilation. This is a common pattern to structure source code within a project.
