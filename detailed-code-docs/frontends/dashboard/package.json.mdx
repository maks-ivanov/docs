title: "package.json"
---

## High-level description
This file, `package.json`, is a manifest file for the `dashboard` frontend of a software project. It defines metadata, dependencies, scripts, and other configurations for the project, using Node.js and likely a build tool like Vite. This file is crucial for managing the project's dependencies, development workflow, and build process.

## Table of contents
- `name`
- `private`
- `version`
- `type`
- `scripts`
- `dependencies`
- `devDependencies`

## References
This file references a `shared` package, indicating a common codebase used across different parts of the project.

## Symbols
This file does not define any symbols like functions or classes. It is a configuration file in JSON format.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@nozbe/microfuzz` | Likely used for fuzz testing |
| `@sentry/browser` | For error tracking and monitoring in the browser |
| `@solidjs/router` | Routing library for SolidJS applications |
| `papaparse` | CSV parsing library |
| `shared` | Internal package containing shared code |
| `shiki` | Code highlighting library |
| `solid-icons` | Icon set for SolidJS |
| `solid-js` | The core SolidJS library |
| `terracotta` | Possibly a UI component library |
| `vite-plugin-runtime-env` | Vite plugin for managing environment variables at runtime |

### Configuration
This section describes the configuration options defined in the `package.json` file.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| `name` | string | `dashboard` | The name of the project |
| `private` | boolean | `true` | Prevents accidental publishing of the package |
| `version` | string | `0.0.0` | The current version of the project |
| `type` | string | `module` | Specifies that the project uses ECMAScript modules |
| `scripts` | object |  | Defines various scripts for development, building, and linting |
| `dependencies` | object |  | Lists the project's runtime dependencies |
| `devDependencies` | object |  | Lists the project's development dependencies |

The `scripts` section defines several commands that can be run using `npm run &lt;script-name&gt;`. These commands include:

- `dev`: Starts the development server using Vite on port 5173.
- `build`: Builds the production-ready application.
- `preview`: Previews the production build.
- `lint`: Formats the code with Prettier and fixes linting issues with ESLint.
- `lint:only`: Fixes linting issues with ESLint.
- `lint:CI`: Fixes linting issues with ESLint and outputs a report in JSON format.

## Future Improvements
- The `terracotta` library is not widely known, consider adding a brief description to the dependencies table or replacing it with a more common alternative if possible.
- The version of some dependencies might be outdated. Consider using a tool like `npm outdated` to check for newer versions and update them accordingly.
- The `shared` package is not versioned. Consider publishing it to a package registry (like npm or a private one) to manage its version and updates more effectively.
