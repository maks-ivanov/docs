## High-level description
This file is a TypeScript declaration file that references the type definitions for Vite's client. It ensures that TypeScript recognizes Vite-specific types and globals in the project.

## Table of contents
- Type reference directive

## Symbols
### `/// &lt;reference types="vite/client" /&gt;`
#### Description
This is a triple-slash directive that tells TypeScript to include type definitions from the "vite/client" module. It allows the TypeScript compiler to recognize Vite-specific types and globals throughout the project.

#### Inputs
This directive does not have inputs in the traditional sense.

#### Outputs
This directive does not produce outputs directly. Instead, it enhances the TypeScript environment by including Vite's client-side type definitions.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| vite | Provides type definitions for Vite's client-side features |

## Future Improvements
- As Vite evolves, ensure that the referenced types are up-to-date with the latest version of Vite being used in the project.
- If the project starts using additional Vite plugins or features, consider adding more specific type references as needed.
