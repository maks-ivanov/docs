## High-level description

This directory contains utility functions and type definitions for a search frontend application. It includes two main files: `apiTypes.ts` and `downloadFile.ts`. These files provide essential functionality for handling API responses, type checking, and file downloading.

## What does it do?

The utility functions in this directory serve several important purposes:

1. Type Definitions: It defines a comprehensive set of TypeScript interfaces and types that represent various data structures used throughout the application. These include definitions for chunks, groups, users, datasets, and more.

2. Type Guards: It provides type guard functions that allow for runtime type checking of objects, ensuring they conform to specific interfaces. This helps prevent errors when working with data of uncertain structure.

3. API Interaction: It includes utility functions for interacting with the application's API, such as fetching file metadata and initiating downloads.

4. Data Handling: It offers functions for handling specific data types, such as referral tokens and message roles.

5. File Downloads: It provides a function to download files by fetching metadata from the API and using the browser's download mechanism.

## Key Files

1. `apiTypes.ts`:
   - Defines a large number of TypeScript interfaces and types used throughout the application.
   - Includes type guard functions for runtime type checking.
   - Provides utility functions for handling referral tokens and message roles.

2. `downloadFile.ts`:
   - Exports a single function `downloadFile` that handles the process of downloading files.
   - Fetches file metadata from the API and triggers a browser download.

## Dependencies

The code relies on the following external dependencies:

- TypeScript: The entire codebase is written in TypeScript, providing strong typing and improved developer experience.
- Vite: The application uses Vite as its build tool, as evidenced by the use of the `VITE_API_HOST` environment variable.

## Configuration

The `downloadFile.ts` file uses an environment variable:

- `VITE_API_HOST`: This variable should contain the base URL for the API. It's used to construct the full URL for API requests.

## Code Snippets

Here's an example of how the `downloadFile` function works:

```typescript
export async function downloadFile(fileId: string, datasetId: string) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(
      `${VITE_API_HOST}/api/v1/datasets/${datasetId}/files/${fileId}`,
      {
        method: "GET",
        credentials: "include",
      }
    );

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error("Failed to fetch dataset");
    }

    const data = (await response.json()) as ChunkFile;
    const link = document.createElement("a");
    link.href = data.s3_url;
    link.download = data.file_name;
    link.click();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error downloading file:", error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

This function demonstrates how to fetch file metadata from the API, create a temporary link element, and trigger a download using the browser's built-in download mechanism.

The `apiTypes.ts` file contains numerous type definitions. Here's an example of one such definition along with its type guard function:

```typescript
export interface ChunkMetadata {
  id: string;
  chunk_html?: string;
  link?: string;
  qdrant_point_id: string;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
  tag_set?: string[];
  tracking_id?: string;
  time_stamp?: string;
  metadata?: Record&lt;string, never&gt;;
  dataset_id: string;
  weight: number;
  location?: { lat: number; lon: number };
  num_value?: number;
  image_urls?: string[];
}

export function isChunkMetadata(chunk: unknown): chunk is ChunkMetadata {
  return (
    typeof chunk === "object" &&
    chunk !== null &&
    indirectHasOwnProperty(chunk, "id") &&
    typeof chunk.id === "string" &&
    indirectHasOwnProperty(chunk, "qdrant_point_id") &&
    typeof chunk.qdrant_point_id === "string" &&
    indirectHasOwnProperty(chunk, "created_at") &&
    typeof chunk.created_at === "string" &&
    indirectHasOwnProperty(chunk, "updated_at") &&
    typeof chunk.updated_at === "string" &&
    indirectHasOwnProperty(chunk, "dataset_id") &&
    typeof chunk.dataset_id === "string" &&
    indirectHasOwnProperty(chunk, "weight") &&
    typeof chunk.weight === "number"
  );
}
```

These utility functions and type definitions provide a robust foundation for type safety and API interaction in the search frontend application.
