## Code Structure
The `HomeSearch` component is the main container, which includes:
- `Navbar` for navigation
- `SearchForm` for user input
- `ResultsPage` for displaying search results
- `Footer` for additional information

The component uses the `useSearch` hook for state management and the `createSignal` function for local state.

### HomeSearch
#### Description
The main component that assembles the search interface.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the search state using the `useSearch` hook
2. Creates a local state for rating queries
3. Renders the main layout, including navigation, search form, and results

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | For reactive programming and component creation |
| ./components/* | Various UI components used in the search interface |
| ./hooks/useSearch | Custom hook for managing search state |

## Future Improvements
- Consider breaking down the component into smaller, more manageable pieces if it grows in complexity
- Implement lazy loading for the ResultsPage component to improve initial load time
- Add error boundaries to handle potential errors in child components

This component serves as the main entry point for the search functionality, integrating various sub-components to create a cohesive user interface. It manages the overall state of the search and coordinates the interaction between the search form and results display.
