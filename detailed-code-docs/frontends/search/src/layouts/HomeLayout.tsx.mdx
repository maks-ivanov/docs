#### Internal Logic
1. **Theme Setting:**
   - Retrieves the preferred theme from localStorage if it exists.
   - If not, it checks the user's system preference for light or dark mode.
   - Applies the selected theme by adding or removing the "dark" class from the document's root element.

2. **Service Worker Registration:**
   - Checks if the browser supports service workers.
   - If supported, it registers the service worker located at "/sw.js".
   - Logs success or failure messages to the console.

3. **Component Rendering:**
   - Renders the `HomeSearch` component for the search bar functionality.
   - Renders the `ShowToast` component to display toast notifications.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the DOM by adding or removing the "dark" class on the document's root element.
- Registers a service worker, which can have side effects related to caching and offline functionality.

## Dependencies
- This code does not have external library dependencies.

## Error Handling
- The service worker registration includes basic error handling by logging errors to the console.

## Logging
- Logs success or failure messages for service worker registration to the console.
