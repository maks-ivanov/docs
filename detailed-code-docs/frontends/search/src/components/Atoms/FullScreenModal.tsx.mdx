## High-level description
The `FullScreenModal` component is a reusable modal component that covers the entire screen. It uses the `solid-headless` library for modal functionality and `solid-js/web` for portal rendering. The modal includes a semi-transparent overlay and a centered panel for displaying content.

## Table of contents
- `FullScreenModal`

## References
- `Portal` from `solid-js/web`
- `Dialog`, `DialogOverlay`, `DialogPanel`, `Transition`, `TransitionChild` from `solid-headless`

## Symbols
### `FullScreenModal`
#### Description
This component renders a full-screen modal dialog that appears on top of other content. It leverages the `solid-headless` library for managing the modal's state and transitions. The modal content is rendered within a `DialogPanel` and is centered on the screen. A semi-transparent overlay (`DialogOverlay`) is displayed behind the modal panel.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | JSX.Element | The content to be displayed within the modal panel |
| isOpen | Accessor&lt;boolean&gt; | An accessor function that returns a boolean indicating whether the modal is open |
| setIsOpen | Setter&lt;boolean&gt; \| ((open: boolean) =&gt; void) | A setter function or a function that takes a boolean argument to control the open state of the modal |

#### Outputs
This component does not have any explicit outputs. It renders the modal dialog directly to the DOM.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses a `Portal` to render the modal outside of the normal component hierarchy, allowing it to overlay other content.
2. A `Transition` component from `solid-headless` is used to manage the modal's appearance and disappearance with smooth transitions.
3. The `Dialog` component from `solid-headless` provides the basic modal structure and functionality.
4. The `isOpen` prop controls the visibility of the modal.
5. The `onClose` event handler of the `Dialog` component calls the `setIsOpen` function to close the modal when the user clicks outside of the modal panel.
6. The modal content is rendered within a `DialogPanel` which is styled to be centered on the screen.
7. A `DialogOverlay` is rendered behind the modal panel to create a semi-transparent overlay effect.
8. A `TransitionChild` component is used to apply smooth transitions to the opacity of the modal panel and overlay.

## Side Effects
This component modifies the DOM by rendering the modal dialog.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-headless | Provides modal dialog components and transition utilities |
| solid-js/web | Provides the `Portal` component for rendering outside the component hierarchy |
