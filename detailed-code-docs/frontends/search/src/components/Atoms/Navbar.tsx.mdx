## Symbols
### Symbol Name: `Navbar`
#### Description
This functional component renders the navigation bar for the Trieve application. It dynamically adjusts its layout based on screen size, collapsing navigation links into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
JSX representing the navigation bar.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Retrieves Context:** Uses the `DatasetAndUserContext` to access user information, organization details, and the currently selected dataset.
2. **Dynamic Links:** Constructs URLs for navigation links based on the currently selected dataset.
3. **Responsive Design:** Uses CSS media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.
4. **Hamburger Menu:** Implements a hamburger menu for smaller screens, toggling its visibility with the `isOpen` state.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | Core library for building the component and managing reactivity. |
| @solidjs/router | Used for accessing route parameters and navigating between pages. |
| solid-headless | Provides headless UI components for the dropdown menus. |
| solid-icons/fa | Provides the `FaSolidCheck` icon. |
| solid-icons/fi | Provides the `FiChevronDown` and `FiChevronUp` icons. |

## Side Effects
- Sets the `currentDataset` in local storage when it changes.
- Sets the `currentOrganization` in local storage when it changes.

## Future Improvements
- The navigation links could be extracted into a separate configuration file for easier maintenance and updates.
- The component could benefit from unit tests to ensure its functionality and responsiveness.
- Consider adding accessibility features, such as keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes, to improve usability for all users.
