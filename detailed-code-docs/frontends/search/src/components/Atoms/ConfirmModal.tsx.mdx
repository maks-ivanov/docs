## Symbols

### Symbol Name: `ConfirmModal`
#### Description
This component renders a full-screen modal dialog that prompts the user to confirm an action. It displays a confirmation message and two buttons: "Delete" and "Cancel". The modal's visibility is controlled by the `showConfirmModal` prop.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| showConfirmModal | Accessor&lt;boolean&gt; | An accessor function that returns a boolean indicating whether the modal should be visible. |
| setShowConfirmModal | Setter&lt;boolean&gt; | A setter function to update the visibility of the modal. |
| onConfirm | Accessor&lt;() =&gt; void&gt; | An accessor function that returns a function to be executed when the user confirms the action. |
| message | string | The confirmation message to be displayed in the modal. |

#### Outputs
This component doesn't have any direct outputs.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses the `Show` component from SolidJS to conditionally render the modal based on the value of `showConfirmModal`.
2. When visible, it renders the `FullScreenModal` component, passing the `showConfirmModal` and `setShowConfirmModal` props to control its visibility.
3. Inside the `FullScreenModal`, it displays:
    - A red "X" icon.
    - The confirmation message from the `message` prop, defaulting to "Are you sure you want to delete this?".
    - Two buttons:
        - **Delete:** When clicked, it:
            - Closes the modal by calling `setShowConfirmModal(false)`.
            - Executes the `onConfirm` function.
        - **Cancel:** When clicked, it closes the modal by calling `setShowConfirmModal(false)`.

## Side Effects
- This component doesn't have any direct side effects. However, the `onConfirm` function passed to it might cause side effects depending on its implementation.
