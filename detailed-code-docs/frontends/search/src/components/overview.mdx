## High-level description
This directory houses the atomic components for the Trieve search application's frontend, built using SolidJS. These components are designed for reusability and handle specific functionalities like message display, date picking, modal dialogs, pagination, and navigation. They serve as building blocks for more complex UI elements and contribute to a cohesive user experience.

## What does it do?
This directory provides the basic UI elements for the Trieve search application. Imagine you are building a house. This directory contains the bricks, windows, and doors that are used to construct the rooms of the house. These components are designed to be reusable and customizable, allowing developers to build complex and interactive user interfaces efficiently.

## Key Files
### `BookmarkPopover.tsx`
This component displays a popover that allows users to manage which groups a chunk belongs to. It displays a list of groups, a checkbox for adding/removing the chunk from each group, and buttons for creating new groups and navigating pages of groups.

### `ChatPopup.tsx`
This component displays a chat interface that allows users to interact with an AI assistant. It enables users to send messages, receive AI-generated responses, and view relevant chunks of information based on the conversation context.

### `ChunkMetadataDisplay.tsx`
This component is responsible for rendering the metadata and content of a single chunk. It provides functionality to expand/collapse the chunk content, view full metadata, delete the chunk, edit the chunk, and manage groups associated with the chunk.

### `CreateNewDocChunkForm.tsx`
This component provides a form for users to create new document chunks within a selected dataset. It handles user input for various chunk attributes, including content, metadata, and optional parameters like location and weight. The component interacts with the backend API to submit the new chunk data.

### `DatasetSelectBox.tsx`
This component displays a dropdown menu that allows users to select a dataset from a list of available datasets. It provides a search bar for filtering datasets and displays a checkmark next to the currently selected dataset.

### `EditChunkPageForm.tsx`
This component provides a form for editing the metadata and content of a document chunk. It allows users to modify various attributes of a chunk, such as its link, tags, metadata, location, and content. The component handles form submission, validation, and updates the chunk data via API calls.

### `FilterModal.tsx`
This component renders a modal dialog that allows users to refine their search results using various filters. Users can specify criteria such as keywords, date ranges, and metadata fields to narrow down the results.

### `Footer.tsx`
This component renders the footer section of the application. It includes links to various social media platforms, an email address, and a theme mode controller.

### `GroupPage.tsx`
This component displays information and chunks associated with a specific chunk group. It allows users to view, edit, delete, and search within the group, as well as fetch recommendations for related chunks or groups.

### `ImageModal.tsx`
This component displays a full-screen modal containing a series of images fetched from a specified range. It retrieves signed URLs for each image in the range and renders them within the modal.

### `OrgGroupPageView.tsx`
This component displays a paginated list of chunk groups associated with a specific dataset. It allows users to view group details, delete groups, and download associated files if the feature is enabled. The component fetches group data, handles user interactions, and provides navigation between pages.

### `OrganizationSelectBox.tsx`
This component displays a dropdown menu that allows the user to select an organization from a list. The selected organization is used to filter the list of datasets displayed in the `DatasetSelectBox` component. The component also displays the currently selected organization.

### `ResultsPage.tsx`
This component is responsible for displaying the results of a search query. It handles loading and displaying search results, pagination, and interactions with individual result chunks, including bookmarking, deleting, and expanding. It also provides functionality for chatting with selected results using a chat popup.

### `ScoreChunk.tsx`
This component displays a single chunk of data with its associated score, metadata, and actions. It allows users to expand/collapse the chunk content, view metadata, delete the chunk, and manage its group memberships.

### `SearchForm.tsx`
This component renders a search form that allows users to input search queries, apply filters, select search types, sort results, and configure various search options. It manages the search state and interacts with the `useSearch` hook to update and execute searches.

### `ShowToasts.tsx`
This component manages the display of toast notifications within the application. It listens for custom "show-toast" events triggered by other components and renders toasts accordingly. Each toast displays a message and a type (success or error) and disappears after a short timeout.

### `SingleChunkPage.tsx`
This component renders a single chunk of a document, along with its metadata and related chunks. It allows users to view, edit, and delete chunks, as well as interact with them through features like bookmarking and chat.

### `ThemeModeController.tsx`
This component provides a user interface for switching between light, dark, and system theme modes, persisting the user's choice in local storage.

### `TinyEditor.tsx`
This component is a wrapper around TinyMCE, a rich text editor, providing a user interface for creating and editing HTML content. It allows for customization of appearance, functionality, and behavior through various options.

### `UploadFile.tsx`
This component provides a user interface for uploading files to the Trieve platform. It allows users to select multiple files or folders, specify optional metadata, and initiate the upload process. The component also handles file validation, displays upload progress, and provides feedback on the upload status.

## Dependencies
This directory relies heavily on SolidJS and its ecosystem for building reactive and efficient UI components. Key dependencies include:

- `solid-js`: The core SolidJS library for component creation, state management, and reactivity.
- `solid-headless`: Provides unstyled, accessible UI components for building custom designs.
- `@solidjs/router`: Enables routing and navigation within the application.
- `solid-icons`: Offers a collection of icons from various icon sets for visual elements.
- `sanitize-html`: Sanitizes HTML content to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- `@nozbe/microfuzz`: Implements fuzzy search functionality for filtering datasets.
- `tinymce`: A powerful rich text editor integrated into the `TinyEditor` component.

These dependencies are crucial for building a robust and feature-rich frontend for the Trieve search application.
