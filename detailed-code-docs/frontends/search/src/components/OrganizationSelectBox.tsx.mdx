The selected organization is used to filter the list of datasets displayed in the `DatasetSelectBox` component. The component also displays the currently selected organization.

## Table of contents
- Imports
- Component Definition (`OrganizationSelectBox`)

## Code Structure
The `OrganizationSelectBox` component uses the `DatasetAndUserContext` to access the list of organizations and the currently selected organization. The component uses the `Popover` component from the `solid-headless` library to display the dropdown menu. The `Menu` and `MenuItem` components from the `solid-headless` library are used to display the list of organizations. The `FaSolidCheck` icon is used to indicate the currently selected organization.

## References
- `DatasetAndUserContext`: Provides access to the list of organizations, the currently selected organization, and the function to set the currently selected organization.

## Symbols

### Symbol Name
```typescript
OrganizationSelectBox
```

#### Description
This is a functional component that renders a dropdown menu for selecting an organization. It displays the currently selected organization's name and allows users to choose from a list of available organizations.

#### Inputs
This component does not take any explicit props.

#### Outputs
This component renders a dropdown menu for selecting an organization.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Retrieves Data from Context:** It uses the `DatasetAndUserContext` to access the list of organizations (`organizations`), the currently selected organization (`currentOrganization`), and the function to update the selected organization (`setCurrentOrganization`).
2. **Manages Dropdown State:** It utilizes the `Popover` component from `solid-headless` to manage the open/closed state of the dropdown menu.
3. **Renders Organization List:** It iterates through the `organizationsList` and renders a `MenuItem` for each organization.
4. **Handles Organization Selection:** When an organization is selected:
    - It prevents default event behavior.
    - It updates the `currentOrganization` in the context using `setCurrentOrganization`.
    - It closes the dropdown menu.
5. **Indicates Selected Organization:** It visually marks the currently selected organization in the list using a checkmark icon (`FaSolidCheck`).

## Side Effects
This component updates the `currentOrganization` state in the `DatasetAndUserContext` when the user selects a new organization. This change will likely trigger updates in other components that rely on the `currentOrganization` state.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | Core library for building the component and its logic. |
| solid-headless | Provides headless UI components like `Menu`, `MenuItem`, `Popover`, etc. |
| solid-icons/fa | Provides the `FaSolidCheck` icon. |
| solid-icons/fi | Provides the `FiChevronDown` and `FiChevronUp` icons. |
| ./Contexts/DatasetAndUserContext | Provides access to shared data and functions related to datasets and user context. |

## Future Improvements
- **Accessibility:** Enhance the component's accessibility by adding keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes for screen readers.
- **Styling:** Consider extracting the inline styles to a separate CSS file or using a CSS-in-JS library for better maintainability and separation of concerns.
- **Loading State:** Implement a loading state while fetching the list of organizations to improve the user experience.
- **Error Handling:** Add error handling to gracefully handle situations where fetching organizations fails.
