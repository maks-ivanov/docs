## High-level description
The `SearchForm` component renders a search form that allows users to input search queries, apply filters, select search types, sort results, and configure various search options. It manages the search state and interacts with the `useSearch` hook to update and execute searches.

## Table of contents
- Search Input
- Filters
- Search Type Selection
- Sort Options
- Rerank Options
- Search Options
- Multi-Query Option
- Rate Search Button
- Group Search Checkbox

## Code Structure
The `SearchForm` component utilizes several SolidJS primitives like `createSignal`, `createEffect`, `createMemo`, `Show`, `Switch`, `Match`, and `For` to manage its state, reactivity, and rendering logic. It also uses components from the `solid-headless` library for handling popovers and menus.

## References
- `useSearch`: A custom hook that manages the search state and logic.
- `Filter`: A component that represents a single search filter.
- `Tooltip`: A component that displays tooltips for UI elements.

### `SearchForm`
#### Description
This functional component renders a search form with various options for customizing the search.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | { search: SearchStore; groupID?: string; openRateQueryModal: Setter&lt;boolean&gt;; } | An object containing the search store, optional group ID, and a setter function to open the rate query modal. |

#### Outputs
JSX Element representing the search form.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Initializes state variables:**
    - `tempSearchValues`: Holds temporary search options before they are committed to the `useSearch` hook.
    - `tempFilterType`: Stores the currently selected filter type ("must", "must not", "should").
    - `mustFilters`, `mustNotFilters`, `shouldFilters`: Store arrays of filters for each filter type.
    - `jsonbPrefilter`: A boolean indicating whether to use JSONB prefiltering.
    - `rerankQuery`: Stores the query used for reranking.
    - `searchTypes`: An array of available search types.
    - `sortTypes`: An array of available sort types.
    - `rerankTypes`: An array of available rerank types.
2. **Reacts to changes in search state:**
    - Updates the selected search type, sort type, and rerank type based on the `search` store.
3. **Handles form submissions:**
    - Updates the `search` store with the current search query and increments the version.
4. **Manages filters:**
    - Provides UI for adding, removing, and updating filters.
    - Updates the `search` store with the applied filters.
5. **Manages search options:**
    - Provides UI for configuring search options like score threshold, page size, highlight options, etc.
    - Updates the `search` store with the selected options.
6. **Handles multi-query search:**
    - Provides UI for adding and removing multiple queries with weights.
    - Updates the `search` store with the multi-query configuration.
7. **Handles group search:**
    - Provides a checkbox to toggle group search mode.
    - Updates the `search` store with the group search setting.
8. **Renders the search form UI:**
    - Uses SolidJS's `Show` and `Switch` components to conditionally render different parts of the form based on the current state.

## Side Effects
- Updates the URL search parameters with the current search state.
- Updates the `useSearch` hook with the current search state.

## Future Improvements
- **Refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability:** The code could be better organized into smaller, more focused functions. For example, the logic for handling filters, search options, and multi-query search could be extracted into separate functions.
- **Improve the UI/UX of the search form:** The form could be made more user-friendly by using more intuitive controls and providing better feedback to the user. For example, the filter section could be redesigned to be more visually appealing and easier to use.
- **Add support for more advanced search features:** The search form could be extended to support more advanced features such as fuzzy matching, proximity search, and regular expressions.
- **Improve error handling:** The code could be more robust by adding error handling for network requests and other potential points of failure.
- **Add more comprehensive unit tests:** The code could benefit from more comprehensive unit tests to ensure that it is working as expected.
