#### Internal Logic
1. **Initialization:**
   - Fetches bookmarks for the chunks in the group.
   - Sets up effects to fetch group data, chunk groups, and recommendations based on changes in search parameters, page number, and dataset.
2. **Group Data Fetching:**
   - Fetches group information and chunks based on the `groupID` and current page.
   - Handles search within the group if a search query is provided.
3. **Chunk Group Fetching:**
   - Fetches the list of chunk groups for the authenticated user.
4. **Bookmark Fetching:**
   - Fetches bookmarks for the displayed chunks.
5. **Group Information Updating:**
   - Allows users to edit and update the group name and description.
6. **Recommendation Fetching:**
   - Fetches recommendations for related chunks or groups based on user selection.
7. **Rendering:**
   - Displays group information, a search form, the list of chunks, pagination controls, and recommendations.
   - Includes a chat popup for interacting with selected chunks.
   - Shows confirmation modals for deleting chunks or the entire group.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the URL search parameters based on changes in search options.
- Fetches data from the API for group information, chunks, chunk groups, bookmarks, and recommendations.
