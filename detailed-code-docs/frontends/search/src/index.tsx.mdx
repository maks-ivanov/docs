## High-level description
This code is the main entry point for a React-based web application. It sets up the routing structure, initializes Sentry for error tracking in production, and renders the application's components within a context wrapper.

## Table of contents
- Imports
- NotFoundRedirect component
- Sentry initialization
- Root element selection
- Application rendering with routing

## Code Structure
The main symbols in this code are interconnected as follows:
- The `render` function is the core, which renders the entire application.
- The `Router` component wraps all routes and is contained within the `DatasetAndUserContextWrapper`.
- Individual route components (e.g., `Home`, `Upload`, `CreateChunk`) are referenced within the `Route` components.

## References
This code references several other parts of the codebase:
- Layout components: `HomeLayout`
- Page components: `Upload`, `CreateChunk`, `EditChunk`, `ViewChunk`, `ViewGroup`, `OrgGroups`
- Context components: `DatasetAndUserContextWrapper`

## Symbols

### NotFoundRedirect
#### Description
A component that redirects to the home page when a route is not found.

#### Outputs
Returns an empty JSX fragment.

#### Side Effects
Redirects the browser to the root URL ("/").

### render
#### Description
The main function that renders the entire application.

#### Inputs
- A function that returns the JSX for the application
- The root DOM element to render into

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the router with all defined routes
2. Wraps the router in the `DatasetAndUserContextWrapper`
3. Renders the application to the specified root element

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js/web | Provides the `render` function for rendering the application |
| @solidjs/router | Provides routing functionality |
| @sentry/browser | Error tracking and monitoring |

## Error Handling
Sentry is initialized for error tracking in non-development environments. It's configured to capture browser traces and session replays.

## Future Improvements
- Consider implementing lazy loading for route components to improve initial load time.
- Add more specific error boundaries around critical components.
- Implement a more robust 404 handling strategy, possibly with a dedicated NotFound page.
