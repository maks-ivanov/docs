## High-level description
The `Upload.tsx` component provides a user interface for uploading files to the Trieve platform. It allows users to select multiple files or folders, specify optional metadata, and initiate the upload process.

## Table of contents
- Import statements
- `Upload` component

## Symbols
### Symbol Name: `Upload`
#### Description:
This functional component renders the UI for the file upload page. It displays a logo, a title, a warning message about upload times, and the `UploadFile` component. It is responsible for rendering the layout of the upload page within the `SearchLayout`.

#### Inputs:
None

#### Outputs:
JSX.Element representing the rendered upload page.

#### Internal Logic:
The component uses the `SearchLayout` component to structure the page. It displays a logo, a title, a warning message, and the `UploadFile` component.

## References
- `SearchLayout`: Provides the basic layout for search-related pages.
- `UploadFile`: Handles the actual file selection, metadata input, and upload logic.
- `Footer`: Displays the footer of the application.

## Dependencies
None explicitly listed. However, it uses components from the application (`SearchLayout`, `UploadFile`, `Footer`) and likely relies on external libraries like SolidJS for UI rendering and potentially others for styling and network requests.
