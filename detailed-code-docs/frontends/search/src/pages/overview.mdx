## High-level description
The `frontends/search/src/pages` directory contains the main user interface components for a search application built with SolidJS. Each file in this directory represents a distinct page or view within the application, responsible for handling user interactions, fetching data, and rendering the UI.

## What does it do?
This directory acts as the presentation layer of the search application, defining how users interact with the underlying search functionality and data. The components within this directory handle tasks such as:

- Displaying search results
- Uploading and managing documents
- Creating and editing document chunks
- Viewing and managing groups of chunks
- Handling application errors (e.g., 404 Not Found)

Each page component is responsible for fetching the necessary data from the backend API, managing its own state and UI logic, and rendering the appropriate view for the user.

## Entry points
While there are multiple files in this directory, each representing a different page, the main entry points for a user would typically be:

- `Upload.tsx`: This component provides the interface for users to upload new documents to the search index.
- `CreateChunk.tsx`: This component allows users to manually create new chunks of data, which can be grouped and associated with datasets.

From these entry points, users can then navigate to other pages like `ViewChunk.tsx`, `EditChunk.tsx`, `OrgGroups.tsx`, or `ViewGroup.tsx` to interact with specific data or manage existing content.

## Key Files

### `chunk` subdirectory
This subdirectory contains components specifically for viewing and editing individual chunks of data. It provides two main components:

- `ViewChunk.tsx`: Renders a read-only view of a single chunk, displaying its content and metadata.
- `EditChunk.tsx`: Provides an interface for modifying the content and metadata of an existing chunk.

These components are typically accessed through the application's routing system when a user navigates to a specific chunk's view or edit page.

### `group` subdirectory
This subdirectory focuses on managing and displaying groups of chunks. It includes two primary components:

- `OrgGroups.tsx`: Displays a paginated list of all chunk groups associated with a dataset, allowing users to view group details, delete groups, and download associated files.
- `ViewGroup.tsx`: Renders a detailed view of a single group, showing its information, chunk metadata, and options for editing or deleting the group.

These components work together to provide a comprehensive interface for managing and interacting with chunk groups within the search application.
