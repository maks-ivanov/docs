title: ".eslintrc.json"
---

## High-level description
This `.eslintrc.json` file configures ESLint for the search frontend of a project. It sets up linting rules and environments for a TypeScript-based Solid.js application, ensuring code quality and consistency across the codebase.

## Table of contents
- Environment configuration
- Extended configurations
- Parser settings
- Plugins
- Custom rules
- Overrides
- Ignored patterns

## Code Structure
The configuration is structured as a JSON object with various properties defining the ESLint setup. The main sections include environment settings, extended configurations, parser options, plugins, custom rules, and ignore patterns.

## Symbols

### `env`
#### Description
Specifies the environments where the code is intended to run.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| browser | boolean | Indicates that the code is meant to run in a browser environment |

### `extends`
#### Description
An array of ESLint configurations to extend from, including recommended settings for TypeScript and Solid.js.

### `parser`
#### Description
Specifies the parser to be used for analyzing the code.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| @typescript-eslint/parser | string | The TypeScript ESLint parser |

### `parserOptions`
#### Description
Configures the parser options, specifically pointing to the TypeScript configuration file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| project | array of strings | Paths to the TypeScript configuration files |

### `plugins`
#### Description
Lists the ESLint plugins to be used, including TypeScript and Solid.js specific plugins.

### `rules`
#### Description
Defines custom ESLint rules and their severity levels.

#### Internal Logic
- Configures Prettier to use 'auto' for end of line characters
- Sets TypeScript ban-ts-comment to 'warn'
- Configures no-unused-vars with specific ignore patterns for different variable types

### `overrides`
#### Description
An empty array, potentially for future use to specify rule overrides for specific files or directories.

### `ignorePatterns`
#### Description
Lists files and directories that should be ignored by ESLint.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @typescript-eslint/parser | Parsing TypeScript code |
| @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin | TypeScript-specific linting rules |
| eslint-plugin-solid | Solid.js specific linting rules |
| eslint-plugin-prettier | Integration with Prettier for code formatting |

## Future Improvements
- The `overrides` array is currently empty. This could be utilized to apply specific rules to different file types or directories within the project.
- Consider adding more specific rules for Solid.js best practices as the project evolves.
- Evaluate the need for additional plugins or rule configurations based on project requirements and team preferences.
- Regularly update the ESLint and plugin versions to leverage new features and improvements in linting capabilities.
