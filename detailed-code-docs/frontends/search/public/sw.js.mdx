## High-level description
This file contains a basic service worker implementation for a web application. It sets up event listeners for the install, activate, and fetch events, but currently does not perform any actions in response to these events.

## Table of contents
- Install event listener
- Activate event listener
- Fetch event listener

## Code Structure
The code consists of three event listeners attached to the `self` object, which represents the service worker itself. Each listener is set up for a different lifecycle event of the service worker.

## Symbols

### `self.addEventListener("install", (event) =&gt; {})`
#### Description
This sets up an event listener for the "install" event, which is triggered when the service worker is being installed.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| event | InstallEvent | The install event object |

#### Internal Logic
Currently, this listener does not perform any actions.

### `self.addEventListener("activate", (event) =&gt; {})`
#### Description
This sets up an event listener for the "activate" event, which is triggered when the service worker is being activated.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| event | ActivateEvent | The activate event object |

#### Internal Logic
Currently, this listener does not perform any actions.

### `self.addEventListener("fetch", (event) =&gt; {})`
#### Description
This sets up an event listener for the "fetch" event, which is triggered when the service worker intercepts a network request.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| event | FetchEvent | The fetch event object |

#### Internal Logic
Currently, this listener does not perform any actions.

## Future Improvements
1. Implement caching strategies in the "install" event listener to cache static assets for offline use.
2. Add logic in the "activate" event listener to clean up old caches or perform any necessary updates.
3. Implement request interception and caching logic in the "fetch" event listener to serve cached responses or handle offline scenarios.
4. Consider adding error handling and logging mechanisms to track service worker behavior.
5. Implement push notification handling if the application requires it.

This service worker file serves as a skeleton for implementing more advanced functionality. Currently, it sets up the basic structure but does not provide any actual service worker features like caching, offline support, or push notifications. To make it useful, specific logic needs to be added to each event listener based on the application's requirements.
