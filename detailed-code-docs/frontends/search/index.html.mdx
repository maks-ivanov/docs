## High-level description
This HTML file defines the structure and content of the main search page for Trieve. It sets up the basic HTML skeleton, includes necessary scripts and stylesheets, and handles theme settings and service worker registration.

## Table of contents
- Head Section
- Body Section

## References
- `/src/index.tsx`: This file is referenced as the entry point for the JavaScript code, suggesting it contains the main application logic.
- `/sw.js`: This file is referenced as the service worker, indicating the application leverages service worker functionality for offline support or background tasks.

## Symbols
### `&lt;head&gt;`
#### Description
This section contains metadata and links to external resources for the HTML document.

#### Internal Logic
- **Theme Handling:**
    - Retrieves the preferred theme (light or dark) from localStorage or uses the browser's preferred color scheme.
    - Applies the selected theme by toggling the `dark` class on the `&lt;html&gt;` element.
- **Service Worker Registration:**
    - Registers the service worker located at `/sw.js` when the window loads.
    - Logs success or failure messages to the console.
- **External Resource Inclusion:**
    - Includes the TinyMCE editor script from a CDN.
    - Links a stylesheet for the Maven Pro font from Google Fonts.
    - Links the application manifest, favicon, and Apple touch icon.
    - Sets the theme color for the application.
    - Includes a script from `plausible.trieve.ai` for analytics or tracking.

### `&lt;body&gt;`
#### Description
This section contains the visible content of the HTML document.

#### Internal Logic
- **Root Element:**
    - Defines a `&lt;div&gt;` element with the id `root`. This likely serves as the main container where the SolidJS application will be mounted.
- **JavaScript Entry Point:**
    - Includes the main JavaScript file (`/src/index.tsx`) using a `&lt;script&gt;` tag with `type="module"`. This indicates the use of ES modules for JavaScript code organization.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| TinyMCE | Rich text editing functionality (likely used for composing search queries or displaying results). |
| Maven Pro (Google Fonts) | Custom font for the application's typography. |
| plausible.trieve.ai | Analytics or tracking script. |

## Configuration
- **Theme:** The preferred theme (light/dark) can be set by the user or determined automatically based on browser preferences.
- **Service Worker:** The service worker is registered at `/sw.js`, enabling offline support and background tasks.

## Logging
- The code logs messages to the console related to:
    - Successful or failed service worker registration.

## Future Improvements
- **Accessibility:** Conduct an accessibility audit to ensure the page meets WCAG guidelines for users with disabilities.
- **Performance:** Consider lazy loading the TinyMCE script to improve initial page load time.
- **SEO:** Add more descriptive meta tags, such as `keywords` and `author`, to improve search engine visibility.
