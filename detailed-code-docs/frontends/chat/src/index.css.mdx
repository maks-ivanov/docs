### Tailwind CSS Imports
#### Description
The file begins by importing Tailwind CSS base, components, and utilities.

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

These directives include Tailwind's pre-defined styles and utility classes, providing a foundation for the application's styling.

### ScoreChunk Styling
#### Description
A series of CSS rules are defined to style elements within an element with the ID "scoreChunk". These rules primarily focus on highlighting and formatting text.

#### Internal Logic
1. Styles for marked content within divs:
```css
#scoreChunk mark &gt; div &gt; * {
  background-color: #fffebd;
  color: #000;
  font-weight: bolder;
  width: fit-content;
}
```
This rule applies to all elements that are children of a div, which is a direct child of a mark element within #scoreChunk.

2. Styles for paragraphs within marked content:
```css
#scoreChunk mark &gt; p {
  background-color: #fffebd;
  color: #000;
  font-weight: bolder;
  width: fit-content;
}
```

3. General style for mark elements:
```css
#scoreChunk mark {
  background-color: #fffebd;
}
```

4. Styles for heading elements within bold, marked content:
```css
#scoreChunk b &gt; mark &gt; h1,
#scoreChunk b &gt; mark &gt; h2,
#scoreChunk b &gt; mark &gt; h3,
#scoreChunk b &gt; mark &gt; h4,
#scoreChunk b &gt; mark &gt; h5,
#scoreChunk b &gt; mark &gt; h6 {
  background-color: #fffebd;
  color: #000;
  font-weight: bolder;
  width: fit-content;
}
```

These rules consistently apply a light yellow background (#fffebd), black text color, bold font weight, and fit-content width to various elements within the "scoreChunk" section.

### Debug Class
#### Description
A utility class for debugging purposes is defined.

```css
.debug {
  outline: 1px solid red;
}
```

This class adds a thin red outline to any element it's applied to, which can be useful for visualizing element boundaries during development.

## Future Improvements
1. Consider using CSS custom properties (variables) for repeated values like colors and font weights to improve maintainability.
2. Evaluate the specificity of selectors in the "scoreChunk" section. Some rules might be consolidated or simplified for better performance and readability.
3. If the "scoreChunk" styles are specific to a particular component, consider moving them to a component-specific CSS file for better organization.
4. Add comments to explain the purpose of the "scoreChunk" styles and any non-obvious styling decisions.
5. Consider using Tailwind's @apply directive to create reusable component classes for common style combinations in the "scoreChunk" section.
