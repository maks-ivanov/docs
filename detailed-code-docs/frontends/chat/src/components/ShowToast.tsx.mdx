## High-level description
This code defines a `ShowToast` component and related functionality for displaying toast notifications in a React application. It uses SolidJS for state management and rendering, and includes utility functions for creating and managing toast messages.

## Table of contents
- createToast function
- ShowToast component
- Toast rendering logic
- Toast styling and icons

## Code Structure
The main symbols in this code are:
1. `createToast`: A function to dispatch custom events for showing toasts.
2. `ShowToast`: The main component that manages and renders toast notifications.
These symbols are interconnected, with `createToast` being used to trigger the display of toasts that are then managed and rendered by the `ShowToast` component.

## Symbols

### `createToast`
#### Description
A utility function that creates and dispatches a custom event to show a toast notification.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| { type, message } | ToastDetail | An object containing the type and message of the toast |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new CustomEvent named "show-toast"
2. Sets the event detail with the provided type and message
3. Dispatches the event on the window object

### `ShowToast`
#### Description
A component that manages and renders toast notifications.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `createSignal` to manage the state of toast details
2. Sets up an effect to listen for "show-toast" events
3. Adds new toasts to the state when events are received
4. Automatically removes toasts after 5 seconds
5. Renders toasts using a `For` loop from SolidJS
6. Applies different styles based on the toast type (success or error)
7. Provides a close button for each toast

#### Outputs
Renders a div containing toast notifications with appropriate styling and icons.

## Side Effects
- Listens for custom "show-toast" events on the window object
- Sets and clears timeouts for automatic toast removal

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | For reactive state management and component rendering |
| solid-icons/bs | For the success icon (BsCheck2Circle) |
| solid-icons/bi | For the error icon (BiRegularErrorCircle) |
| solid-icons/vs | For the close icon (VsClose) |

## Error Handling
The component doesn't implement specific error handling beyond basic exception raising.

## Future Improvements
1. Add support for more toast types (e.g., warning, info)
2. Implement a queue system for managing multiple toasts
3. Allow customization of toast duration
4. Add animations for toast appearance and disappearance
5. Implement accessibility features (e.g., ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
