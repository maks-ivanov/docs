## Code Structure
The main `Navbar` component uses several state variables and functions passed as props. It interacts with the `UserContext` for user-related data and makes API calls to update topic names. The component renders different UI elements based on the current state (e.g., editing mode, loading state).

#### Description
The main functional component that renders the navigation bar.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | NavbarProps | An object containing various props for the Navbar component |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes state variables for editing, edited content, and UI controls.
2. Defines functions for editing, saving, and canceling edits to the topic name.
3. Uses `createEffect` to manage side effects related to UI updates and topic changes.
4. Renders the navigation bar with conditional UI elements based on the current state.

### `editTitle`
#### Description
Function to enter editing mode for the topic title.

### `saveTitle`
#### Description
Asynchronous function to save the edited topic title.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the current dataset and selected topic.
2. Makes an API call to update the topic name.
3. Updates the local state and refetches topics if successful.

### `handleSaveTitle`
#### Description
Wrapper function to call `saveTitle` and handle potential errors.

### `cancelEdit`
#### Description
Function to exit editing mode without saving changes.

## Side Effects
- Updates the checkmark icon visibility based on the edited content.
- Resets the editing state when the selected topic changes.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| solid-js | For reactive state management and component rendering |
| solid-icons/bi | For icon components used in the navbar |

## Error Handling
The component logs errors to the console when updating the topic name fails.

## Future Improvements
- Implement more robust error handling and user feedback for failed API calls.
- Consider adding a loading state for the save operation to improve user experience.
- Implement a debounce mechanism for the title editing to reduce unnecessary API calls.
