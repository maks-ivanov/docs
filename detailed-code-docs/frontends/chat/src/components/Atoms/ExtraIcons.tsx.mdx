### `TrieveLogo`
#### Description
`TrieveLogo` is a functional React component that returns an `img` element. The image source is set to a specific URL pointing to the Trieve logo hosted on a CDN.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing an `img` tag.

#### Internal Logic
The component simply returns an `img` element with the following attributes:
- `src`: Set to "https://cdn.trieve.ai/trieve-logo.png"
- `alt`: Set to an empty string

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Implicit dependency for creating the functional component |

## Future Improvements
1. Consider adding props to allow customization of the logo size, such as `width` and `height`.
2. Implement error handling for cases where the image fails to load.
3. Add lazy loading attribute to improve performance for pages with multiple images.
4. Consider using a local asset instead of a CDN-hosted image to reduce external dependencies.

Example of potential enhancement:

```typescript
interface TrieveLogoProps {
  width?: number;
  height?: number;
}

export const TrieveLogo: React.FC&lt;TrieveLogoProps&gt; = ({ width, height }) =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;img
      src="https://cdn.trieve.ai/trieve-logo.png"
      alt="Trieve Logo"
      width={width}
      height={height}
      loading="lazy"
      onError={(e) =&gt; {
        e.currentTarget.src = 'path/to/fallback-image.png';
      }}
    /&gt;
  );
};
```

This enhanced version would allow for more flexibility and better error handling while improving performance through lazy loading.
