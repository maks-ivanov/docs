## Configuration
The components in this directory do not rely heavily on configuration files or environment variables. However, some components, such as OnScreenThemeModeController, use local storage to persist user preferences for theme modes.

Key configurable aspects include:
1. Theme modes: Users can switch between light, dark, and system-defined themes.
2. Dataset and organization selection: Users can choose from available datasets and organizations.
3. Message rendering: The AfMessage component supports various roles and content types, which can be configured through props.

To further enhance the configurability of these components, consider implementing a centralized configuration system that allows for easy customization of default values, styling options, and feature toggles.

In conclusion, this directory provides a set of versatile and reusable components that form the foundation of the chat interface. These components handle essential functionalities while remaining flexible and customizable to meet the specific needs of the application.
