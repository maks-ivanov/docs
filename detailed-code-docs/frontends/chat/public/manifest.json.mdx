### Icons Array
#### Description
An array of icon objects that define the app's icons for different sizes and purposes.

#### Inputs
Each icon object in the array has the following properties:
| Name | Type | Description |

| sizes | string | The dimensions of the icon |
| type | string | The MIME type of the icon image |
| purpose | string (optional) | The purpose of the icon (e.g., "any maskable icon") |

## Dependencies
This manifest file does not have any direct code dependencies, as it is a JSON configuration file used by web browsers and operating systems to understand how to display and behave when the PWA is installed.

## Configuration
The manifest.json file itself serves as a configuration for the PWA. Key configurations include:

| Option | Type | Value | Description |

| theme_color | string | "#292d30" | The primary theme color for the app's UI |

## Future Improvements
1. Add more icon sizes to support a wider range of devices and pixel densities.
2. Include a `screenshots` array to showcase the app's appearance in app stores.
3. Add `categories` to help classify the app in app stores.
4. Implement `share_target` to enable the app to receive shared content from other apps.
5. Consider adding `shortcuts` for quick access to specific features of the app.
