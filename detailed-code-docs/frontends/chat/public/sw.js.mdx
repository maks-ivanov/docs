## High-level description
This file contains a basic Service Worker implementation with empty event listeners for installation, activation, and fetch events. It serves as a minimal placeholder for potential future Service Worker functionality in a web application.

## Table of contents
- Service Worker event listeners
  - Install event
  - Activate event
  - Fetch event

## Symbols

### `self.addEventListener("install", (_event) =&gt; {})`
#### Description
This event listener is triggered when the Service Worker is being installed. Currently, it does not perform any actions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| _event | Event | The install event object (unused) |

### `self.addEventListener("activate", (_event) =&gt; {})`
#### Description
This event listener is triggered when the Service Worker is being activated. Currently, it does not perform any actions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| _event | Event | The activate event object (unused) |

### `self.addEventListener("fetch", (_event) =&gt; {})`
#### Description
This event listener is triggered when the Service Worker intercepts a fetch request. Currently, it does not perform any actions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| _event | FetchEvent | The fetch event object (unused) |

## Future Improvements
1. Implement caching strategies in the fetch event listener to improve offline functionality.
2. Add logic to the install event listener to cache essential assets for offline use.
3. Implement cleanup of old caches in the activate event listener.
4. Add push notification handling capabilities.
5. Implement background sync functionality for offline data submission.

## Dependencies
This Service Worker script does not have any external dependencies.

## Error Handling
Currently, there is no specific error handling implemented in this Service Worker.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are currently implemented in this Service Worker.

Note: The comment at the top of the file disables the ESLint rule for unused variables, which is necessary because the event parameters are currently unused but may be needed in future implementations.
