## High-level description
The `frontends/analytics` directory contains the source code and configuration files for the analytics frontend of the Trieve application. This frontend is built using SolidJS and provides a comprehensive dashboard for analyzing search performance, user behavior, and content relevance. It utilizes modern web technologies and offers a flexible, interactive interface for data exploration and analysis.

## What does it do?
The analytics frontend allows users to:

1. View overall system performance metrics such as requests per second, top queries, and query counts.
2. Analyze search functionality, including usage patterns, latency, top queries, low-confidence queries, and queries with no results.
3. Investigate RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) usage, filtering and visualizing RAG queries by date range and type.
4. Discover and analyze trending search topics and associated queries.
5. Explore click-through rate (CTR) analytics for search results.
6. Navigate through different analytics views using a tabbed interface and sidebar navigation.
7. Filter and customize data views based on date ranges, search methods, and query types.
8. Authenticate users and manage organization-specific data access.

The application fetches data from various API endpoints, processes it, and presents it through interactive charts, tables, and other visualizations.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the application is `src/index.tsx`, which sets up the routing, context providers, and renders the main application structure. The `src/pages` directory contains the individual page components that serve as entry points for different views within the application.

## Key Files
1. `src/api/`: Contains modules for interacting with backend API endpoints, handling data fetching for analytics, CTR, search queries, and trends.

2. `src/components/`: Houses reusable UI components, including charts, filter controls, and navigation elements.

3. `src/contexts/`: Provides context providers for user authentication and organization selection.

4. `src/hooks/`: Contains custom hooks for pagination management, CTR setup checking, and URL pathname access.

5. `src/layouts/`: Defines the overall layout structure of the application, including the top bar and data explorer tabs.

6. `src/pages/`: Contains the main page components for different analytics views, such as overview, search analytics, RAG analytics, and trend explorer.

7. `src/utils/`: Offers utility functions for API host configuration, date formatting, string manipulation, and enhanced navigation.

8. `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the application.

9. `vite.config.ts`: Configures the Vite build tool for the project, including plugins for SolidJS support and runtime environment variables.

## Dependencies
The application relies on several key dependencies:

1. SolidJS: The core library for building the reactive user interface.
2. @solidjs/router: Handles routing and navigation within the single-page application.
3. @tanstack/solid-query: Manages data fetching, caching, and state updates.
4. Chart.js: Provides charting capabilities for data visualization.
5. date-fns: Offers utilities for date manipulation and formatting.
6. Tailwind CSS: Used for styling the application.
7. Vite: The build tool and development server.
8. TypeScript: For static typing and improved developer experience.
9. ESLint: For code linting and maintaining code quality.
10. PostCSS: For processing CSS with plugins like Tailwind and Autoprefixer.

## Configuration
The application uses several configuration files:

1. `.eslintrc.json`: Configures ESLint for code linting, extending recommended configurations and setting up custom rules.

2. `tsconfig.json`: Configures TypeScript compiler options, extending a base configuration and disabling the `noUnusedLocals` check.

3. `vite.config.ts`: Configures the Vite build tool, setting up plugins for SolidJS and runtime environment variables.

4. `postcss.config.js`: Sets up PostCSS plugins, including Tailwind CSS and Autoprefixer.

5. `package.json`: Manages project dependencies and defines scripts for development, building, and linting.

The application also uses environment variables for configuration, particularly `VITE_API_HOST` for setting the API host URL. Other configuration aspects include URL parameters for dataset selection and filtering, and hardcoded arrays of pages and tabs for navigation.

In summary, this directory contains a comprehensive analytics frontend that provides deep insights into search and RAG performance, user behavior, and content relevance. It's built with modern web technologies and offers a flexible, interactive interface for data exploration and analysis.
