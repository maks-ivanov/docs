## High-level description
This code defines a custom SolidJS hook called `usePathname` that provides a reactive way to access the current pathname of the URL. It leverages the `useLocation` hook from the SolidJS router and uses `createMemo` to create a memoized, reactive value for the pathname.

## Symbols

### Symbol Name
`usePathname`

#### Description
This is a custom SolidJS hook that returns a reactive signal containing the current pathname of the URL. It retrieves the location object using `useLocation` and then uses `createMemo` to create a reactive, memoized value for the `pathname` property of the location object.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
- A reactive signal containing the current pathname (string).

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the current location object using `useLocation` hook.
2. Uses `createMemo` to create a reactive, memoized value for the `pathname` property of the location object. This ensures that the pathname value is updated whenever the location changes.
3. Returns the memoized `pathname` signal.

## References
- `useLocation` from "@solidjs/router"
- `createMemo` from "solid-js"

## Side Effects
This hook has no side effects. It simply reads from the router's state.

## Future Improvements
No improvements needed. This hook is concise and serves its purpose well.
