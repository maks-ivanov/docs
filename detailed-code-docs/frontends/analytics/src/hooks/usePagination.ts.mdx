## High-level description
The `usePagination` hook provides functionality for managing pagination state and actions within a SolidJS component. It offers signals for tracking the current page and the maximum discovered page, as well as methods for navigating pages and resetting the maximum page.

### `usePagination`
#### Description
This hook manages the pagination state and provides functions to interact with it.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| page | `Accesser&lt;number&gt;` | A signal representing the current page number. |
| nextPage | `() =&gt; void` | A function to increment the current page number. |
| prevPage | `() =&gt; void` | A function to decrement the current page number, only if the current page is greater than 1. |
| canGoNext | `Accessor&lt;boolean&gt;` | A computed value indicating whether there are potentially more pages to fetch. It checks if `maxPageDiscovered` is null or if the current page is less than `maxPageDiscovered`. |
| setMaxPageDiscovered | `(page: number \| null) =&gt; void` | A function to set the `maxPageDiscovered` signal. |
| resetMaxPageDiscovered | `() =&gt; void` | A function to reset the `maxPageDiscovered` signal to null. |
| maxPageDiscovered | `Accessor&lt;number \| null&gt;` | A signal representing the highest page number that has been successfully fetched data from. A value of null indicates that there is no known maximum page yet. |

#### Internal Logic
The hook uses SolidJS's `createSignal` and `createMemo` to manage state and compute derived values. 
- `page` signal is initialized to 1.
- `maxPageDiscovered` signal is initialized to null.
- `nextPage` increments the `page` signal.
- `prevPage` decrements the `page` signal, only if the current page is greater than 1.
- `canGoNext` checks if `maxPageDiscovered` is null or if the current page is less than `maxPageDiscovered`.
- `setMaxPageDiscovered` sets the value of the `maxPageDiscovered` signal.
- `resetMaxPageDiscovered` sets the value of the `maxPageDiscovered` signal to null.

## Side Effects
This hook has no side effects on its own. However, the functions it returns (e.g., `nextPage`, `prevPage`, `setMaxPageDiscovered`) will cause updates to the component's state when called, potentially triggering re-renders.

## References
This hook is used by several components related to displaying paginated data, such as `PaginationButtons`, `HeadQueries`, `LowConfidenceQueries`, `NoResultQueries`, `RagQueries`, and `SearchTablePage`. These components use the provided functions to navigate between pages and display relevant information based on the current pagination state.
