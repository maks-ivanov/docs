### `toTitleCase`
#### Description
This function takes a string as input and returns a new string transformed to title case. It achieves this by using a regular expression to match the first letter of each word and then using a callback function to capitalize the first letter and lowercase the rest of the word.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| str | string | The input string to be converted to title case. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | string | The input string converted to title case. |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function uses the `replace` method with a regular expression `/\w\S*/g` to match all words in the input string.
2. For each matched word, a callback function is executed.
3. The callback function takes the matched word as input (`text`).
4. It converts the first character of the word to uppercase using `text.charAt(0).toUpperCase()`.
5. It converts the remaining characters of the word to lowercase using `text.substring(1).toLowerCase()`.
6. The `replace` method replaces each matched word with the transformed word, resulting in the title-cased string.

## Side Effects
This function has no side effects. It does not modify the input string or any external state.

#### Performance Considerations
This function is generally performant for typical use cases. However, for very long strings, performance could be improved by using alternative string manipulation techniques.
