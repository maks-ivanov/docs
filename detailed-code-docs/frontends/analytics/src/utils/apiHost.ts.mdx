title: "apiHost.ts"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a single constant `apiHost` which represents the base URL of the API used by the application. It retrieves the value from the `VITE_API_HOST` environment variable, which is injected by Vite during build time.

## Table of contents
- `apiHost`

## References
- `import.meta.env.VITE_API_HOST`: This reference accesses the `VITE_API_HOST` environment variable provided by Vite.

## Symbols

### `apiHost`
#### Description
This constant stores the base URL of the API, retrieved from the `VITE_API_HOST` environment variable. It is used throughout the application to construct API endpoints.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| apiHost | string | The base URL of the API. |

#### Internal Logic
The code uses `import.meta.env.VITE_API_HOST` to access the value of the environment variable. It then uses type assertion (`as string`) to ensure that the value is treated as a string.

## Dependencies
- Vite: This code relies on Vite's environment variable injection mechanism.

## Configuration
The API host is configured using the `VITE_API_HOST` environment variable. This variable should be set during the Vite build process.
