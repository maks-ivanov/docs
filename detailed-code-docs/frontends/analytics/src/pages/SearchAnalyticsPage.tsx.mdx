## High-level description
The `SearchAnalyticsPage` component displays various charts and data visualizations related to search analytics. It uses a filter bar to allow users to adjust the displayed data based on date range, search method, and search type.

## Table of contents
- Imports
- Component: `SearchAnalyticsPage`

## Code Structure
The `SearchAnalyticsPage` component utilizes several child components to display different aspects of search analytics. The `FilterBar` component manages the filtering of data, while components like `LatencyGraph`, `SearchUsageGraph`, `HeadQueries`, `LowConfidenceQueries`, and `NoResultQueries` fetch and render specific data visualizations. The `ChartCard` component provides a consistent layout for each chart.

## Symbols

### Symbol Name: `SearchAnalyticsPage`
#### Description
This component represents the main view for the search analytics page. It initializes the filter settings and renders the filter bar and a grid of charts.

#### Inputs
This is a React component, so it doesn't have explicit input parameters.

#### Outputs
This component renders the search analytics page content.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Initializes Analytics Filters:**
   - Uses `createStore` to manage the state of analytics filters.
   - Sets default filter values:
     - `date_range`: Starts from 7 days ago.
     - `search_method`:  Undefined (meaning all search methods).
     - `search_type`: Undefined (meaning all search types).
     - `granularity`: Set to "day".

2. **Renders Filter Bar:**
   - Passes the `analyticsFilters` and `setAnalyticsFilters` to the `FilterBar` component.

3. **Renders Charts Grid:**
   - Creates a grid layout to display various charts.
   - Each chart is wrapped in a `ChartCard` component for consistent styling.
   - Passes the relevant `analyticsFilters` to each chart component.
     - `SearchUsageGraph`
     - `LatencyGraph`
     - `HeadQueries`
     - `LowConfidenceQueries`
     - `NoResultQueries`
