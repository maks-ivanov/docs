## High-level description
This directory contains React components for displaying various types of data in table format within an analytics frontend application. The main components are `RAGTablePage` and `SearchTablePage`, which are designed to present Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) data and search query data, respectively.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory implements two main functionalities:

1. RAG Table Page: Currently a placeholder, this page is intended to display RAG-related data in a table format. It's set up as a route in the main application but doesn't have any implemented functionality yet.

2. Search Table Page: This is a fully functional component that fetches search query data from an API and presents it in a table format. It offers the following features:
   - Filtering: Users can apply filters to narrow down the displayed data.
   - Sorting: The table can be sorted by different columns such as "Searched At", "Latency", and "Top Score".
   - Pagination: The data is divided into pages, and users can navigate through these pages.
   - Dynamic rendering: It adapts the displayed columns based on the current filter settings.

## Key Files

1. `RAGTablePage.tsx`:
   - A placeholder component for future implementation of RAG data display.
   - Currently only renders a "Test" text.
   - Set up as a route at "/data/messages" in the main application router.

2. `SearchTablePage.tsx`:
   - The main component for displaying search query data.
   - Implements data fetching, filtering, sorting, and pagination.
   - Uses various UI components like `FilterBar`, `Table`, and `PaginationButtons`.
   - Contains a sub-component `SearchRow` for rendering individual table rows.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. solid-js: Used as the core library for building the user interface.
2. @tanstack/solid-query: Employed for efficient data fetching and caching.
3. date-fns: Utilized for date and time formatting.
4. shared/types and shared/ui: Provide shared type definitions and UI components.
5. Internal modules:
   - api/tables: Contains functions for fetching table data.
   - layouts/TopBarLayout: Provides the layout context.
   - hooks/usePagination: A custom hook for pagination functionality.
   - utils/formatDate: Utility functions for date formatting.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, the `SearchTablePage` component uses context (`DatasetContext`) to access the active dataset, which suggests that the application has some form of dataset configuration.

The filtering, sorting, and pagination settings in `SearchTablePage` are managed through internal state, allowing for dynamic reconfiguration of the table display based on user interactions.

In summary, this directory contains components for displaying analytical data in table format, with a focus on search query data. While the RAG table page is still a placeholder, the search table page offers a rich set of features for data exploration and analysis.
