## High-level description
The `frontends/analytics/src/pages` directory houses the main user interface components for an analytics dashboard. Each file within this directory represents a distinct page or view within the application, focusing on different aspects of data analysis and visualization. These pages include overviews of key metrics, detailed analytics for search and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) functionalities, a trend explorer, and error handling pages.

## What does it do?
This directory provides the visual interfaces for users to interact with various analytical data. Users can:
- **Monitor overall system performance:** View requests per second, head queries, and query counts.
- **Analyze search functionality:** Explore search usage patterns, latency, top queries, low-confidence queries, and queries with no results.
- **Investigate RAG usage:** Filter and visualize RAG queries by date range and type, and examine individual query details.
- **Discover trending search topics:** Identify and analyze rising search terms and associated queries.
- **Handle errors gracefully:** Receive informative messages and guidance in case of missing datasets.

## Entry points
The entry points for each page are the individual `.tsx` files within the directory. Each file represents a self-contained component that can be integrated into the main application router.

## Key Files
### `/errors` subdirectory
This subdirectory contains components for handling specific error scenarios, such as the absence of datasets for a particular organization.

### `CTRAnalyticsPage.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Designed to display click-through rate (CTR) analytics. Currently unused and marked as a placeholder.
- **Functionality:** Renders a simple message indicating its inactive status and includes basic filter setup for future implementation.

### `OverviewPage.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Provides a high-level overview of key system metrics.
- **Functionality:** Displays charts and data visualizations for requests per second, head queries, query counts, and CTR information. Allows time-based filtering for data exploration.

### `RagAnalyticsPage.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Presents detailed analytics specifically for RAG queries.
- **Functionality:** Enables filtering of RAG queries by date range and type, visualizes usage data with a bar graph, and lists individual RAG queries.

### `SearchAnalyticsPage.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Offers comprehensive insights into search functionality and performance.
- **Functionality:** Presents various charts and visualizations related to search analytics, including latency, usage patterns, top queries, low-confidence queries, and queries with no results. Allows filtering by date range, search method, and search type.

### `TrendExplorer.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Enables the discovery and analysis of trending search topics.
- **Functionality:** Displays a table of trending topics within a selected dataset. Users can drill down into each topic to view associated search queries and their details.

### `/tablePages` subdirectory
This subdirectory contains components for displaying data in a tabular format, focusing on RAG and search query data.

## Dependencies
The codebase within the `pages` directory relies on various external libraries and internal modules for state management, data fetching, UI components, date manipulation, and more. Some key dependencies include:

- **date-fns:** Used for date and time operations, such as calculating date ranges and formatting.
- **solid-js/store:** Provides state management capabilities for components.
- **@tanstack/solid-query:** Enables efficient data fetching and caching.
- **shared/types:** Defines common data types used across the application.
- **shared/ui:** Offers reusable UI components like buttons, modals, and tables.
- **Internal modules:** Various internal modules provide specific functionalities like API interactions, layout contexts, custom hooks, and utility functions.
