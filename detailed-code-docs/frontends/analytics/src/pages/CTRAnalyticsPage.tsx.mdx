title: "CTRAnalyticsPage.tsx"
---

## High-level description
This code defines the `CTRAnalyticsPage` and `SearchCTRAnalytics` components for a page that is supposed to display click-through rate (CTR) analytics. However, the page is currently unused and marked as such in the code.

## Table of contents
- `CTRAnalyticsPage` component
- `SearchCTRAnalytics` component

## Code Structure
The `CTRAnalyticsPage` component renders the `SearchCTRAnalytics` component. The `SearchCTRAnalytics` component manages the filter state for the analytics and renders a `FilterBar` component.

## References
- `AnalyticsParams` type from "shared/types"
- `FilterBar` component from "../components/FilterBar"

## Symbols

### Symbol Name
#### `CTRAnalyticsPage`
#### Description
A functional component that renders a simple div containing the text "Search" and the `SearchCTRAnalytics` component.
#### Inputs
None
#### Outputs
JSX representing the CTR Analytics page.

### Symbol Name
#### `SearchCTRAnalytics`
#### Description
A functional component that renders a `FilterBar` component and a placeholder message indicating the page is unused. It also initializes the state for the search CTR filter using the `createStore` hook from SolidJS.
#### Inputs
None
#### Outputs
JSX representing the search CTR analytics section.
#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes a state variable `searchCtrFilter` using `createStore` with an initial value of type `AnalyticsParams`.
    - The initial filter includes a date range filter for the past 7 days, a search method of "hybrid", and a search type of "search".
    - The `granularity` is set to "minute" but is not currently used.
2. Renders a `FilterBar` component, passing the `searchCtrFilter` state and its setter function as props.
3. Displays the text "Unused page!!!"

## Side Effects
- The `setSearchCtrFilter` function, when called, updates the state of the search CTR filter, which will cause the `FilterBar` component to re-render.

## Dependencies
- date-fns: Used for date manipulation (`subDays`).
- solid-js/store: Used for state management (`createStore`).
- shared/types: Provides the `AnalyticsParams` type.
- ../components/FilterBar: Provides the `FilterBar` component.

## Future Improvements
- Implement the actual CTR analytics display and functionality.
- Remove the "Unused page!!!" message once the page is implemented.
- Consider using the `granularity` property in the analytics display.
- Add error handling and loading states to improve the user experience.
