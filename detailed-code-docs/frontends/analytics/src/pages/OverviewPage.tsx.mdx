## High-level description
The `OverviewPage` component renders the main overview page of the analytics dashboard, displaying key metrics and charts related to search usage and performance. It utilizes various sub-components to present data on requests per second, head queries, query counts, and click-through rate (CTR).

## Table of contents
- `OverviewPage` component

## Code Structure
The `OverviewPage` component utilizes several functional components from other modules to compose the layout and functionality of the overview page. It uses `ChartCard` to encapsulate individual charts and their controls, `SimpleTimeRangeSelector` and `useSimpleTimeRange` for time-based filtering, and components like `QueryCounts`, `SearchUsageGraph`, and `HeadQueries` to render specific data visualizations.

## Symbols
### Symbol Name
`OverviewPage`

#### Description
This functional component renders the main content of the analytics overview page. It fetches and displays data related to search usage, including requests per second, head queries, and query counts. The page also includes a CTR information panel and allows users to filter data based on time ranges.

#### Inputs
This component does not take any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This component renders the JSX structure of the overview page.

#### Internal Logic
1. **State Management:** Utilizes the `useSimpleTimeRange` hook to manage the selected time range for different charts.
2. **Layout:** Structures the page using a grid layout to arrange the charts and information panel.
3. **Component Composition:** Renders various sub-components:
    - `CTRInfoPanel`: Displays information about click-through rate setup.
    - `ChartCard`: Encapsulates individual charts, providing titles, controls, and styling.
    - `QueryCounts`: Displays the total count of queries by type.
    - `SearchUsageGraph`: Visualizes requests per second over time.
    - `HeadQueries`: Shows the most frequent search queries.
    - `SimpleTimeRangeSelector`: Allows users to select a time range for filtering data.
