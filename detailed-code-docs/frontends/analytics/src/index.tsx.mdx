## High-level description
This code defines the main entry point for the Analytics frontend application. It sets up routing, context providers for user authentication and data fetching, and renders the appropriate page components based on the current route.

## Table of contents
- Imports
- `queryClient`
- `routes`
- Rendering

## Code Structure
The code is structured as a single-file application entry point. It defines the main application routes, sets up context providers, and renders the application using SolidJS's `render` function. The `routes` array defines the application's routing structure, mapping paths to specific components.

## Symbols
### `queryClient`
#### Description
This variable initializes a new instance of `QueryClient` from the `@tanstack/solid-query` library. This client is responsible for managing cached data and handling data fetching, caching, and updates for the application.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a new `QueryClient` object.

### `routes`
#### Description
This variable defines the application's routing structure. It is an array of `RouteDefinition` objects from the `@solidjs/router` library. Each `RouteDefinition` maps a specific path to a corresponding component, allowing the application to render different pages based on the current URL.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Defines an array of route definitions.
- Each route definition includes:
    - `path`: The URL path that triggers this route.
    - `component`: The SolidJS component to render when the route is active.
    - `children`: (Optional) An array of nested route definitions for handling sub-routes.
