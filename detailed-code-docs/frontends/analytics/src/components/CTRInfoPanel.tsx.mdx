## High-level description
The `CTRInfoPanel` component displays an informational panel if click-through rate (CTR) analytics have not been set up for the current dataset. It instructs the user on how to enable CTR tracking.

## Table of contents
- `CTRInfoPanel`

## Symbols

### Symbol Name: `CTRInfoPanel`
#### Description
This component renders a styled `div` element containing a message informing the user that CTR analytics are not yet set up for the dataset. It provides a link to the Analytics API reference for instructions on sending CTR data. The panel is only displayed if the `useCTRNeedsSetup` hook returns `true`.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
This component renders a conditional `div` element to the DOM.

#### Internal Logic
1. It calls the `useCTRNeedsSetup` hook to determine if CTR setup is required.
2. It uses a `Show` component from SolidJS to conditionally render the info panel based on the value returned by `useCTRNeedsSetup`.

## Side Effects
This component has no direct side effects. It simply renders UI elements based on the state provided by the `useCTRNeedsSetup` hook.

## References
- `useCTRNeedsSetup`: A custom hook that checks if CTR data is available for the dataset.

## Dependencies
- `solid-js`: Used for the `Show` component.

## Future Improvements
- The component could be more reusable by accepting the message and link target as props. This would allow it to be used for other informational panels with similar styling.
- The styling could be extracted to a separate CSS class for better maintainability.
