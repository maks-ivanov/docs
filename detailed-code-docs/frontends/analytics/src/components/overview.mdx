## High-level description
The `frontends/analytics/src/components` directory houses a collection of reusable UI components for the Trieve Analytics application. These components range from simple UI elements like pagination buttons to more complex data visualization tools like charts and filter controls. They are designed to be modular and composable, allowing developers to build rich and interactive analytics dashboards.

## What does it do?
This directory provides the building blocks for the user interface of the Trieve Analytics application. It enables users to:

- **Filter and visualize analytics data:** Components like `FilterBar`, `SimpleTimeRangeSelector`, and various chart components allow users to refine and explore analytics data based on different criteria like date ranges, search methods, and query types.
- **Navigate through data:** The `PaginationButtons` component enables users to browse large datasets across multiple pages.
- **Interact with the application:** The `Sidebar` component provides navigation and access to different sections of the application, while components like `CTRInfoPanel` offer guidance and instructions to users.

These components work together to create a user-friendly and informative analytics dashboard, empowering users to understand and analyze search and RAG-related metrics.

## Entry points
While there are many individual components in this directory, the main entry points for understanding the UI structure are:

- `Sidebar.tsx`: Defines the main sidebar navigation of the application.
- `FilterBar.tsx`: Provides the primary filter controls for the analytics dashboard.
- The `charts` subdirectory: Contains various chart components that visualize different aspects of the analytics data.

## Key Files
- `PaginationButtons.tsx`: Renders pagination controls for navigating large datasets.
- `SimpleTimeRangeSelector.tsx`: Offers a simplified way to select common time ranges for filtering data.
- `CTRInfoPanel.tsx`: Displays an informational panel if click-through rate tracking is not set up.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and frameworks:

- **SolidJS:** The core library for building the user interface and managing component state.
- **@solidjs/router:** Used for handling navigation between different views within the application.
- **shared/ui:** A custom library providing shared UI components like `Select` and `DateRangePicker`.
- **date-fns:** Provides utilities for working with dates and times.
- **solid-icons/:** Offers a collection of icons used throughout the application.
- **@tanstack/solid-query:** (Used in the `charts` subdirectory) Manages data fetching, caching, and state updates for chart components.
- **Chart.js:** (Used in the `charts` subdirectory) Provides the charting library for rendering various types of data visualizations.
