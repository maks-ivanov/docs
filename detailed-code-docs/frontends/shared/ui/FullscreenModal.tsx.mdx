## Symbols

### Symbol Name
`FullScreenModal`

#### Description
This component renders a full-screen modal dialog using the `terracotta` UI library. It leverages the `Portal` component from `solid-js/web` to render the modal outside the regular DOM hierarchy, ensuring it overlays other elements. The modal's visibility is controlled by the `show` prop, and it includes smooth transitions for opening and closing.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | JSX.Element | The content to be displayed within the modal. |
| show | Accessor\&lt;boolean&gt; | An accessor function that returns a boolean indicating whether the modal should be visible. |
| title | string (optional) | The title to be displayed in the modal's header. |
| setShow | (show: boolean) =&gt; void | A function to update the visibility state of the modal. |
| icon | JSX.Element (optional) | An optional icon to be displayed next to the title in the modal's header. |

#### Outputs
This component does not have any explicit outputs.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Portal Rendering:** The modal is rendered within a `Portal` component, ensuring it appears on top of other content.
2. **Visibility Control:** The `show` prop determines the modal's visibility.
3. **Transition Effects:** The `Transition` component from `terracotta` provides smooth transitions for opening and closing the modal.
4. **Overlay and Panel:** The modal consists of a semi-transparent overlay (`DialogOverlay`) and a content panel (`DialogPanel`).
5. **Title and Icon:** The modal's header can display a title and an optional icon.
6. **Content Area:** The `children` prop is rendered within the `DialogPanel`, allowing for flexible content within the modal.

## Side Effects
