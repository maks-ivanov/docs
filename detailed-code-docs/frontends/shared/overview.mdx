## High-level description
The `frontends/shared` directory houses shared code for the frontends of the Trieve application. This includes UI components, utility functions, TypeScript types, and ESLint configuration. This structure promotes code reuse and consistency across different parts of the application's frontend.

## What does it do?
This directory provides reusable components and logic that can be used across different frontends of the Trieve application. This includes:

- **UI components:** like a date range picker, modal dialogs, a JSON input component, and a customizable table, all built using SolidJS and styled with Tailwind CSS.
- **Utility functions:** for tasks like merging CSS classes and managing dates.
- **TypeScript types:** defining data structures used across different frontends, ensuring type safety and consistency.
- **ESLint configuration:** ensuring consistent code style and quality across the frontends.

## Entry points
- `frontends/shared/index.ts`: Exports the shared UI components, making them accessible to other parts of the application.
- `frontends/shared/types.ts`: Defines TypeScript types used across different frontends.
- `frontends/shared/utils/index.ts`: Exports utility functions like the `cn` function for merging CSS classes.

## Key Files
### `frontends/shared/.eslintrc.json`
This file defines the ESLint configuration for the shared frontend code. It sets up the environment, extends recommended rules, configures the parser, and customizes some rules for the project.

### `frontends/shared/package.json`
This file manages the dependencies for the shared frontend code, including libraries like SolidJS, Terracotta UI, and Tailwind CSS.

### `frontends/shared/tsconfig.json`
This file configures the TypeScript compiler for the shared frontend code, specifying compiler options and including necessary source files.

### `frontends/shared/types.ts`
This file defines various TypeScript interfaces and enums used across different frontends of the Trieve application. These types represent data structures for users, organizations, datasets, API keys, and more.

### `frontends/shared/ui`
This directory contains reusable UI components for the frontend, including a date range picker, a full-screen modal, a JSON input component, a select box, a table, and a tooltip.

### `frontends/shared/utils`
This directory contains utility functions, including a function for merging Tailwind CSS classes using `clsx` and `tailwind-merge`.

## Dependencies
The `frontends/shared` directory depends on various external libraries and frameworks, including:

- **SolidJS:** for building reactive user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS:** for styling components.
- **Terracotta UI:** for providing additional UI components.
- **@rnwonder/solid-date-picker:** for a date picker component.
- **JSONEditor:** for a JSON input component.
- **@nozbe/microfuzz:** for fuzzy search functionality.
- **cva:** for defining and applying Tailwind CSS classes.
- **date-fns:** for date manipulation.
- **clsx:** for conditionally joining CSS classes.
- **tailwind-merge:** for merging Tailwind CSS classes.
