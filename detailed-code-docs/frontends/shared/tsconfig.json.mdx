## High-level description
This file is a TypeScript configuration file (tsconfig.json) for the shared frontend components. It extends a base configuration and specifies compiler options and source file inclusions for the TypeScript compiler.

## Table of contents
- Base configuration extension
- Compiler options
- Included source files

## Code Structure
The configuration is structured as a JSON object with three main properties: "extends", "compilerOptions", and "include".

## Symbols

### extends
#### Description

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| config/tsconfig | Base TypeScript configuration file |

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding more specific compiler options if needed for the shared frontend components.
- Evaluate if the `noUnusedLocals` option should be set to `true` to enforce better code quality.
- Review the included directories and files to ensure all necessary sources are covered.
