## High-level description

The `openapi/src` directory is part of a TypeScript project that focuses on defining and interacting with an API. It contains auto-generated TypeScript files that map out the API's structure using interfaces and types, ensuring type safety and consistency when interacting with the API. The directory also includes functionality to create a client for making API requests using the `openapi-fetch` library.

## What does it do?

The `openapi/src` directory serves two primary purposes:

1. **API Structure Definition**: The `api.ts` file provides a detailed mapping of the API's endpoints, request and response structures, and associated data schemas. This is achieved through TypeScript interfaces and types, which are auto-generated from an OpenAPI specification. This setup ensures that developers have a clear and type-safe way to interact with the API, reducing the likelihood of errors when making requests or handling responses.

2. **API Client Creation**: The `index.ts` file defines a function to create a client for interacting with the API. This client is configured using the `openapi-fetch` library, which simplifies the process of making HTTP requests to the API. The client is tailored to the API paths defined in the `api.ts` file, ensuring that all interactions with the API are consistent with its defined structure.

## Entry points

The main files in the `openapi/src` directory are:

- **`api.ts`**: This file is the cornerstone for defining the API's structure. It includes interfaces for API endpoints, request parameters, and response types, all derived from an OpenAPI specification. This file is crucial for ensuring that any interaction with the API is type-safe and consistent with its defined structure.

- **`index.ts`**: This file provides the functionality to create a client for interacting with the API. It exports the `createMarimoClient` function, which uses the `openapi-fetch` library to generate a client configured with the API paths defined in `api.ts`. This client is essential for making requests to the API in a structured and reliable manner.

## Dependencies

The `openapi/src` directory relies on the following external library:

- **`openapi-fetch`**: This library is used to create a client for making API requests. It simplifies the process of configuring and executing HTTP requests to the API, ensuring that the client adheres to the API paths and types defined in the `api.ts` file. This library is chosen for its ability to integrate seamlessly with OpenAPI specifications, providing a robust solution for API interactions.
