## High-level description
The target file is responsible for exporting types from an API module and defining a function to create a client for interacting with an API. It utilizes the `openapi-fetch` library to create a client that is configured with specific options.

## Code Structure
The main symbols in the code are interconnected as follows:
- The `createMarimoClient` function is the primary export of this module, which uses the `createClient` function from the `openapi-fetch` library.
- The `paths` type, imported from the `./api` module, is used as a generic parameter to specify the API paths for the client.

## References
- `createClient` and `ClientOptions` are imported from the `openapi-fetch` library.
- `paths` is imported from the `./api` module, which is expected to define the API paths.

## Symbols

### `createMarimoClient`
#### Description
The `createMarimoClient` function is designed to create and return a client instance configured to interact with a specific API. It leverages the `openapi-fetch` library to generate a client that adheres to the API paths defined in the `paths` type.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| opts | ClientOptions | Configuration options for the client, such as base URL, headers, etc. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| client | ReturnType of `createClient&lt;paths&gt;` | A client instance configured to interact with the specified API paths. |

#### Internal Logic
The function simply calls `createClient` with the provided options and the `paths` type, which defines the structure of the API. This setup ensures that the client is correctly configured to make requests to the API endpoints defined in `paths`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `openapi-fetch` | Used to create a client for making API requests. |

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on the `openapi-fetch` library to handle any errors that may occur during client creation or API interaction.

## Logging
The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The code does not explicitly define an API or public interface beyond the `createMarimoClient` function.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
