## High-level description

The `openapi/api.yaml` file defines the OpenAPI specification for the Marimo API, which is a comprehensive API for managing and interacting with a notebook-like application. This specification includes definitions for various API endpoints, request and response schemas, and data models used throughout the application. The API supports operations such as file management, code execution, AI completion, and more.

## Code Structure

The file is structured into several main sections:
- **Components**: Defines reusable schemas for request and response bodies, parameters, and other data structures.
- **Paths**: Specifies the API endpoints, including HTTP methods, request parameters, request bodies, and response formats.
- **Info**: Provides metadata about the API, such as its title and version.

### Components
#### Description
The `components` section defines various schemas that are used throughout the API. These schemas represent the data structures for requests and responses, such as `AiCompletionRequest`, `Alert`, `AppMetadata`, and many others.

#### Internal Logic
Each schema is defined with properties, types, and constraints (e.g., required fields, enumerations). These schemas are referenced in the `paths` section to define the structure of API requests and responses.

### Paths
#### Description
The `paths` section defines the available API endpoints, including the HTTP methods supported, the expected request parameters and bodies, and the response formats. Each endpoint is associated with a specific operation, such as creating a file, executing code, or retrieving application status.

#### Internal Logic
Each path entry specifies:
- The HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST).
- Parameters required for the request, such as path or query parameters.
- The request body schema, if applicable.
- The possible responses, including status codes and response body schemas.

## References

The file references various schemas defined in the `components` section to specify the structure of requests and responses for each API endpoint.

## Dependencies

The OpenAPI specification does not directly list external dependencies, but it is designed to be used with tools that support OpenAPI, such as Swagger or Postman, for API documentation and testing.

## Error Handling

The specification includes error responses for various endpoints, typically using HTTP status codes like 400 for bad requests or 404 for not found errors. Each error response is associated with a description to provide context.

## API/Interface Reference

The file defines a comprehensive set of API endpoints, each with detailed specifications for requests and responses. Here are a few examples:

| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| `/api/ai/completion` | POST | `AiCompletionRequest` | JSON object | Get AI completion for a prompt |
| `/api/files/create` | POST | `FileCreateRequest` | `FileCreateResponse` | Create a new file or directory |
| `/api/kernel/run` | POST | `RunRequest` | `SuccessResponse` | Run a cell and update its code in the kernel |

## TODOs

There are no explicit TODOs in the file, but the specification may need updates as the API evolves or new features are added.
