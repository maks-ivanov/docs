## High-level description

The `openapi` directory is a crucial part of the Marimo API project, which is designed to manage and interact with a notebook-like application. This directory contains the OpenAPI specification, TypeScript configuration, and scripts necessary for defining and interacting with the API. The main components include the OpenAPI specification file (`api.yaml`), TypeScript source files (`src`), and configuration files (`package.json` and `tsconfig.json`). These components work together to provide a structured and type-safe way to interact with the API, ensuring consistency and reducing errors in API requests and responses.

## What does it do?

The `openapi` directory serves several key functions:

1. **API Specification**: The `api.yaml` file defines the OpenAPI specification for the Marimo API. This specification outlines the available API endpoints, request and response schemas, and data models. It provides a comprehensive blueprint for how the API should be used, including operations like file management, code execution, and AI completion.

2. **TypeScript Integration**: The `src` directory contains TypeScript files that map out the API's structure using interfaces and types. These files are auto-generated from the OpenAPI specification, ensuring that developers have a clear and type-safe way to interact with the API. The `index.ts` file in this directory provides functionality to create a client for making API requests using the `openapi-fetch` library.

3. **Package Configuration**: The `package.json` file defines the package's metadata, dependencies, and scripts. It includes a script for generating TypeScript types from the OpenAPI specification, ensuring that the TypeScript files are always in sync with the API definition.

4. **TypeScript Compilation**: The `tsconfig.json` file specifies the TypeScript compiler options, defining how the TypeScript code should be compiled into JavaScript. This includes settings for the module system, module resolution strategy, and type-checking options.

## Entry points

The main files in the `openapi` directory are:

- **`api.yaml`**: This file is the cornerstone of the API specification, defining the endpoints, request and response schemas, and data models. It is essential for understanding the structure and functionality of the Marimo API.

- **`src/api.ts`**: This file provides a detailed mapping of the API's endpoints, request and response structures, and associated data schemas using TypeScript interfaces and types. It is crucial for ensuring type-safe interactions with the API.

- **`src/index.ts`**: This file defines the `createMarimoClient` function, which uses the `openapi-fetch` library to generate a client for making API requests. It is essential for executing API requests in a structured and reliable manner.

## Key Files

- **`package.json`**: This configuration file defines the package's metadata, dependencies, and scripts. It includes a script for generating TypeScript types from the OpenAPI specification, ensuring that the TypeScript files are always in sync with the API definition.

- **`tsconfig.json`**: This file specifies the TypeScript compiler options, defining how the TypeScript code should be compiled into JavaScript. It includes settings for the module system, module resolution strategy, and type-checking options.

## Dependencies

The `openapi` directory relies on several external libraries:

- **`openapi-fetch`**: Used for making HTTP requests to OpenAPI endpoints. It simplifies the process of configuring and executing requests, ensuring adherence to the API paths and types defined in the `api.ts` file.

- **`openapi-typescript`**: A development dependency for generating TypeScript types from OpenAPI specifications. It ensures that the TypeScript files are always in sync with the API definition.

- **`typescript`**: Provides TypeScript support for the project, enabling type-safe interactions with the API.

## Configuration

- **`package.json`**: Specifies the module type for the package, indicating it uses ES modules. It also includes a script for generating TypeScript types from the OpenAPI specification.

- **`tsconfig.json`**: Defines the TypeScript compiler options, including the module system (`ESNext`), module resolution strategy (`Bundler`), and type-checking options (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`). These settings ensure that the TypeScript code is compiled correctly and adheres to modern JavaScript standards.
