title: "tsconfig.json"
---

## High-level description
The `tsconfig.json` file is a configuration file for the TypeScript compiler, which specifies the compiler options for a TypeScript project. This file is used to define how the TypeScript code should be compiled into JavaScript, including module system, module resolution strategy, and type-checking options.

## Code Structure
The `tsconfig.json` file contains a single JSON object with a key `compilerOptions`, which holds various configuration settings for the TypeScript compiler.

## Symbols

### `compilerOptions`
#### Description
The `compilerOptions` object specifies the settings that control the behavior of the TypeScript compiler. It includes options for module system, module resolution, and type-checking.

#### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| module | string | - | Specifies the module code generation method. In this case, it is set to `ESNext`, which uses the latest ECMAScript module syntax. |
| moduleResolution | string | - | Determines how modules are resolved. The `Bundler` option is used here, which is suitable for modern bundlers that support ES module resolution. |
| noUncheckedIndexedAccess | boolean | false | When set to `true`, this option adds `undefined` to the type of an element accessed using an index signature, which helps catch potential runtime errors by ensuring stricter type-checking. |

## Dependencies
There are no external libraries or modules directly referenced in this configuration file. However, it is implied that the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) is used to interpret these settings.

## Error Handling
The `tsconfig.json` file itself does not handle errors, but incorrect configurations can lead to compilation errors when the TypeScript compiler is run.

## Logging
There is no logging mechanism implemented in this configuration file.

## API/Interface Reference
This file does not define an API or public interface. It is purely a configuration file for the TypeScript compiler.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
