## High-level description
This code defines a simple file system interface in Go. It provides a default implementation of the `fs.FS` interface from the standard library, which allows for opening files using the operating system's default file operations.

## Code Structure
The code defines a package-level variable `FS` of type `fs.FS`, which is initialized with an instance of `defaultFS`. The `defaultFS` struct implements the `Open` method required by the `fs.FS` interface.

## Symbols

### `FS`
#### Description
`FS` is a package-level variable of type `fs.FS`. It provides a file system interface that can be used throughout the package for file operations.

#### Inputs
N/A (It's a variable, not a function)

#### Outputs
N/A (It's a variable, not a function)

___

### `defaultFS`
#### Description
`defaultFS` is a struct that implements the `fs.FS` interface. It provides a default implementation for file system operations.

#### Inputs
N/A (It's a struct, not a function)

#### Outputs
N/A (It's a struct, not a function)

___

### `defaultFS.Open`
#### Description
`Open` is a method of the `defaultFS` struct that implements the `Open` method required by the `fs.FS` interface. It opens the named file using the operating system's default file operations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | The name of the file to open |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| file | fs.File | The opened file |
| error | error | An error, if any occurred during the operation |

#### Internal Logic
The method simply calls `os.Open(name)` and returns its results. This means it uses the operating system's default file opening mechanism.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| io/fs | Provides the `fs.FS` and `fs.File` interfaces |
| os | Used for opening files with the operating system's default mechanism |

## Notes
1. This implementation provides a thin wrapper around the operating system's file operations, allowing for easy file access within the package.
2. The use of `fs.FS` interface allows for potential future extensions or replacements of the file system implementation without changing the code that uses it.
3. The package-level `FS` variable can be reassigned if needed, allowing for easy testing or alternative implementations in different contexts.
