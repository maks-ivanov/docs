## High-level description
This Go package provides helper functions for executing GPTScript in integration tests. It includes functions to run the GPTScript executable and execute scripts with various options, accommodating different operating systems.

## Symbols

### `GPTScriptExec`
#### Description
This function executes the GPTScript binary with the provided arguments, handling platform-specific differences for Windows.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| args | ...string | Variable number of string arguments to pass to the GPTScript executable |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | string | The combined stdout and stderr output of the executed command |
| err | error | Any error that occurred during execution |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an `exec.Command` with the path to the GPTScript binary and the provided arguments.
2. Checks if the operating system is Windows and adjusts the command path accordingly.
3. Executes the command and captures the combined output.
4. Returns the output as a string and any error that occurred.

### `RunScript`
#### Description
This function is a wrapper around `GPTScriptExec` that simplifies running a GPTScript with additional options.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| script | string | The script to be executed |
| options | ...string | Optional additional arguments to pass to the GPTScript executable |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | string | The combined stdout and stderr output of the executed script |
| err | error | Any error that occurred during execution |

#### Internal Logic
1. Appends the `--quiet` flag and the script to the provided options.
2. Calls `GPTScriptExec` with the combined arguments.
3. Returns the output and error from `GPTScriptExec`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| os/exec | For executing external commands |
| runtime | For determining the operating system |

## Performance Considerations
The `GPTScriptExec` function uses `CombinedOutput()`, which waits for the command to complete and returns all output at once. For large outputs or long-running scripts, this might consume significant memory. Consider using streaming output methods for such cases if they become problematic.
