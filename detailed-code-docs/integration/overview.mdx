## High-level description
This directory contains integration tests and helper functions for GPTScript, focusing on credential-related functionality and script execution. It includes tests for credential scopes, expiration times, and the execution of credential-related scripts, as well as helper functions to run GPTScript in different environments.

## What does it do?
The integration directory provides a suite of tests and utilities to ensure that GPTScript's credential management and script execution work correctly across different scenarios. It tests:

1. Execution of credential-related scripts
2. Proper scoping of credentials within different sub-tools
3. Correct handling of credential expiration times

Additionally, it offers helper functions that abstract the process of running GPTScript executables, making it easier to write and maintain integration tests across different operating systems.

## Key Files

1. cred_test.go
   - Contains integration tests for credential functionality
   - Tests credential scopes, expiration times, and script execution
   - Utilizes external scripts to verify credential behavior

2. helpers.go
   - Provides utility functions for executing GPTScript in tests
   - Handles platform-specific differences (e.g., Windows vs. Unix-like systems)
   - Offers a simplified interface for running scripts with various options

## Dependencies
The integration tests rely on the following external libraries:

1. github.com/stretchr/testify/require (version not specified)
   - Used for test assertions and error handling
   - Chosen for its comprehensive set of assertion functions and clear error messages

Standard library dependencies include:
- strings: For string manipulation and parsing
- testing: Provides the testing infrastructure
- time: Used for time-related operations
- os/exec: For executing external commands
- runtime: For determining the operating system

## Configuration
The integration tests use external scripts located in a "scripts" directory:
- scripts/cred_scopes.gpt: Used for testing credential scopes
- scripts/cred_expiration.gpt: Used for testing credential expiration

These scripts are not included in the provided files but are crucial for the tests to function correctly.

The `GPTScriptExec` function in helpers.go assumes a specific location for the GPTScript binary:
- On non-Windows systems: "../gptscript"
- On Windows systems: "../gptscript.exe"

Ensure that the GPTScript binary is located in the correct path relative to the integration tests for proper execution.

## Code Examples

Here's an example of how the `RunScript` function from helpers.go is used in the integration tests:

```go
output, err := RunScript("scripts/cred_scopes.gpt", "oneOne")
require.NoError(t, err)
require.Contains(t, output, "good")
```

This code runs the "cred_scopes.gpt" script with the "oneOne" argument and checks that the output contains the string "good" and that no error occurred.

The `TestCredentialExpirationEnv` function in cred_test.go demonstrates how to parse and verify the expiration time of credentials:

```go
func TestCredentialExpirationEnv(t *testing.T) {
    output, err := RunScript("scripts/cred_expiration.gpt")
    require.NoError(t, err)
    lines := strings.Split(output, "\n")
    for _, line := range lines {
        if strings.HasPrefix(line, "EXPIRATION:") {
            parts := strings.Split(line, ":")
            require.Len(t, parts, 2)
            expiration, err := time.Parse(time.RFC3339, strings.TrimSpace(parts[1]))
            require.NoError(t, err)
            require.Less(t, time.Until(expiration), 1*time.Hour)
            return
        }
    }
    require.Fail(t, "Did not find EXPIRATION: in output")
}
```

This test runs a script that outputs credential expiration information, parses the output to extract the expiration timestamp, and verifies that it's less than one hour in the future.

These integration tests and helper functions play a crucial role in ensuring the reliability and correctness of GPTScript's credential management and script execution capabilities across different environments and use cases.
