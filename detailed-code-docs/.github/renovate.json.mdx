title: "renovate.json"
---

## High-level description
The `renovate.json` file is a configuration file for Renovate Bot, a tool used to automate dependency updates in software projects. This configuration specifies how Renovate should handle updates for different types of dependencies, including scheduling, grouping, and specific rules for certain packages.

## Code Structure
The configuration is structured as a JSON object with various properties that define the behavior of Renovate Bot. These properties include global settings, language-specific configurations, and detailed package rules that dictate how different types of dependencies should be managed.

## Symbols

### `$schema`
#### Description
Specifies the JSON schema URL for validation of the configuration file.

### `extends`
#### Description
Defines base configurations and schedules that this configuration extends. In this case, it extends the "config:base" and "schedule:monthly" presets.

### `labels`
#### Description
Specifies labels to be applied to pull requests created by Renovate. Here, the label "dependencies" is used.

### `pin`
#### Description
A boolean setting that determines whether dependencies should be pinned to specific versions. It is set to `false`, meaning dependencies will not be pinned.

### `rangeStrategy`
#### Description
Defines the strategy for updating version ranges. The "bump" strategy is used, which updates the version to the latest within the specified range.

### `postUpdateOptions`
#### Description
Specifies actions to perform after updates. The "pnpmDedupe" option is used to deduplicate dependencies when using pnpm.

### `python`
#### Description
Configures Renovate for Python dependencies, enabling updates for packages matching the patterns ".*sphinx.*" and ".*ruff.*".

### `pre-commit`
#### Description
Enables Renovate to manage dependencies for pre-commit hooks.

### `pep621`
#### Description
Enables support for PEP 621, which is a specification for Python project metadata.

### `packageRules`
#### Description
An array of rules that define specific behaviors for different types of dependencies.

#### Internal Logic
- **Rule 1**: Disables updates for "peerDependencies" and "project.dependencies".
- **Rule 2**: Groups pre-commit dependencies for weekly updates.
- **Rule 3**: Disables updates for the "node" package.
- **Rule 4**: Groups all non-major dependencies, excluding certain patterns and names, for minor and patch updates.
- **Rule 5**: Groups all "radix" dependencies for patch updates.
- **Rule 6**: Groups all "storybook" dependencies for all update types (minor, patch, major).
- **Rule 7**: Groups all "eslint" dependencies for all update types (minor, patch, major).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Renovate Bot | Automates dependency updates based on the configuration provided. |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| `$schema` | string | N/A | URL for JSON schema validation. |
| `extends` | array | N/A | Base configurations and schedules to extend. |
| `labels` | array | N/A | Labels for pull requests. |
| `pin` | boolean | false | Whether to pin dependencies to specific versions. |
| `rangeStrategy` | string | "bump" | Strategy for updating version ranges. |
| `postUpdateOptions` | array | N/A | Actions to perform after updates. |
| `python` | object | N/A | Configuration for Python dependencies. |
| `pre-commit` | object | N/A | Configuration for pre-commit dependencies. |
| `pep621` | object | N/A | Configuration for PEP 621 support. |
| `packageRules` | array | N/A | Specific rules for managing dependencies. |

## Error Handling
The configuration does not explicitly handle errors, as it is a declarative JSON file. Error handling is managed by Renovate Bot based on the validity and correctness of the configuration.

## Logging
Renovate Bot typically handles logging internally, providing logs for actions taken based on this configuration, such as updates applied or skipped.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
