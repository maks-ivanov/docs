## High-level description

The `.github` directory is a crucial part of the "marimo" project, containing configurations and templates that streamline project management and automation on GitHub. It includes issue and pull request templates, Renovate Bot configuration for dependency management, and GitHub Actions workflows for automating development processes. The main components are:

- **Issue Templates**: YAML files for structured issue reporting.
- **Pull Request Template**: A markdown file guiding contributors on how to submit pull requests.
- **Renovate Configuration**: A JSON file for automating dependency updates.
- **Workflows**: YAML files for automating tasks like testing, releasing, and compliance checks.

## What does it do?

The `.github` directory enhances the efficiency and consistency of project management by providing structured templates and automation scripts:

1. **Issue and Pull Request Management**: 
   - **Issue Templates**: Facilitate structured reporting of bugs, feature requests, and documentation suggestions, ensuring that all necessary information is provided for efficient resolution.
   - **Pull Request Template**: Guides contributors in submitting pull requests, ensuring they follow project guidelines and include necessary information for review.

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - **Renovate Bot**: Automates the process of updating project dependencies, reducing manual effort and ensuring that the project uses the latest stable versions of libraries and tools.

3. **Automated Workflows**:
   - **CLA Compliance**: Ensures legal compliance by checking if contributors have signed the Contributor License Agreement.
   - **Release Automation**: Automates the process of publishing development and production releases, including notifications to Discord.
   - **Testing**: Runs automated tests for both frontend and backend components, ensuring code quality and functionality across different environments.
   - **CLI Testing**: Specifically tests the command-line interface of the project, ensuring it works correctly across various operating systems.

These components work together to streamline project management, reduce manual workload, and maintain high standards of code quality and legal compliance.
