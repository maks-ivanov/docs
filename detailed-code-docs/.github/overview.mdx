## High-level description
This `.github` directory contains GitHub-specific configuration files and workflows for a software project, likely related to search, analytics, and chat functionality. It includes issue templates, pull request templates, custom linting rules for API specifications, and various GitHub Actions workflows that automate tasks such as building and pushing Docker images, running tests, linting code, and generating documentation.

## What does it do?
This directory serves several important functions in the development process:

1. Standardizes issue reporting: The issue template ensures that all bug reports and feature requests follow a consistent format, making it easier for developers to understand and address them.

2. Streamlines pull requests: The pull request template guides contributors to provide necessary information about their changes, linking them to relevant issues and notifying maintainers.

3. Enforces API specification standards: The custom linting rules help maintain consistency in the API documentation by disabling certain default rules that may not fit the project's needs.

4. Automates development workflows: The GitHub Actions workflows automate various tasks such as:
   - Building and pushing Docker images for different components (frontend, server, ClickHouse, etc.)
   - Running tests for different features (analytics, chat, search, etc.)
   - Linting code to ensure code quality
   - Generating and validating API documentation
   - Performing Rust-specific checks and tests

These automated processes help maintain code quality, ensure consistent builds, and streamline the deployment process across different components of the application.

## Key Files
1. `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/issue_template.md`: Provides a standardized format for reporting issues, including description, targets, requirements to close, and community channels for support.

2. `.github/pull_request_template.md`: Offers a simple template for pull requests, prompting contributors to link their changes to relevant issues and tag maintainers.

3. `.github/rules.yaml`: Configures custom linting rules for API specifications, specifically disabling the `paths-kebab-case` rule from the recommended Spectral OAS ruleset.

4. `.github/workflows/`: Contains multiple YAML files defining GitHub Actions workflows:
   - `analytics-tests.yml`, `chat-tests.yml`, `dashboard-tests.yml`, `search-tests.yml`: Define build and lint processes for specific features.
   - `push-*.yml` files: Automate building and pushing Docker images for various components.
   - `rust-tests.yml`: Runs Rust-specific tests, formatting checks, and documentation generation.

## Configuration
The `rules.yaml` file serves as a configuration for Spectral linting within the GitHub repository. It extends the recommended OpenAPI Specification (OAS) ruleset but disables the `paths-kebab-case` rule, allowing for more flexibility in API path naming conventions.

The various workflow files in the `workflows` directory configure GitHub Actions to run on specific events (e.g., pull requests, pushes to the main branch) and define the steps for each automated process. These workflows often use environment secrets for Docker Hub authentication and specific runner environments for consistency.

Overall, this `.github` directory sets up a robust infrastructure for maintaining code quality, automating deployments, and streamlining the development process across multiple components of a complex software project.
