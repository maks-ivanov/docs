## High-level description

The `bug_report.yaml` file is a GitHub issue template designed for reporting bugs in the "marimo" project. It provides a structured format for users to submit bug reports, ensuring that all necessary information is collected to help developers understand and address the issue effectively.

## Code Structure

The YAML file defines a template with several fields that users must fill out when submitting a bug report. These fields include a description of the bug, the environment in which it occurs, and code to reproduce the issue. The template also includes labels to categorize the issue and a markdown section to thank users for their contributions.

## Symbols

### `name`
#### Description
Specifies the name of the issue template, which is "üêû Bug report". This name is displayed to users when they choose a template for their issue.

### `description`
#### Description
Provides a brief description of the purpose of the template, indicating that it is used to report issues with the "marimo" project.

### `labels`
#### Description
Defines default labels that are automatically applied to the issue when it is created. In this case, the labels are "pending triage" and "bug", which help categorize and prioritize the issue.

### `body`
#### Description
Contains the main content of the issue template, structured as a list of input fields that users must complete.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| type | string | The type of input field, such as markdown or textarea. |
| id | string | A unique identifier for the input field. |
| attributes | object | Contains additional properties for the input field, such as label, description, and placeholder text. |
| validations | object | Specifies validation rules for the input field, such as whether it is required. |

#### Internal Logic
The `body` section is composed of multiple input fields, each with specific attributes and validation rules. These fields guide the user in providing detailed information about the bug, including a description, environment details, and reproduction code.

## Dependencies

This YAML file does not have any external dependencies, as it is a configuration file used by GitHub to generate issue templates.

## Configuration

The file itself serves as a configuration for GitHub's issue tracking system, defining how bug reports should be structured and what information is required from users.

## Error Handling

There is no explicit error handling in this YAML file, as it is a static configuration file. However, the `validations` section ensures that certain fields are required, preventing users from submitting incomplete bug reports.

## Logging

There is no logging mechanism implemented in this YAML file, as it is not executable code.

## API/Interface Reference

This file does not define an API or public interface. It is used internally by GitHub to generate a user interface for submitting bug reports.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
