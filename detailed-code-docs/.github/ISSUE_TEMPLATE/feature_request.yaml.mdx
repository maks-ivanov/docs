## High-level description

The `feature_request.yaml` file is a GitHub issue template designed for proposing new features to be added to the "marimo" project. It provides a structured format for users to submit feature requests, ensuring that all necessary information is collected to evaluate the proposal effectively.

## Code Structure

The YAML file defines a template with several fields that users must fill out when submitting a feature request. These fields include a description of the feature, a suggested solution, any alternative solutions considered, and additional context. The template also includes a label for categorizing the issue.
