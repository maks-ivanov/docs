title: "documentation.yaml"
---

## High-level description
The target file is a GitHub issue template written in YAML format, specifically designed for documentation-related issues. It provides a structured way for users to suggest changes or additions to the documentation on the `docs.marimo.io` site by filling out a predefined form.

## Code Structure
The YAML file defines a template with a name, description, labels, and a body consisting of various input fields. These fields include markdown text, checkboxes, and text areas, each with specific attributes and validation rules.

## Symbols

### `name`
#### Description
Specifies the name of the issue template.
- **Value**: `"ðŸ“š Documentation"`

### `description`
#### Description
Provides a brief description of the purpose of the issue template.
- **Value**: `"Suggest a change or new page to be added to docs.marimo.io"`

### `labels`
#### Description
Defines the labels that will be automatically applied to issues created using this template.
- **Value**: `[documentation]`

### `body`
#### Description
Contains the main content of the issue template, which is a list of input fields that users must fill out.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| type | string | The type of input field (e.g., markdown, checkboxes, textarea). |
| attributes | object | Contains specific attributes for each input field, such as labels and descriptions. |
| validations | object | Specifies validation rules for the input fields, such as whether they are required. |

#### Internal Logic
- **Markdown Section**: Displays a thank you message to the user.
- **Checkboxes**: Allows users to specify the nature of the documentation issue (e.g., Missing, Outdated, Confusing, Not sure?).
- **Text Areas**: Collect detailed explanations and suggestions for changes, both of which are required fields.

## Logging
There are no logging mechanisms implemented in this YAML file.

## API/Interface Reference
