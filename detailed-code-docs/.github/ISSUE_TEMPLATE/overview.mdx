## High-level description

The `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` directory contains a set of YAML files that define issue templates for the "marimo" project on GitHub. These templates provide structured formats for users to report bugs, request features, and suggest documentation changes. Additionally, there is a configuration file that manages the availability of blank issues and provides contact links for further discussions. The main components within this directory are the individual issue templates for different types of issues and the configuration file for managing issue creation settings.

## What does it do?

The directory facilitates the process of issue reporting and management on the project's GitHub repository. By using predefined templates, it ensures that users provide all necessary information when submitting issues, which helps developers understand and address them more efficiently. The templates guide users through the process of reporting bugs, requesting new features, or suggesting documentation improvements by prompting them to fill out specific fields. This structured approach helps maintain consistency and completeness in the information provided.

- **Bug Report Template**: Users can report bugs by describing the issue, the environment in which it occurs, and providing steps to reproduce it. This helps developers quickly identify and fix problems.
  
- **Feature Request Template**: Users can propose new features by detailing the problem, suggesting a solution, and providing any alternative solutions or additional context. This aids in evaluating the feasibility and priority of new features.

- **Documentation Template**: Users can suggest changes or additions to the project's documentation by specifying the nature of the issue (e.g., missing, outdated) and providing detailed suggestions.

- **Configuration File**: This file allows the creation of blank issues and provides contact links for users to engage with the project team or community through platforms like Discord or GitHub Discussions.

Overall, these templates and configurations streamline the issue management process, making it easier for both users and developers to communicate effectively.
