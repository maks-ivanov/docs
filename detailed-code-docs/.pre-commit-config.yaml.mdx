## High-level description

The `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file is a configuration file for the pre-commit framework, which is used to manage and run pre-commit hooks in a codebase. This file specifies a set of repositories and hooks that are executed before commits are made, ensuring code quality and consistency by running various checks and fixes automatically.

## Code Structure

The configuration file is structured into a list of repositories, each containing a set of hooks. Each hook is defined with an identifier and may include additional arguments or settings such as exclusions or dependencies. The hooks are executed in the order they are listed, and the `fail_fast` option is set to `true`, meaning that the pre-commit process will stop on the first failure.

## Symbols

### `fail_fast`
#### Description
The `fail_fast` option is a configuration setting that determines whether the pre-commit process should stop immediately when a hook fails. In this file, it is set to `true`, meaning that if any hook fails, subsequent hooks will not be executed.

### `repos`
#### Description
The `repos` section lists the repositories containing the pre-commit hooks to be used. Each repository is specified with a URL and a revision (version), and contains one or more hooks.

#### Internal Logic
Each repository entry includes:
- `repo`: The URL of the repository containing the hooks.
- `rev`: The specific version or tag of the repository to use.
- `hooks`: A list of hooks to be executed, each with its own configuration.

### `hooks`
#### Description
Each hook within a repository is defined with an `id` and may include additional configuration options such as `args`, `exclude`, and `additional_dependencies`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | The identifier of the hook to be executed. |
| args | list | Optional arguments to pass to the hook. |
| exclude | string | Optional regex pattern to exclude files from being processed by the hook. |
| additional_dependencies | list | Optional list of additional dependencies required by the hook. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | boolean | The success or failure of the hook execution. |

#### Internal Logic
- `id`: Specifies the hook to be executed.
- `args`: Provides additional command-line arguments for the hook.
- `exclude`: Uses a regex pattern to exclude certain files from being processed.
- `additional_dependencies`: Lists any extra dependencies needed for the hook to run.

## Dependencies

The configuration file references several external repositories that provide the hooks:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `https://github.com/abravalheri/validate-pyproject` | Validates Python project configuration files. |
| `https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli` | Lints and optionally fixes Markdown files. |
| `https://github.com/crate-ci/typos` | Checks for and corrects typos in the codebase. |
| `https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit` | Provides linting and formatting for Python code. |
| `https://github.com/biomejs/pre-commit` | Formats code according to Biome's configuration. |

## Configuration

The file includes specific configuration options for some hooks:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| `args` | list | None | Command-line arguments for the hook. |
| `exclude` | string | None | Regex pattern to exclude files. |
| `additional_dependencies` | list | None | Extra dependencies for the hook. |

## Error Handling

The `fail_fast` option is a form of error handling, as it stops the pre-commit process on the first failure, preventing subsequent hooks from running and potentially causing further issues.

## Logging

The pre-commit framework itself typically handles logging of hook execution results, including success and failure messages, which are displayed in the console output during the commit process.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
