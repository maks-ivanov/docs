title: "analytics-service.yaml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file defines a Kubernetes Service resource for an analytics service. It exposes a ClusterIP service that routes traffic to pods labeled with the "analytics" selector.

## Table of contents
- Service definition
- Metadata
- Spec (including type, ports, and selector)

## Code Structure
The file uses Helm templating to define variables for the service name and selector, which are then used throughout the YAML definition.

### Service Resource
#### Description
Defines a Kubernetes Service of type ClusterIP named "analytics-service" that routes traffic to pods labeled as "analytics".

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| $name | string | The name of the service, set to "analytics-service" |
| $selector | string | The selector used to identify target pods, set to "analytics" |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the API version and kind for a Kubernetes Service resource.
2. Defines metadata including the service name and labels.
3. Specifies the service type as ClusterIP.
4. Configures a single port mapping from port 80 to targetPort 80.
5. Sets the selector to match pods with specific labels.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Kubernetes | The target platform for deploying this service |
| Helm | Templating engine used for variable substitution |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| spec.type | string | ClusterIP | Defines the type of Kubernetes service |
| spec.ports[0].port | integer | 80 | The port on which the service is exposed |
| spec.ports[0].targetPort | integer | 80 | The port to which traffic is forwarded on the target pods |
| spec.ports[0].protocol | string | TCP | The protocol used for this port |

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| analytics-service:80 | Any | N/A | N/A | Exposes the analytics service within the cluster |

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding health check probes to ensure service reliability.
- Implement multiple ports if the analytics service requires different endpoints.
- Add annotations for integrating with cloud provider load balancers or service meshes.
- Consider using named ports instead of hardcoded port numbers for better maintainability.
