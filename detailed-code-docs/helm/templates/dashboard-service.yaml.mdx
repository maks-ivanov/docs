## High-level description
This YAML file defines a Kubernetes Service resource for a dashboard application. It creates a ClusterIP service that routes traffic to pods labeled as the dashboard application within the cluster.

## Table of contents
- Service definition
- Metadata
- Spec
  - Service type
  - Ports
  - Selector

## Code Structure
The file uses Helm templating to define a Kubernetes Service resource. It sets up variables for the service name and selector, then uses these in the resource definition.

### Service Resource
#### Description
Defines a Kubernetes Service of type ClusterIP for the dashboard application.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up variables for name and selector
2. Defines metadata with name and labels
3. Specifies service type as ClusterIP
4. Configures port mapping
5. Sets up selector for targeting pods

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Kubernetes | The target platform for deploying this service |
| Helm | Templating engine used for variable substitution and resource generation |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| $name | string | "dashboard-service" | Name of the service |
| $selector | string | "dashboard" | Label selector for targeting pods |

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| ClusterIP:80 | HTTP | N/A | Dashboard UI | Exposes the dashboard application within the cluster |

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding annotations for additional metadata or integrations
- Evaluate if exposing the service externally (e.g., LoadBalancer or NodePort) is needed
- Add health check probes to ensure service reliability
