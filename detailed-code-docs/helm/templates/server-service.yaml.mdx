## High-level description
This Helm template defines a Kubernetes Service for a server application and, when deployed in Google Cloud, includes a BackendConfig for health checks. It sets up networking for the server, allowing it to be accessed within the cluster and configuring health checks for Google Cloud load balancing.

## Table of contents
- BackendConfig (for Google Cloud environment)
- Service definition

## Code Structure
The template uses Helm variables and conditionals to create two Kubernetes resources:
1. A BackendConfig (only for Google Cloud environment)
2. A Service for the server application

## Symbols

### BackendConfig
#### Description
Defines a Google Cloud-specific resource for configuring backend services, specifically for health checks.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| $.Values.environment | string | The deployment environment |

#### Internal Logic
- Only created when the environment is "gcloud"
- Sets up a health check configuration for the server

### Service
#### Description
Defines a Kubernetes Service resource to expose the server application within the cluster.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| $name | string | The name of the service |
| $selector | string | The selector for targeting pods |
| .Release.Name | string | The Helm release name |

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a ClusterIP type Service
- Configures the service port and target port
- Sets up selectors to target the correct pods
- Adds an annotation for Google Cloud backend configuration

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Kubernetes | For Service resource definition |
| Google Cloud (optional) | For BackendConfig resource |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| environment | string | N/A | Determines if Google Cloud specific resources are created |

## Future Improvements
1. Consider parameterizing the health check settings (port, path, interval) to allow for easier customization.
2. Add support for other cloud providers' specific configurations, using similar conditionals as the Google Cloud BackendConfig.
3. Consider adding the ability to configure multiple ports or protocols if the server might need to expose additional services.
4. Implement optional TLS configuration for secure communication.
5. Add the ability to customize the Service type (e.g., LoadBalancer, NodePort) based on deployment requirements.
