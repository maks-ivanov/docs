## High-level description
This YAML file defines a Kubernetes Service resource for a Tika application. It exposes the Tika service within the cluster on port 9998 and selects pods with specific labels to route traffic to.

## Table of contents
- Service definition
- Metadata
- Spec
  - Service type
  - Ports
  - Selector

## Code Structure
The YAML file consists of a single Kubernetes Service resource definition with metadata and spec sections.

## Symbols

### Service
#### Description
Defines a Kubernetes Service resource named "tika" that exposes the Tika application within the cluster.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| $selector | string | A variable set to "tika", used in the selector |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the API version and kind for the Kubernetes Service resource
2. Defines metadata including name and labels
3. Specifies the service type as ClusterIP
4. Configures the port settings
5. Sets up a selector to identify the pods this service will route traffic to

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Kubernetes | The target platform for deploying this service |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| port | integer | 9998 | The port on which the service is exposed |
| targetPort | integer | 9998 | The port on the pod to which traffic is forwarded |

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| :9998 | Any | N/A | N/A | Exposes the Tika service within the cluster |

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding health check probes (readiness and liveness) to ensure the service's reliability
- Evaluate if additional ports or protocols are needed for the Tika service
- Assess whether the ClusterIP service type is sufficient or if external access is required (e.g., NodePort or LoadBalancer)
