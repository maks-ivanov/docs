## High-level description
This directory contains Helm charts for deploying the Trieve application to a Kubernetes cluster. The charts define various Kubernetes resources, including Deployments, Services, Ingress, and NetworkPolicies, to set up the application's infrastructure and networking.

## What does it do?
This code defines the infrastructure and configuration for deploying the Trieve application on a Kubernetes cluster. It uses Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes, to define, install, and upgrade Kubernetes applications. The charts in this directory specify the necessary resources, such as deployments, services, and ingress, to run the Trieve application in different environments, including local, AWS, and Google Cloud.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this directory are the individual YAML files, each defining a specific aspect of the Trieve application deployment. Developers should start by examining the deployment and service files for each component of the application, such as `analytics-deployment.yaml`, `analytics-service.yaml`, `chat-deployment.yaml`, `chat-service.yaml`, and so on. These files define how each component is deployed and exposed within the cluster.

The ingress files (`ingress-aws.yaml`, `ingress-gcloud.yaml`, `ingress-local.yaml`) define how external traffic is routed to the services within the cluster based on the environment. The `keycloak.yaml` and `keycloak-realm-configmap.yaml` files handle the Keycloak setup for authentication and authorization.

## Key Files
