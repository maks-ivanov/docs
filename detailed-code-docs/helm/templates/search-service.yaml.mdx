title: "search-service.yaml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file defines a Kubernetes Service resource for a search service. It creates a ClusterIP service that routes traffic to pods labeled with the "search" selector, exposing port 80 for internal cluster communication.

## Table of contents
- Service definition
- Metadata
- Spec
  - Service type
  - Ports
  - Selector

## Code Structure
The file uses Helm templating to define a Kubernetes Service resource. It sets up variables for the service name and selector, then uses these variables and Helm release information to configure the service.

## Symbols

### Service Resource
#### Description
Defines a Kubernetes Service of type ClusterIP for the search service.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| .Release.Name | string | The name of the Helm release |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up variables for service name and selector
2. Defines metadata including name and labels
3. Specifies service type as ClusterIP
4. Configures port mapping
5. Sets up selector for targeting pods

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Kubernetes | The target platform for deploying the service |
| Helm | Used for templating and managing the Kubernetes resource |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| $name | string | "search-service" | The name of the Kubernetes Service |
| $selector | string | "search" | The selector used to target pods |

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| :80 | TCP | N/A | N/A | Exposes port 80 for internal cluster communication |

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding health check endpoints or readiness probes for improved service reliability.
- If needed, add support for multiple ports or protocols in the service definition.
- Implement service mesh integration for advanced traffic management and observability.
