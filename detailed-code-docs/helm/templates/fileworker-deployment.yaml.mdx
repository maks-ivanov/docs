title: "fileworker-deployment.yaml"
---

## High-level description
This Kubernetes Deployment YAML file defines the configuration for deploying a "file-worker" application. It sets up the necessary metadata, container specifications, and environment variables required for the file worker to operate within a Kubernetes cluster.

## Table of contents
- Metadata
- Deployment Specification
- Pod Template
- Container Specification
- Environment Variables
- Cloud SQL Proxy (for Google Cloud environment)

## Code Structure
The YAML file defines a Kubernetes Deployment resource with the following main sections:
- Metadata: Defines the name and labels for the deployment
- Spec: Contains the selector and template for the deployment
- Template: Defines the pod template, including container specifications and environment variables
- Containers: Specifies the main file-worker container and, conditionally, a Cloud SQL Proxy container

## Symbols

### Deployment
#### Description
Defines a Kubernetes Deployment for the file-worker application, ensuring that a specified number of pod replicas are running.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| .Release.Name | String | The name of the Helm release |
| .Values | Object | Values passed to the Helm chart |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up metadata and labels for the deployment
2. Defines a selector to match pods
3. Specifies a pod template with container configurations
4. Conditionally includes a Cloud SQL Proxy container for Google Cloud environments
5. Sets numerous environment variables for the file-worker container

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Helm | Template rendering and value substitution |
| Kubernetes | Deployment and container orchestration |

### Configuration
The deployment uses various configuration options defined in the Helm values. Key configurations include:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| environment | String | Deployment environment (e.g., "gcloud", "local") |
| containers.file_worker.tag | String | Docker image tag for the file-worker container |
| config.trieve | Object | Various Trieve-specific configurations |
| config.redis | Object | Redis configuration |
| config.qdrant | Object | Qdrant configuration |
| config.smtp | Object | SMTP configuration for email |
| config.openai | Object | OpenAI API configuration |
| config.s3 | Object | S3 storage configuration |
| config.stripe | Object | Stripe payment configuration |
| config.oidc | Object | OpenID Connect configuration |
| config.analytics | Object | Analytics configuration (ClickHouse) |

## Future Improvements
1. Consider using Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive information instead of passing them as environment variables.
2. Implement resource requests and limits for the file-worker container to ensure proper resource allocation.
3. Add readiness and liveness probes to improve the reliability and availability of the file-worker pods.
4. Consider using ConfigMaps for non-sensitive configuration data to separate configuration from the deployment template.
5. Implement horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) to automatically adjust the number of file-worker pods based on workload.
