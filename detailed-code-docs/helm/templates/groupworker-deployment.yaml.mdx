## High-level description
This file, `helm/templates/groupworker-deployment.yaml`, defines a Kubernetes Deployment for a "group-worker" service. It sets up the container specifications, environment variables, and resource configurations for the group worker component of the Trieve application.

## Table of contents
- Metadata
- Selector
- Template
  - Metadata
  - Spec
    - Service Account
    - Containers
      - group-worker container
      - cloud-sql-proxy container (conditional)

## Code Structure
The main structure is a Kubernetes Deployment resource. It defines a single pod template with one or two containers:
1. The main "group-worker" container
2. An optional "cloud-sql-proxy" container for Google Cloud SQL connectivity (only included when deployed to Google Cloud)

## Symbols
### Deployment
#### Description
Defines a Kubernetes Deployment for the group-worker service.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up metadata and labels for the deployment
- Defines a selector for pod management
- Specifies the pod template with container configurations

### Container: group-worker
#### Description
The main container for the group-worker service.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the image based on the environment and tag
- Defines numerous environment variables for configuration

### Container: cloud-sql-proxy (conditional)
#### Description
An optional container for Google Cloud SQL connectivity.

#### Internal Logic
- Only included when the environment is "gcloud"
- Sets up the Cloud SQL proxy with appropriate configurations

## Dependencies
- Helm: This is a Helm template, utilizing Helm's templating syntax
- Kubernetes: The deployment is designed for a Kubernetes cluster

## Configuration
The deployment uses various Helm values for configuration, including:
- `.Values.environment`
- `.Values.containers.group_worker.tag`
- `.Values.config.*` (various configuration settings)

## Future Improvements
1. Consider using Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive environment variables instead of plain text.
2. Implement resource limits for the group-worker container to ensure proper resource allocation.
3. Add readiness and liveness probes to improve the reliability and availability of the service.
4. Consider using a ConfigMap for non-sensitive configuration to improve maintainability.
5. Implement horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) for the deployment to handle varying loads efficiently.
