## High-level description
This YAML file, `helm/local-values.yaml`, defines configuration values for a local deployment of the Trieve application using Helm. It includes settings for various components like databases, APIs, authentication, and external services.

## Table of contents
- Environment Configuration
- Container Image Tags
- Postgres Configuration
- Application Configuration
- Embeddings Configuration

## Symbols
### `environment`
#### Description
Specifies the deployment environment, set to "local" for local deployments.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a top-level configuration value.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a configuration value.

### `domain`
#### Description
Defines the base domain used for local deployments. Only applicable when `environment` is set to "local".

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a top-level configuration value.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a configuration value.

### `useGpu`
#### Description
A boolean flag indicating whether to utilize GPU resources in the deployment.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a top-level configuration value.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a configuration value.

### `containers`
#### Description
This section lists Docker image tags for various services within the Trieve application.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a section containing key-value pairs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a configuration section.

### `postgres`
#### Description
Configures the PostgreSQL database connection.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a section containing key-value pairs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a configuration section.

#### Internal Logic
- `useSubchart`: Determines whether to use a subchart for deploying PostgreSQL or rely on an external instance.
- `dbURI`: Provides the connection URI for the PostgreSQL database when not using a subchart.

### `config`
#### Description
This section encompasses various application-level configurations.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a section containing key-value pairs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a configuration section.

#### Internal Logic
- `vite`:  Sets up configurations for the Vite frontend build, including API endpoints and Sentry integration.
- `redis`: Configures the Redis connection, similar to PostgreSQL, with an option to use a subchart or an external instance.
- `qdrant`:  Defines settings for the Qdrant vector database, including connection details, collection name, and vector quantization options.
- `analytics`: Manages analytics settings, enabling or disabling them and providing ClickHouse database connection parameters.
- `trieve`: Contains core Trieve application settings, such as API keys, service URLs, and security configurations.
- `oidc`: Sets up OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication parameters, including client credentials and issuer URL.
- `smtp`:  Defines SMTP settings for sending emails, including relay server, credentials, and sender address.
- `llm`:  Specifies the API key for the chosen Large Language Model (LLM).
- `openai`: Configures OpenAI API access with the API key and base URL.
- `s3`:  Provides Amazon S3 storage settings, including endpoint, access keys, bucket name, and region.
- `stripe`:  Sets up Stripe payment gateway integration with secret keys and dashboard URL.

### `embeddings`
#### Description
This section defines a list of embedding models used by the application.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a list of dictionaries.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a configuration section.

#### Internal Logic
Each entry in the list represents an embedding model with properties like:
- `name`:  A descriptive name for the embedding model.
- `revision`:  Specifies the model revision or version.
- `model`:  The identifier or path to the embedding model itself.
- `args`:  An array of additional arguments passed to the embedding model.

## References
- This configuration file is referenced during Helm deployments to customize the Trieve application.
- The `related code snippets` provide context on how some of these values are used within the application code.

## Dependencies
- This configuration file implicitly depends on the structure and expected values of the Helm charts used to deploy the Trieve application.

## Configuration
This entire file serves as a configuration file, defining various settings for the Trieve application. Each top-level key represents a configuration section or a specific value.
