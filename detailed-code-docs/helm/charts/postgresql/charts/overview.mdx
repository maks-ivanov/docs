## High-level description
This directory houses the Bitnami Common Helm Chart, a library chart providing reusable templates and logic for other Bitnami charts. It aims to reduce code duplication and ensure consistency across different deployments.

## What does it do?
This directory contains a Helm chart that acts as a library of code and templates for other Helm charts. It doesn't deploy anything on its own but provides building blocks for other charts to use. For example, it might include templates for creating Kubernetes ConfigMaps or Secrets with specific settings, which other charts can then reuse.

## Key Files
### README.md
Provides a detailed explanation of the common library chart, including its purpose, usage instructions, and available parameters. It also showcases examples of how to use the provided templates and schemas.

### values.yaml
Defines an example value used primarily for testing and CI/CD processes. This file can be customized with additional configuration options common to multiple Helm charts.

### Chart.yaml
This file defines the metadata for the Helm chart, including its version, maintainers, and dependencies. It specifies that this is a library chart, meaning it's not meant to be deployed independently but used as a dependency in other charts.
