## High-level description
This Helm chart template generates Kubernetes Secret resources for a PostgreSQL deployment. It creates secrets for various PostgreSQL authentication credentials, including admin, user, replication, and LDAP passwords. Additionally, it can create service binding secrets for use with the Service Binding Operator.

## Table of contents
- Secret generation for PostgreSQL credentials
- Service binding secret generation for postgres user
- Service binding secret generation for custom user

## Code Structure
The template uses several variables and conditional statements to determine which secrets to create and what data to include in them. It leverages Helm functions and helpers to retrieve and process values from the chart's configuration.

## Symbols

### PostgreSQL Secret
#### Description
Creates a Kubernetes Secret resource containing PostgreSQL authentication credentials.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| .Values | Object | Chart values |
| .Release | Object | Release information |

#### Outputs
A Kubernetes Secret resource with PostgreSQL credentials.

#### Internal Logic
1. Determines various passwords (postgres, user, replication, LDAP) based on chart values and helper functions.
2. Creates a Secret resource if conditions are met.
3. Populates the Secret with base64 encoded password values.

### Service Binding Secret for Postgres User
#### Description
Creates a Kubernetes Secret resource for service binding with the postgres user credentials.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| .Values | Object | Chart values |
| .Release | Object | Release information |

#### Outputs
A Kubernetes Secret resource of type `servicebinding.io/postgresql` for the postgres user.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates the Secret only if service bindings are enabled and a postgres password exists.
2. Populates the Secret with connection details including host, port, username, password, and URI.

### Service Binding Secret for Custom User
#### Description
Creates a Kubernetes Secret resource for service binding with custom user credentials.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| .Values | Object | Chart values |
| .Release | Object | Release information |

#### Outputs
A Kubernetes Secret resource of type `servicebinding.io/postgresql` for the custom user.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates the Secret only if service bindings are enabled and a custom user password exists.
2. Populates the Secret with connection details including host, port, username, password, database, and URI.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| common | Provides helper functions for naming, labels, and secret management |

## Configuration
The template uses various configuration options from the chart's values. Key options include:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| architecture | String | Determines if replication is enabled |
| auth | Object | Contains authentication-related settings |
| ldap | Object | LDAP configuration settings |
| serviceBindings.enabled | Boolean | Enables/disables service binding secret creation |

## Future Improvements
1. Consider separating the logic for different secret types into separate helper templates for improved readability and maintainability.
2. Implement a more robust error handling mechanism for cases where required passwords are not provided or cannot be generated.
3. Add support for additional authentication methods or external secret management systems.
4. Consider adding annotations for secret rotation or management by external tools.
