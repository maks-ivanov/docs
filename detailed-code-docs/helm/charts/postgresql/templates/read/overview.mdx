## High-level description
This directory contains Kubernetes YAML templates for deploying and managing PostgreSQL read replicas in a replication architecture using Helm. It provides resources for service discovery, metrics collection, network policy configuration, and monitoring.

## What does it do?
This code defines the infrastructure and configurations for running read-only copies of a PostgreSQL database. These replicas improve read performance and availability by distributing read requests across multiple instances. The code ensures that these replicas stay synchronized with the primary database and can be easily monitored and scaled.

## Key Files
### read/extended-configmap.yaml
This template creates a ConfigMap containing custom configurations for PostgreSQL read replicas. It allows users to override default settings and fine-tune replica behavior.

### read/metrics-configmap.yaml
This template creates a ConfigMap for storing custom PostgreSQL metrics definitions specific to read replicas. It enables users to monitor replica performance based on tailored metrics.

### read/metrics-svc.yaml
This template defines a Kubernetes Service that exposes PostgreSQL metrics from read replicas. It allows monitoring tools to scrape and collect metrics data from the replicas.

### read/networkpolicy.yaml
This template defines a NetworkPolicy that controls network traffic to and from PostgreSQL read replica pods. It enhances security by restricting access and only allowing communication from authorized sources.

### read/servicemonitor.yaml
This template defines a ServiceMonitor resource for monitoring PostgreSQL read replicas using Prometheus Operator. It integrates replica monitoring with Prometheus and enables users to set up alerts and dashboards for observability.

### read/statefulset.yaml
This template defines a StatefulSet for deploying and managing PostgreSQL read replica pods. It ensures that replicas have stable network identities, persistent storage, and are properly initialized for replication.

### read/svc-headless.yaml
This template defines a headless Kubernetes Service for PostgreSQL read replicas. It enables internal service discovery within the cluster, allowing other pods to connect to replicas using their DNS names.

### read/svc.yaml
This template defines a Kubernetes Service that exposes PostgreSQL read replicas to external clients or services. It provides a stable endpoint for accessing read-only data from the replicas.
