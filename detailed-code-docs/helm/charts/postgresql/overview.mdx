## High-level description
This directory contains the Helm chart for deploying PostgreSQL on Kubernetes. It provides a flexible and customizable way to set up PostgreSQL databases, including options for replication, backups, monitoring, and security configurations.

## What does it do?
This Helm chart automates the deployment and management of PostgreSQL databases in Kubernetes environments. It offers the following key functionalities:

1. Deploys PostgreSQL instances as StatefulSets with configurable resources and storage.
2. Supports both standalone and replication architectures.
3. Manages database credentials and configurations securely.
4. Sets up services for database access.
5. Configures backup jobs with customizable schedules.
6. Implements security measures through RBAC, network policies, and TLS.
7. Provides Prometheus integration for monitoring.
8. Allows extensive customization through a comprehensive values.yaml file.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this Helm chart are:

1. `Chart.yaml`: Defines the chart metadata and dependencies.
2. `values.yaml`: The primary configuration file where users can customize their PostgreSQL deployment.
3. `templates/` directory: Contains the Kubernetes manifest templates for various resources.
4. `README.md`: Provides documentation on how to use and configure the chart.

## Key Files
1. `Chart.yaml`: Specifies chart metadata, version, and dependencies.
2. `values.yaml`: The main configuration file for customizing the PostgreSQL deployment.
3. `values.schema.json`: Defines the schema for validating the values.yaml file.
4. `templates/` directory:
   - `primary/statefulset.yaml`: Defines the primary PostgreSQL instance.
   - `read/statefulset.yaml`: Configures read replicas when enabled.
   - `secrets.yaml`: Manages database credentials.
   - `backup/cronjob.yaml`: Sets up scheduled backups.
   - Various other templates for services, config maps, and security policies.
5. `README.md`: Comprehensive documentation for the chart.

## Dependencies
The chart has the following main dependencies:

1. Kubernetes: The underlying container orchestration platform.
2. Helm: The package manager used for deploying the chart.
3. PostgreSQL: The core database engine.
4. Bitnami Common Library: A shared library chart providing common templates and helpers.
5. Prometheus Operator (optional): For advanced monitoring capabilities.

## Configuration
The chart is highly configurable through its `values.yaml` file. Key configuration options include:

1. PostgreSQL version and image settings
2. Authentication and database initialization
3. Replication configuration
4. Resource allocation (CPU, memory, storage)
5. Backup schedules and retention policies
6. Security settings (RBAC, network policies, TLS)
7. Monitoring and metrics collection options

Users can customize these settings to tailor the PostgreSQL deployment to their specific requirements and environment. The `values.schema.json` file provides a schema for validating the configuration options.
