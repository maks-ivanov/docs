## High-level description
This directory contains Helm charts for deploying three key database systems on Kubernetes: PostgreSQL, Qdrant (a vector database), and Redis. Each chart provides a flexible and customizable way to deploy and manage these databases in Kubernetes environments, offering various deployment architectures, security configurations, monitoring options, and performance optimizations.

## What does it do?
These Helm charts automate the deployment and management of PostgreSQL, Qdrant, and Redis in Kubernetes environments. Key functionalities include:

1. Deploying database instances as StatefulSets with configurable resources and storage.
2. Supporting various deployment architectures (e.g., standalone, replication, sentinel mode for Redis).
3. Managing database credentials and configurations securely.
4. Setting up services for database access and internal communication.
5. Configuring backup jobs with customizable schedules (for PostgreSQL).
6. Implementing security measures through RBAC, network policies, and TLS.
7. Providing Prometheus integration for monitoring.
8. Allowing extensive customization through comprehensive values.yaml files.
9. Managing persistent storage for data retention.
10. Implementing health checks and readiness probes.
11. Configuring horizontal pod autoscaling (for Redis).

## Entry points
The main entry points for these Helm charts are:

1. `values.yaml`: The primary configuration file for customizing each database deployment.
2. `templates/` directory: Contains the Kubernetes manifest templates for various resources.
3. `Chart.yaml`: Defines the chart metadata and dependencies.
4. `README.md`: Provides documentation on how to use and configure each chart.

For specific databases:
- PostgreSQL: `templates/primary/statefulset.yaml` and `templates/read/statefulset.yaml`
- Qdrant: `templates/statefulset.yaml` and `templates/configmap.yaml`
- Redis: `templates/master/application.yaml`, `templates/replicas/application.yaml`, and `templates/sentinel/statefulset.yaml`

## Key Files
1. `values.yaml`: The main configuration file for customizing each database deployment.
2. `values.schema.json`: Defines the schema for validating the values.yaml file.
3. `templates/` directory:
   - StatefulSet definitions for database instances
   - ConfigMaps for database configurations
   - Secrets for managing credentials
   - Service definitions for database access
   - Ingress configurations (where applicable)
   - PodDisruptionBudget definitions
   - ServiceMonitor and PodMonitor resources for Prometheus integration
4. `charts/common/`: Bitnami common library chart providing shared templates and helpers.

## Dependencies
The charts have the following main dependencies:

1. Kubernetes: The underlying container orchestration platform.
2. Helm: The package manager used for deploying the charts.
3. Respective database engines: PostgreSQL, Qdrant, and Redis.
4. Bitnami Common Library: A shared library chart providing common templates and helpers.
5. Prometheus Operator (optional): For advanced monitoring capabilities.
6. PV provisioner: Required for persistent storage (provided by the infrastructure).

## Configuration
Each chart is highly configurable through its `values.yaml` file. Key configuration options include:

1. Database version and image settings
2. Authentication and database initialization
3. Replication and high availability configurations
4. Resource allocation (CPU, memory, storage)
5. Backup schedules and retention policies (for PostgreSQL)
6. Security settings (RBAC, network policies, TLS)
7. Monitoring and metrics collection options
8. Ingress configurations for external access
9. Persistence settings for data storage

Users can customize these settings to tailor each database deployment to their specific requirements and environment. The `values.schema.json` files provide schemas for validating the configuration options, ensuring that users provide valid inputs for the deployments.
