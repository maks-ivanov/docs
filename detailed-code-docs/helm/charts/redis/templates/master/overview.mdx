## High-level description
This directory contains Kubernetes YAML templates for deploying a Redis master node within a Helm chart. It provides configuration options for deploying the master as a StatefulSet or Deployment, managing persistence, exposing services, and defining security contexts.

## What does it do?
This code defines how a Redis master node is set up and run within a Kubernetes cluster. It allows users to customize various aspects of the deployment, such as:

- **Redis Configuration:** Image version, authentication, TLS settings.
- **Persistence:** Enabling persistent storage, choosing storage class, and size.
- **Service Exposure:** Service type, load balancing, port configuration.
- **Security:** Defining PodSecurityPolicies and ServiceAccounts.

The templates use Helm's templating language to allow for dynamic configuration based on user-provided values. When the Helm chart is deployed, these templates are rendered into valid Kubernetes YAML manifests, which are then applied to the cluster.

## Key Files
### application.yaml
This file defines the core deployment logic for the Redis master. It creates either a StatefulSet or Deployment based on the desired architecture and configuration. It also manages container specifications for Redis and an optional metrics exporter, volume mounts, and persistent volume claims.

### psp.yaml
This file defines a PodSecurityPolicy for the Redis master pod. It enforces security constraints related to privileges, file system access, and user/group permissions.

### pvc.yaml
This file defines a PersistentVolumeClaim for the Redis master, enabling persistent storage for Redis data. It allows configuration of access modes, storage size, and other parameters.

### service.yaml
This file defines a Kubernetes Service to expose the Redis master. It allows customization of service type, load balancing settings, port configuration, and other service-related parameters.

### serviceaccount.yaml
This file defines a ServiceAccount for the Redis master, which can be used to control the permissions and access rights of the Redis master pod within the Kubernetes cluster.
