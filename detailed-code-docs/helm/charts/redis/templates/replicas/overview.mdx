## High-level description
This directory contains Kubernetes YAML templates for deploying Redis replicas in a replication architecture using Helm. It includes templates for deploying the replicas themselves, as well as supporting resources like Horizontal Pod Autoscalers, Services, and Service Accounts. 

## What does it do?
This code defines how Redis replicas are deployed and managed within a Kubernetes cluster. It allows for scaling the number of replicas based on CPU and memory usage, exposes them to the cluster through a Service, and manages their lifecycle. 

## Entry points
The main entry point is `application.yaml`, which defines the deployment of the Redis replicas themselves. Other files, like `hpa.yaml`, `service.yaml`, and `serviceaccount.yaml`, define supporting resources that are conditionally created based on the configuration values provided to the Helm chart.

## Key Files
- **application.yaml:** This file defines the Redis replica deployment as a StatefulSet (or other specified resource kind). It configures pod specifications, container settings for Redis and metrics, volumes, and other deployment parameters.
- **hpa.yaml:** This file defines a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for the Redis replicas, enabling automatic scaling based on CPU and memory utilization.
- **service.yaml:** This file defines a Kubernetes Service to expose the Redis replicas to the cluster, allowing other applications to connect to them.
- **serviceaccount.yaml:** This file defines a ServiceAccount for the Redis replicas, which can be used to control their permissions within the cluster.
