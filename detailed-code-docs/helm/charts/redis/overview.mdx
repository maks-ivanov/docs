## High-level description
This directory contains Helm chart templates and configuration files for deploying Redis, an open-source, advanced key-value store. The chart supports various deployment architectures including standalone, replication, and sentinel modes. It provides extensive customization options for Redis configuration, security, persistence, monitoring, and scaling.

## What does it do?
This Helm chart automates the deployment and management of Redis in Kubernetes environments. Key functionalities include:

1. Deploying Redis master and replica nodes
2. Configuring Redis Sentinel for high availability
3. Setting up monitoring using Prometheus exporters
4. Managing TLS certificates for secure communication
5. Configuring authentication and RBAC
6. Providing horizontal pod autoscaling
7. Managing persistent storage for Redis data
8. Configuring network policies and pod security
9. Allowing customization of Redis configuration through ConfigMaps
10. Supporting service binding for easy integration with other applications

## Entry points
The main entry points for this Helm chart are:

1. `values.yaml`: The primary configuration file for customizing the Redis deployment
2. `templates/configmap.yaml`: Defines the core Redis configuration
3. `templates/master/application.yaml`: Deploys the Redis master node
4. `templates/replicas/application.yaml`: Deploys Redis replica nodes
5. `templates/sentinel/statefulset.yaml`: Deploys Redis Sentinel nodes (if enabled)

## Key Files
1. `Chart.yaml`: Defines metadata for the Redis Helm chart
2. `values.yaml`: Contains default configuration values for the chart
3. `values.schema.json`: JSON schema for validating the values.yaml file
4. `templates/`: Directory containing Kubernetes resource templates
5. `charts/common/`: Bitnami common library chart for shared templates and functions

## Dependencies
The chart relies on several external dependencies:

1. Kubernetes: The underlying platform for deployment
2. Helm: The package manager used to deploy and manage the chart
3. Prometheus Operator: For ServiceMonitor and PodMonitor resources (optional)
4. Redis: The core application being deployed
5. Bitnami common library: Provides helper templates and functions

## Configuration
The chart offers extensive configuration options through its `values.yaml` file. Key configuration areas include:

- Redis version and image settings
- Architecture selection (standalone, replication, sentinel)
- Authentication and security settings
- Persistence configuration
- Resource allocation and scaling options
- Monitoring and metrics settings
- Network and TLS configurations

Users can customize these settings to tailor the Redis deployment to their specific requirements.

The chart uses a JSON schema (`values.schema.json`) to validate the configuration options, ensuring that users provide valid inputs for the deployment.
