## High-level description
This directory houses a Helm library chart named "common," a collection of reusable templates and functions for Bitnami charts. It's not meant to be deployed independently but serves as a shared foundation for other Bitnami charts.

## What does it do?
This directory provides building blocks for other Helm charts, offering pre-built functionalities and configurations. It's like a toolbox for Helm chart developers, allowing them to reuse common logic and avoid code duplication across different charts.

## Entry points
- **`Chart.yaml`**: Defines metadata for the chart, including its type as "library," indicating it's not for standalone deployment.
- **`README.md`**: Provides documentation on using the common library chart, including prerequisites, parameters, and examples.
- **`values.yaml`**: Sets a minimal configuration for the common chart, primarily used for identification or verification purposes.

## Key Files
### helm/charts/redis/charts/common/README.md
This file is the main documentation for the common library chart. It explains how to include the library as a dependency in other charts and provides detailed descriptions and examples of the available templates and functions.

Key sections include:
- **Special input schemas**: Defines data structures like `ImageRoot`, `Persistence`, `ExistingSecret`, and `ValidateValue` for consistent configuration across charts.
- **Upgrading**: Guides users on upgrading the common library chart, particularly highlighting changes introduced in version 1.0.0 and the migration from Helm v2 to v3.

The README is crucial for developers using the common library chart, as it provides the necessary information to understand and utilize its functionalities effectively.
