title: "configmap.yaml"

## High-level description
This Kubernetes ConfigMap YAML file defines configuration for a Qdrant deployment. It includes an initialization script and a production configuration, tailored for different scenarios including snapshot restoration and multi-pod setups.

## Table of contents
- ConfigMap metadata
- Data section
  - initialize.sh script
  - production.yaml configuration

## Code Structure
The file defines a single Kubernetes ConfigMap resource with two main data items: an initialization script (`initialize.sh`) and a production configuration (`production.yaml`).

## Symbols

### ConfigMap
#### Description
Defines a Kubernetes ConfigMap resource named using the `qdrant.fullname` template function.

#### Data Items
1. `initialize.sh`: A shell script for initializing Qdrant pods.
2. `production.yaml`: Contains the Qdrant production configuration.

### initialize.sh
#### Description
A shell script that initializes Qdrant pods based on their index and deployment configuration.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts the pod index from the hostname.
2. Handles two main scenarios:
   a. Snapshot restoration (when enabled and replica count is 1)
   b. Normal initialization (for multi-pod setups)
3. For normal initialization:
   - Pod 0 starts without a bootstrap URL
   - Other pods use Pod 0 as the bootstrap node

#### Performance Considerations
The script uses different initialization logic for the first pod (index 0) and subsequent pods, which is crucial for proper cluster formation in a multi-pod setup.

### production.yaml
#### Description
Contains the Qdrant production configuration, populated from the `.Values.config` in the Helm chart.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Helm | Used for template rendering and value interpolation |

## Configuration
The configuration is primarily driven by Helm values:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| .Values.snapshotRestoration.enabled | boolean | Enables snapshot restoration mode |
| .Values.replicaCount | integer | Number of replica pods |
| .Values.snapshotRestoration.snapshots | list | List of snapshots to restore |
| .Values.config | map | Qdrant production configuration |

## Future Improvements
1. Consider adding error handling and logging to the `initialize.sh` script for better debugging.
2. The script could be enhanced to handle more complex initialization scenarios, such as rolling updates or recovery from failures.
3. Add comments in the YAML file to explain the purpose of each section, especially for the conditional logic in `initialize.sh`.
