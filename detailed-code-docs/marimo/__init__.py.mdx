## High-level description

The `marimo/__init__.py` file serves as the main entry point for the Marimo library, which is designed to enhance notebooks with interactive UI elements, dynamic markdown, and data transformation capabilities. It provides a collection of modules and functions that facilitate the creation of immersive and interactive notebook experiences.

## Code Structure

The file primarily consists of import statements and the definition of the `__all__` list, which specifies the public API of the Marimo library. The imports are organized into several categories, including application components, output formatting, plugins, runtime utilities, and server functionalities.

## Symbols

### `__all__`
#### Description
The `__all__` list defines the public API of the Marimo library. It includes the names of classes, functions, and modules that are intended to be accessible when the library is imported.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `__all__` | list | A list of strings representing the public API of the Marimo library. |

### `__version__`
#### Description
The `__version__` variable specifies the current version of the Marimo library.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `__version__` | str | The version number of the Marimo library. |

## Dependencies

The file imports several modules from the Marimo library, which are organized into sub-packages such as `_ast`, `_islands`, `_output`, `_plugins`, `_runtime`, and `_server`. These modules provide the necessary functionality for building and managing interactive notebook applications.

## Error Handling

The file does not implement specific error handling mechanisms, as it primarily serves as an entry point for importing and organizing the library's components.

## Logging

The file does not implement logging mechanisms directly. However, logging may be implemented in the imported modules to track and report the library's operations and any issues that arise during execution.
