## High-level description

The `marimo/_snippets/data` directory contains a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate various data manipulation and visualization techniques using the Marimo framework. Marimo is a framework for creating interactive applications and notebooks, and these scripts showcase its capabilities in organizing code into cells, managing application state, and integrating with libraries like Pandas and Altair for data processing and visualization. The scripts cover a wide range of functionalities, including data visualization with Altair, data manipulation with Pandas, and handling query parameters in a notebook environment.

## What does it do?

The scripts in this directory are designed to demonstrate how to use the Marimo framework to create interactive applications and notebooks. Each script is structured into cells, which are functions decorated with `@app.cell`. These cells can contain code for data processing, visualization, or UI elements, and they are executed as part of a Marimo application. The scripts cover various use cases, such as:

- **Data Visualization**: Using Altair to create interactive charts like scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, and line plots. These visualizations are often based on datasets from the `vega_datasets` library.
- **Data Manipulation**: Using Pandas to perform operations like creating DataFrames, querying data, handling timestamps, and transforming data structures. The scripts demonstrate techniques such as filtering, grouping, and sorting data.
- **Query Parameters**: Demonstrating how to read and manipulate query parameters in a notebook environment, allowing for state persistence and sharing of specific application states via URLs.

The Marimo framework facilitates the creation of these applications by providing a structure for organizing code into cells and managing the application's lifecycle. This allows for interactive and reactive execution of code, making it suitable for educational purposes, data exploration, and prototyping.

## Entry points

The directory contains multiple scripts, each serving as an entry point for a specific demonstration or functionality. The scripts are organized conceptually based on the type of operation they perform:

- **Altair Visualizations**: Scripts like `altair-0.py` to `altair-8.py` focus on creating various types of visualizations using the Altair library.
- **Pandas Data Manipulations**: Scripts like `pandas-0.py` to `pandas-25.py` demonstrate different data manipulation techniques using Pandas.
- **Query Parameters**: Scripts like `query-params-0.py` and `query-params-1.py` show how to handle query parameters in a Marimo application.

Each script is self-contained and can be run independently to explore the specific functionality it demonstrates. The Marimo framework's `App` class is used to manage the execution of cells within each script, providing a consistent structure across all scripts.
