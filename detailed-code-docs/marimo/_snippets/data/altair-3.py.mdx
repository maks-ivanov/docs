## High-level description
The target file is a script that uses the Marimo framework to create a simple application with multiple cells. It demonstrates how to create a stacked histogram using the Altair library, with data sourced from the Vega datasets. The script is structured to be run as a standalone application using Marimo's `app.run()` method.

## Code Structure
The script is organized into several cells, each defined by the `@app.cell` decorator. These cells are functions that perform specific tasks, such as rendering markdown content, loading datasets, and creating visualizations. The Marimo framework is used to manage the application lifecycle and cell execution.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to manage the lifecycle of the application. It provides the `@app.cell` decorator to define executable cells and the `app.run()` method to start the application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a cell within the Marimo application. Each cell can perform a specific task, such as rendering markdown or creating a visualization.

### `__`
#### Description
The `__` function is a placeholder name used for multiple cells in the script. Each instance of `__` serves a different purpose depending on the context of the cell.

#### Inputs
- For the first cell: `mo` (Marimo object) is used to render markdown content.
- For the second cell: No inputs are required.
- For the third cell: No inputs are required.

#### Outputs
- For the first cell: None.
- For the second cell: Returns the Altair chart object, the cars dataset, and the data module.
- For the third cell: Returns the Marimo module.

#### Internal Logic
- **First Cell**: Uses the `mo.md()` method to render a markdown string that describes the visualization.
- **Second Cell**: 
  - Imports the `data` module from `vega_datasets` to load the `cars` dataset.
  - Uses Altair to create a stacked histogram by encoding the `Miles_per_Gallon` field on the x-axis, counting occurrences on the y-axis, and using the `Origin` field for color encoding.
- **Third Cell**: Simply returns the Marimo module.

## References
- **Altair**: Used for creating the visualization.
- **Vega Datasets**: Provides the example dataset (`cars`) used in the visualization.

## Error Handling
The script does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the dataset and libraries are available and correctly configured.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose any API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
