## High-level description
The target file is a script that uses the Marimo framework to create a simple interactive visualization application. It demonstrates how to use Altair, a declarative statistical visualization library, to create a linked scatter plot and histogram. The scatter plot and histogram are linked through a selection interval, allowing users to explore relationships between data points interactively.

## Code Structure
The code is structured using the Marimo framework, which organizes the application into cells. Each cell is a function decorated with `@app.cell`, which allows the Marimo application to manage and execute these cells. The main components of the code include the setup of the Marimo application, the creation of a linked scatter plot and histogram using Altair, and the loading of an example dataset from the Vega datasets.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object for the Marimo framework. It manages the execution of the decorated cells and runs the application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. Each decorated function represents a cell that can contain code to be executed as part of the application.

### `__`
#### Description
The `__` function is a placeholder name used for multiple cells in the script. Each instance of `__` serves a different purpose depending on the context of the cell.

#### Inputs and Outputs
- The first `__` function takes `mo` (Marimo module) as input and outputs a markdown string to describe the visualization.
- The second `__` function does not take any inputs and outputs several objects related to the Altair visualization: `alt`, `cars`, `data`, `histogram`, `interval`, and `points`.
- The third `__` function imports the Marimo module and returns it.

#### Internal Logic
- The first `__` function uses the `mo.md` method to render a markdown description of the visualization.
- The second `__` function:
  - Loads the `cars` dataset from the Vega datasets.
  - Creates a selection interval using Altair.
  - Constructs a scatter plot (`points`) and a histogram (`histogram`) using Altair, linking them with the selection interval.
  - Returns the Altair objects and dataset for further use.
- The third `__` function simply imports and returns the Marimo module.

## Error Handling
The code does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the dataset loading and visualization creation will succeed without issues.

## Logging
The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application using the Marimo framework.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
