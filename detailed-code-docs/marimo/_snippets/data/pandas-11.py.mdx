## High-level description

The target file is a Python script that uses the `marimo` framework to create a simple application. It demonstrates how to extract values from a Pandas DataFrame column using a regular expression. The script defines a few cells using the `@app.cell` decorator, which are executed when the application runs. The main functionality is to showcase the use of regular expressions to extract parts of a string from a DataFrame column.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the `marimo` framework, which is used to define and run an application. The main components are the `@app.cell` decorated functions, which define the logic to be executed. The script imports the `pandas` library to create and manipulate a DataFrame, and it uses a regular expression to extract specific parts of a string from the DataFrame.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to define and run the application. It provides the `@app.cell` decorator to define executable cells within the application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a cell within the `marimo` application. Each cell can contain logic that is executed when the application runs.

### `__`
#### Description
This is a placeholder function name used for multiple cells in the script. Each `__` function is decorated with `@app.cell` and contains specific logic to be executed.

#### Inputs
- For the first cell: `mo` (an instance of `marimo`).
- For the second cell: No inputs.
- For the third cell: No inputs.

#### Outputs
- For the first cell: None.
- For the second cell: A tuple containing a DataFrame and the `pandas` module.
- For the third cell: A tuple containing the `marimo` module.

#### Internal Logic
- **First Cell**: Uses the `mo.md` method to render a markdown string that describes the purpose of the script.
- **Second Cell**: 
  - Imports the `pandas` library.
  - Creates a DataFrame with a single column named "request" containing HTTP request strings.
  - Uses the `str.extract` method with a regular expression to extract the path from the request strings.
  - Returns the DataFrame and the `pandas` module.
- **Third Cell**: Imports the `marimo` module and returns it.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Used to create and run the application, and to define executable cells. |
| `pandas`   | Used to create and manipulate a DataFrame, and to perform string extraction using regular expressions. |

## Error Handling

The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the operations (such as DataFrame creation and string extraction) will succeed without errors.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application using the `marimo` framework.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
