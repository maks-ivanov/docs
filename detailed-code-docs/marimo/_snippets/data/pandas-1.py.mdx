## High-level description

The target file is a Python script that uses the `marimo` library to create a reactive notebook application. It demonstrates how to use the `pandas` library to manipulate a DataFrame, specifically renaming multiple columns. The script is structured to run as a standalone application using `marimo.App`.

## Code Structure

The script is organized into several cells, each defined by the `@app.cell` decorator. These cells are executed in a reactive manner, meaning that changes in one cell can trigger updates in others. The main components include the creation and manipulation of a `pandas` DataFrame and the use of `marimo` for application management and markdown rendering.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which is used to manage the reactive notebook application. It orchestrates the execution of cells and handles the application's lifecycle.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell in the `marimo` application. Each cell can contain code that is executed as part of the application's reactive execution model.

### `__()`
#### Description
This function is defined multiple times with different logic in each cell. It serves as the main function for each cell, executing the code within the cell's context.

#### Inputs
- The first cell takes `mo` as an input, which is an instance of `marimo` used for rendering markdown.

#### Outputs
- The first cell outputs markdown content using `mo.md`.
- The second cell outputs a `pandas` DataFrame after renaming its columns.
- The third cell outputs the `marimo` module.

#### Internal Logic
- The first cell uses `mo.md` to render markdown content describing the purpose of the script.
- The second cell creates a `pandas` DataFrame, renames its columns using `df.rename`, and returns the modified DataFrame.
- The third cell imports `marimo` and returns it.

## Side Effects
- The second cell modifies the DataFrame in place by renaming its columns.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Used to create and manage the reactive notebook application. |
| `pandas` | Used for DataFrame manipulation, specifically renaming columns. |

## Error Handling
The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the operations (e.g., DataFrame creation and renaming) will succeed without exceptions.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose any API or public interface. It is designed to be run as a standalone application using `marimo`.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
