## High-level description

The target file is a Python script that uses the Marimo framework to create a web application for data visualization. It specifically demonstrates how to create a scatter plot with a rolling mean line using the Altair library, based on a dataset of car attributes. The script is structured to load data, create visualizations, and run the application.

## Code Structure

The script is organized into several cells, each defined by the `@app.cell` decorator from the Marimo framework. These cells encapsulate different parts of the application logic, such as documentation, data loading, visualization creation, and module imports. The main symbols in the code are the `app` object, which is an instance of `marimo.App`, and the functions decorated with `@app.cell`, which define the application's behavior.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object for the Marimo framework. It is used to define and run the web application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell in the Marimo application. Each cell can contain a function that performs a specific task, such as rendering markdown, loading data, or creating visualizations.

### `__`
#### Description
The `__` function is used multiple times in the script, each time serving a different purpose depending on the cell it is in. It is a placeholder function name used to define the logic within each cell.

#### Inputs
- For the first cell: `mo` (Marimo object for rendering markdown)
- For the second cell: None
- For the third cell: None

#### Outputs
- For the first cell: None
- For the second cell: Returns `alt`, `cars`, `data`, `lines`, `points`
- For the third cell: Returns `mo`

#### Internal Logic
- **First Cell**: Uses the Marimo object `mo` to render markdown documentation for the visualization.
- **Second Cell**: 
  - Loads the `cars` dataset from `vega_datasets`.
  - Creates a scatter plot (`points`) and a line plot (`lines`) using Altair, encoding the year and miles per gallon, and coloring by origin.
  - Combines the scatter and line plots.
  - Returns the Altair chart objects and data.
- **Third Cell**: Imports the Marimo module and returns it.

## Dependencies

| Dependency     | Purpose                                      |
|:---------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| `marimo`       | Framework for creating web applications.     |
| `vega_datasets`| Provides example datasets for visualization. |
| `altair`       | Library for declarative statistical visualization. |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the dataset and libraries are available and correctly configured.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface beyond the Marimo application cells.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
