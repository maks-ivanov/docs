## High-level description

The target file is a Python script that uses the Marimo framework to create a simple application. It demonstrates how to filter rows in a Pandas DataFrame based on a timestamp and a time delta string. The script defines a function to perform this filtering and uses Marimo's cell-based structure to organize the code.

## Code Structure

The script is structured using Marimo's `@app.cell` decorator, which allows the code to be organized into discrete cells. Each cell can contain a function or a block of code that is executed as part of the Marimo application. The main components of the script include the creation of a Pandas DataFrame, the definition of a filtering function, and the execution of the Marimo application.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
An instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to create and run the Marimo application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
A decorator provided by the Marimo framework that is used to define a cell in the application. Each cell can contain a function or a block of code that is executed as part of the application.

### `rows_in_time_range`
#### Description
A function that filters rows in a Pandas DataFrame based on a timestamp and a time delta string. It returns rows where the timestamp is within a specified range.

#### Inputs
| Name          | Type         | Description                                                                 |
|:--------------|:-------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| df            | DataFrame    | The Pandas DataFrame to filter.                                             |
| time_column   | str          | The name of the column containing timestamps.                               |
| start_ts_str  | str          | The starting timestamp as a string.                                         |
| timedelta_str | str          | A string representing the time delta (e.g., '2 minutes', '1 day 2 hours'). |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type      | Description                                      |
|:-----|:----------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| df   | DataFrame | A DataFrame containing rows within the time range.|

#### Internal Logic
1. Convert the `start_ts_str` to a Pandas `Timestamp` and localize it to the 'US/Pacific' timezone.
2. Calculate the end timestamp by adding the `timedelta_str` to the start timestamp.
3. Use the Pandas `query` method to filter the DataFrame for rows where the timestamp is within the specified range.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose                                                                 |
|:-----------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| marimo     | Used to create and run the application using the Marimo framework.      |
| pandas     | Used for data manipulation and analysis, specifically for handling DataFrames.|

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the inputs to the `rows_in_time_range` function are valid and correctly formatted.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application using the Marimo framework.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
