## High-level description
The target file is a script that uses the Marimo framework to create a simple application with cells that demonstrate the creation of a `pandas.Timedelta` object using keyword arguments. The script is structured to be run as a standalone application, and it includes markdown documentation within the application cells to explain the functionality.

## Code Structure
The script is structured using the Marimo framework, which organizes code into "cells" that can contain both code and markdown documentation. The main components are:
- The `marimo.App` instance, which serves as the application container.
- Several `@app.cell` decorated functions, which define individual cells in the application. These cells either display markdown content or execute code.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
An instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to create and manage the application. It serves as the main entry point for running the application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
A decorator provided by the Marimo framework that is used to define a cell within the application. Each decorated function represents a cell that can contain either code or markdown content.

### `__`
#### Description
A series of functions decorated with `@app.cell`, each representing a cell in the Marimo application. These functions either display markdown content or execute code related to creating a `pandas.Timedelta`.

#### Inputs
- For markdown cells: `mo` (an instance of Marimo's markdown object).
- For code cells: No explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
- For markdown cells: None.
- For code cells: Tuples containing imported modules (e.g., `(pd,)` or `(mo,)`).

#### Internal Logic
- The first two cells use the `mo.md` method to display markdown content explaining the purpose of the script and the available keyword arguments for creating a `pandas.Timedelta`.
- The third cell imports the `pandas` library and demonstrates the creation of a `pandas.Timedelta` object with a specified number of days.
- The fourth cell imports the `marimo` library and returns it as a tuple.

## References
- `pandas.Timedelta`: A class from the Pandas library used to represent a duration, the difference between two dates or times.
- `marimo.App`: A class from the Marimo framework used to create and manage applications.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Used to create and manage the application, and to display markdown content. |
| `pandas` | Used to create a `Timedelta` object, demonstrating the use of keyword arguments. |

## Error Handling
The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the necessary libraries are available and that the code will execute without errors.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application using the Marimo framework.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
