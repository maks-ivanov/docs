## High-level description
The target file is a script that uses the `marimo` framework to create a simple application that demonstrates how to transform a Pandas DataFrame by exploding a column containing dictionary values into multiple columns. The script defines several cells using the `@app.cell` decorator, which are executed as part of the application.

## Code Structure
The code is structured into several cells, each defined by the `@app.cell` decorator. These cells are executed in sequence when the application runs. The main functionality is achieved by creating a Pandas DataFrame with a column of dictionaries and then transforming this column into separate columns using Pandas operations.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to define and run the application. It manages the execution of the cells decorated with `@app.cell`.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell in the `marimo` application. Each cell can contain code that is executed when the application runs. In this script, cells are used to define markdown content and to perform data transformations.

### `__`
#### Description
The function `__` is used as a placeholder for each cell. It is defined multiple times with different logic in each cell. This is a common pattern in `marimo` applications to define multiple cells with minimal boilerplate.

#### Inputs
- For markdown cells: `mo` (an instance of `marimo` used to render markdown content).
- For the DataFrame transformation cell: No inputs are explicitly passed.

#### Outputs
- For markdown cells: None.
- For the DataFrame transformation cell: Returns the transformed DataFrame and the Pandas module.

#### Internal Logic
- **Markdown Cells**: Use the `mo.md()` method to render markdown content that describes the purpose of the code.
- **DataFrame Transformation Cell**: 
  1. Imports the Pandas library.
  2. Creates a DataFrame with a column named `dict` containing dictionary values.
  3. Uses `pd.concat()` and `df["dict"].apply(pd.Series)` to split the dictionary column into separate columns.
  4. Returns the transformed DataFrame and the Pandas module.

## References
- **Pandas**: The script uses the Pandas library to create and manipulate the DataFrame.
- **marimo**: The `marimo` framework is used to define and run the application, as well as to render markdown content.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Used to create and manage the application, and to render markdown content. |
| `pandas`   | Used to create and manipulate the DataFrame. |

## Error Handling
The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the DataFrame operations will succeed without errors.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose any API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application using the `marimo` framework.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
