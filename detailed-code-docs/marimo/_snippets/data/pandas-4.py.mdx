## High-level description

The target file is a script that demonstrates how to use a variable to dynamically specify a column name in a Pandas DataFrame query. It uses the `marimo` library to structure the code into cells, which are likely intended for interactive execution. The script creates a simple DataFrame and performs a query using a variable to specify the column name.

## Code Structure

The script is structured using the `marimo` library, which organizes the code into cells. Each cell is defined using the `@app.cell` decorator, and the cells are executed in sequence. The script includes markdown documentation cells and code cells that perform operations on a Pandas DataFrame.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to manage the execution of the script's cells. It provides the `@app.cell` decorator to define cells and the `app.run()` method to execute them.

### `__`
#### Description
The `__` function is used multiple times in the script, each time serving a different purpose. It is decorated with `@app.cell`, indicating that it is a cell in the `marimo` application. Each instance of `__` either contains markdown documentation or code to be executed.

#### Inputs
- For markdown cells: `mo` (an instance of `marimo` used to render markdown).
- For code cells: No inputs are explicitly defined.

#### Outputs
- For markdown cells: None.
- For code cells: Various outputs depending on the cell, such as a tuple containing the column name, DataFrame, and Pandas module.

#### Internal Logic
- The first two instances of `__` are used to render markdown documentation using `mo.md()`.
- The third instance of `__` imports Pandas, creates a DataFrame, and performs a query using a variable to specify the column name. It returns the column name, DataFrame, and Pandas module.
- The fourth instance of `__` imports the `marimo` module and returns it.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Used to structure the script into interactive cells and manage their execution. |
| `pandas`   | Used to create and manipulate the DataFrame for querying. |

## Error Handling

The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the operations, such as DataFrame creation and querying, will succeed without errors.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone script using the `marimo` framework.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
