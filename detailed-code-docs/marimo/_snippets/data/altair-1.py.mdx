## High-level description

The target file is a Python script that uses the Marimo framework to create a simple interactive notebook-like application. It demonstrates how to create a bar plot using the Altair library, visualizing the mean miles per gallon for different car origins from a sample dataset. The script is structured to run as a standalone application using Marimo's `App` class.

## Code Structure

The script is structured around the Marimo framework, which uses the concept of "cells" to encapsulate different parts of the application. Each cell is a function decorated with `@app.cell`, and these cells are executed in sequence when the application runs. The script imports necessary libraries, loads a dataset, creates a visualization, and then runs the application.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object. It manages the execution of the decorated cell functions and provides the infrastructure for running the application as a standalone script.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell in the Marimo application. Each decorated function represents a cell that can contain code to be executed as part of the application. The cells are executed in the order they are defined in the script.

### `__`
#### Description
The `__` function is a placeholder name used for multiple cell functions in the script. Each instance of `__` serves a different purpose, such as rendering markdown, loading data, or creating a plot.

#### Inputs
- For the first `__`: `mo` (Marimo object) is used to render markdown content.
- For the second `__`: No inputs are explicitly passed; it loads data and creates a plot.
- For the third `__`: No inputs are explicitly passed; it imports the Marimo module.

#### Outputs
- For the first `__`: None, it only renders markdown.
- For the second `__`: Returns the Altair chart object, the cars dataset, and the data module.
- For the third `__`: Returns the Marimo module.

#### Internal Logic
- The first `__` function uses the `mo.md` method to render markdown content that describes the visualization.
- The second `__` function loads a dataset using `vega_datasets`, creates a bar plot using Altair, and returns the relevant objects.
- The third `__` function simply imports and returns the Marimo module.

## References

- `marimo.App`: The main application class from the Marimo framework.
- `vega_datasets.data`: A module used to load example datasets.
- `altair`: A library used for creating the bar plot visualization.

## Dependencies

| Dependency     | Purpose                                           |
|:---------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| `marimo`       | Provides the framework for creating the application. |
| `vega_datasets`| Supplies example datasets for visualization.      |
| `altair`       | Used to create the bar plot visualization.        |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the dataset loading and plotting operations will succeed without exceptions.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is designed to be run as a standalone application using the Marimo framework.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
