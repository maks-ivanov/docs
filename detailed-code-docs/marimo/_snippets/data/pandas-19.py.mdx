## High-level description

The target file is a script that uses the Marimo framework to create a simple application with a focus on demonstrating how to manipulate a Pandas DataFrame by ignoring a specific column. The script defines a few cells using the Marimo framework, which are executed to perform specific tasks, such as creating a DataFrame and returning it with a specific column ignored.

## Code Structure

The script is structured using the Marimo framework, which allows defining "cells" that encapsulate specific pieces of functionality. Each cell is a function decorated with `@app.cell`, and these cells are executed when the application runs. The main symbols in the code are the Marimo application instance (`app`) and the cells defined within it.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to define and run the application. It serves as the main entry point for the Marimo application and manages the execution of the defined cells.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. Each decorated function represents a cell that can perform specific tasks when the application is run.

### `__()`
#### Description
This is a placeholder function name used for multiple cells in the script. Each occurrence of `__()` serves a different purpose depending on the context in which it is defined.

#### Inputs
- The first cell takes `mo` (Marimo module) as an input.
- The second cell has no inputs.
- The third cell imports `marimo` as `mo` but does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
- The first cell outputs nothing.
- The second cell outputs a tuple containing a Pandas DataFrame and the Pandas module.
- The third cell outputs a tuple containing the Marimo module.

#### Internal Logic
- The first cell uses the `mo.md()` function to render a markdown string that serves as a title or description for the application.
- The second cell creates a Pandas DataFrame with two columns, "first_name" and "last_name", and then returns the DataFrame with the "last_name" column ignored.
- The third cell simply returns the Marimo module.

## Side Effects

- The script imports the Pandas library and the Marimo framework, which are used within the cells.
- The script creates a Pandas DataFrame and manipulates it by ignoring a specific column.
