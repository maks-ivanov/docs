## High-level description

The target file is a script that uses the Marimo framework to create a simple application that demonstrates how to create a histogram using the Altair visualization library. It loads a dataset of cars, plots a histogram of the "Miles_per_Gallon" attribute, and returns the Altair chart object along with the dataset.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the Marimo framework, which uses the concept of "cells" to define different parts of the application. Each cell is a function decorated with `@app.cell`, and these cells are executed in sequence when the application runs. The script imports necessary libraries, loads a dataset, creates a visualization, and returns relevant objects.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to define and run the application. It serves as the main entry point for the Marimo application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell in the Marimo application. Each decorated function represents a cell that can contain logic for data processing, visualization, or other operations.

### `__()`
#### Description
This is a placeholder function name used for multiple cells in the script. Each instance of `__()` serves a different purpose depending on its content.

#### Inputs
- For the first cell: `mo` (Marimo module)
- For the second cell: None
- For the third cell: None

#### Outputs
- For the first cell: None
- For the second cell: Tuple containing Altair chart object, cars dataset, and data module
- For the third cell: Tuple containing the Marimo module

#### Internal Logic
- The first cell uses the Marimo module to render markdown text describing the visualization.
- The second cell loads a dataset using `vega_datasets`, creates a histogram using Altair, and returns the chart and dataset.
- The third cell imports the Marimo module and returns it.

| Dependency     | Purpose                                                                 |
|:---------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `marimo`       | Framework used to define and run the application.                       |
| `vega_datasets`| Provides example datasets for use with visualization libraries.         |
| `altair`       | Visualization library used to create the histogram.                     |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the dataset loading and visualization creation will succeed without issues.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application using the Marimo framework.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
