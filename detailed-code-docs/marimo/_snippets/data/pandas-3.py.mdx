## High-level description

The target file is a Python script that uses the `marimo` library to create a reactive notebook or app. It demonstrates how to query a Pandas DataFrame using a variable value. The script sets up a simple DataFrame, performs a query operation, and integrates with the `marimo` framework to display markdown content.

## Code Structure

The script is structured around the `marimo` library's `App` class, which is used to define cells that can contain code or markdown. Each cell is defined using the `@app.cell` decorator, and the script includes several cells that either display markdown or execute code. The main symbols in the code are the `marimo.App` instance and the `@app.cell` decorator, which are used to organize and execute the code within the app.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to create a reactive notebook or app. It serves as the main entry point for defining and running the app.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
The `app` instance is used to define cells using the `@app.cell` decorator. Each cell can contain code or markdown that is executed or displayed when the app runs.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the `marimo` app. Each cell can contain code or markdown that is executed or displayed as part of the app.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | `marimo` module | Used to render markdown content within the cell. |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
The decorator is applied to functions that define the content of each cell. The content can be markdown, which is rendered using the `mo.md` method, or code that is executed when the app runs.

### `__()`
#### Description
The `__()` function is used as a placeholder for cells defined with the `@app.cell` decorator. It contains the logic or markdown content for each cell.

#### Inputs
Varies depending on the cell content. For markdown cells, it takes the `mo` parameter to render markdown.

#### Outputs
Varies depending on the cell content. For markdown cells, it returns nothing. For code cells, it returns the results of the executed code.

#### Internal Logic
- For markdown cells, the function uses `mo.md` to render markdown content.
- For code cells, it executes the code and returns the results, such as a DataFrame and a variable.

## References

- `marimo.App`: Used to create the app and define cells.
- `pandas.DataFrame`: Used to create and manipulate the DataFrame within the code cell.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Used to create reactive notebooks and apps. |
| `pandas` | Used for data manipulation and analysis. |

## Error Handling

The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the operations, such as DataFrame creation and querying, will succeed without errors.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone script using the `marimo` framework.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
