## High-level description
The target file is a script that uses the Marimo framework to create a simple application for visualizing time series data using Altair. It demonstrates how to create a line plot of stock prices over time, leveraging Altair's native support for temporal data types.

## Code Structure
The script is structured using the Marimo framework, which organizes code into cells. Each cell is a function decorated with `@app.cell`, indicating that it is a part of the Marimo application. The script imports necessary libraries, defines cells for markdown documentation and data visualization, and finally runs the application.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object for the Marimo framework. It is used to define and run the application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a cell within the Marimo application. Each cell can contain code that performs a specific task, such as rendering markdown or creating visualizations.

### `__`
#### Description
The `__` function is used multiple times in the script, each time serving a different purpose depending on the context. It is a placeholder name for functions that are decorated with `@app.cell`.

#### Inputs
- For the first `__` function: `mo` (Marimo object) is passed implicitly by the framework.
- For the second `__` function: No explicit inputs.
- For the third `__` function: No explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
- For the first `__` function: None.
- For the second `__` function: Returns the `alt`, `data`, and `stocks` objects.
- For the third `__` function: Returns the `mo` object.

#### Internal Logic
- The first `__` function uses the `mo.md` method to render markdown documentation about the visualization.
- The second `__` function imports data from the `vega_datasets` library, creates a line chart using Altair, and encodes the data with temporal and quantitative fields.
- The third `__` function simply imports and returns the `marimo` module.

### `if __name__ == "__main__":`
#### Description
This conditional statement checks if the script is being run as the main program and, if so, calls `app.run()` to execute the Marimo application.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Used to create and run the application framework. |
| `vega_datasets` | Provides example datasets for visualization. |
| `altair` | Used for creating the line plot visualization. |

## Error Handling
The script does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the data and libraries are available and correctly configured.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
