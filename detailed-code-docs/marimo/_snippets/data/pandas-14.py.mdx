## High-level description
The target file is a script that uses the Marimo framework to create a notebook-like application. It demonstrates how to use the Pandas library to create a `TimeDelta` object with a specified unit. The script is structured into cells, each performing a specific task, such as rendering markdown or executing code.

## Code Structure
The script is organized into several cells using the Marimo framework. Each cell is defined as a function decorated with `@app.cell`, which allows the function to be executed as part of the Marimo application. The cells are used to render markdown content and execute Python code, specifically focusing on the Pandas library's `to_timedelta` function.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to create and manage the notebook-like application. It serves as the main entry point for defining and running the application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a cell in the Marimo application. Each decorated function represents a cell that can contain markdown content or executable code.

### `__`
#### Description
The `__` function is used multiple times in the script, each time serving a different purpose depending on the context. It is a placeholder name for functions that are decorated with `@app.cell`.

#### Inputs
- For markdown cells: `mo` (an instance of Marimo's markdown rendering object).
- For code execution cells: No inputs are required.

#### Outputs
- For markdown cells: None.
- For code execution cells: Returns a tuple containing the imported modules (e.g., `pd` for Pandas, `mo` for Marimo).

#### Internal Logic
- Markdown cells use the `mo.md()` method to render markdown content.
- Code execution cells import necessary libraries and execute specific code, such as creating a `TimeDelta` object using Pandas.

## References
- `marimo.App`: Used to create the application instance.
- `pd.to_timedelta`: A Pandas function used to create a `TimeDelta` object with a specified unit.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Used to create and manage the notebook-like application. |
| pandas | Used to demonstrate the creation of a `TimeDelta` object. |

## Error Handling
The script does not implement specific error handling mechanisms beyond basic exception raising. It assumes that the necessary libraries are installed and available.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application using the Marimo framework.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
