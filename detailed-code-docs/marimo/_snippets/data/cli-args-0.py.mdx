## High-level description
The target file is a script that demonstrates how to read command-line arguments in a Marimo application. It uses the `marimo` library to create an application and defines cells that explain and retrieve command-line arguments passed to the script when executed.

## Code Structure
The script is structured using the `marimo` library, which allows the creation of applications with cells that can contain code or markdown. The main components are:
- The `marimo.App` instance, which serves as the application container.
- Decorated functions with `@app.cell`, which define the content and behavior of each cell in the application.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which is used to define and run a Marimo application. It acts as a container for the application logic and cells.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. Each decorated function represents a cell that can contain code or markdown content.

### `__(mo)`
#### Description
This function is a cell that uses the `mo.md` method to display markdown content explaining how to use command-line arguments with Marimo. It provides an example of how to run the application with arguments.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | object | An instance of the Marimo object, used to access Marimo-specific methods like `md` for markdown rendering. |

#### Outputs
None

### `__(mo)`
#### Description
This function is a cell that retrieves command-line arguments using the `mo.cli_args()` method and returns them. It demonstrates how to access these arguments within a Marimo application.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | object | An instance of the Marimo object, used to access Marimo-specific methods like `cli_args` for retrieving command-line arguments. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params | tuple | A tuple containing the command-line arguments passed to the application. |

### `__()`
#### Description
This function is a cell that imports the `marimo` library and returns it. It serves as a utility cell to ensure the `marimo` library is available for use in other cells.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The imported `marimo` module. |

## Error Handling
The script does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the `marimo` library functions will execute without exceptions.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose an API or public interface beyond the command-line execution.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
