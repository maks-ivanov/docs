## High-level description

The target file `altair-5.py` is a script that demonstrates how to create an interactive visualization using the Altair library within a Marimo application. It specifically showcases how to implement interactive brushing on a scatter plot, allowing users to select data points by clicking and dragging over them.

## Code Structure

The script is structured using the Marimo framework, which organizes code into cells that can be executed independently. The main components include the initialization of a Marimo application, the creation of a scatter plot using Altair, and the implementation of interactive brushing functionality. The script also imports necessary datasets and libraries to facilitate the visualization.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object for the Marimo framework. It is used to define and run the application, organizing the code into executable cells.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. Each cell can contain a function that performs a specific task, such as rendering a visualization or processing data. Cells are executed independently and can return values to be used by other cells.

### `__generated_with`
#### Description
This variable indicates the version of the tool or framework used to generate the script. In this case, it is set to "0.3.9".

### `__()`
#### Description
The `__()` function is a placeholder function used within cells. It is defined multiple times with different purposes, such as rendering markdown content, loading datasets, and creating visualizations.

#### Inputs
- For the first `__()` function: `mo` (Marimo object for rendering markdown).
- For the second `__()` function: None.
- For the third `__()` function: None.

#### Outputs
- For the first `__()` function: None.
- For the second `__()` function: Returns the Altair library, the cars dataset, the data module, and the interval selection object.
- For the third `__()` function: Returns the Marimo module.

#### Internal Logic
- The first `__()` function uses the `mo.md()` method to render markdown content describing the visualization.
- The second `__()` function loads the cars dataset from the Vega datasets, creates an Altair selection interval, and constructs a scatter plot with interactive brushing.
- The third `__()` function imports the Marimo module and returns it.

## References

- `marimo.App`: Used to create the main application object.
- `vega_datasets.data`: Used to load example datasets for visualization.
- `altair`: Used to create and configure the interactive scatter plot.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Provides the framework for creating reactive notebooks and applications. |
| `vega_datasets` | Supplies example datasets for visualization. |
| `altair` | Used for creating declarative statistical visualizations. |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors beyond the basic functionality provided by the imported libraries. Any errors related to data loading or visualization would need to be managed by the user or within the Marimo framework.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms. Any logging would need to be added by the user if required.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone script within the Marimo framework to demonstrate interactive visualization capabilities.
