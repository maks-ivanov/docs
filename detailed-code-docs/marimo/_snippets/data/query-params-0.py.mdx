## High-level description
The target file is a Python script that uses the `marimo` library to create a simple application that demonstrates how to read query parameters in a notebook environment. The script defines a few cells using the `@app.cell` decorator, which are executed when the application runs. The main functionality is to access and print query parameters passed to the notebook.

## Code Structure
The script is structured around the `marimo` library, which is used to create an application (`app`) and define executable cells within that application. Each cell is defined using the `@app.cell` decorator, and the cells are executed in sequence when the application runs. The script includes three main cells: one for displaying markdown content, one for accessing and printing query parameters, and one for importing the `marimo` library.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to define and run a notebook application. It serves as the main entry point for the application and manages the execution of the defined cells.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the `marimo` application. Each decorated function represents a cell that can contain code to be executed when the application runs.

### `__(mo)`
#### Description
This function is a cell that uses the `mo.md` method to display markdown content explaining how to read query parameters using `mo.query_params`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | object | An instance of the `marimo` library, providing methods for interacting with the notebook environment. |

#### Outputs
None

### `__(mo)`
#### Description
This function is a cell that retrieves and prints the query parameters using the `mo.query_params` method.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | object | An instance of the `marimo` library, providing methods for interacting with the notebook environment. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params | dict | A dictionary containing the query parameters passed to the notebook. |

### `__()`
#### Description
This function is a cell that imports the `marimo` library and returns it. It ensures that the `marimo` library is available for use in the notebook environment.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The `marimo` library module. |

## Side Effects
- The script prints the query parameters to the console when the application runs.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Used to create and manage the notebook application and its cells. |

## Error Handling
The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the `marimo` library functions will execute without errors.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms. It relies on standard output for displaying information.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application within a notebook environment.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
