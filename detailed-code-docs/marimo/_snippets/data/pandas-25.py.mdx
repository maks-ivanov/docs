## High-level description

The target file is a Python script that demonstrates how to use the Pandas library to group timestamped data into intervals of arbitrary duration using a `Grouper` object. It is structured as a Marimo application, which is a framework for creating interactive Python notebooks. The script includes markdown documentation and a code example that shows how to group data by a specified frequency.

## Code Structure

The script is structured as a Marimo application with multiple cells, each defined by the `@app.cell` decorator. These cells include markdown documentation and a code example. The main components are:

- **Marimo Application (`app`)**: The script uses the Marimo framework to create an interactive notebook-like environment.
- **Markdown Cells**: These cells provide documentation and explanations for the code example.
- **Code Cell**: This cell contains the actual Python code that demonstrates the use of Pandas for grouping timestamped data.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to create an interactive application. It manages the execution of the cells and the rendering of outputs.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell in the Marimo application. Each cell can contain code or markdown, and they are executed in the order they are defined.

### `__()`
#### Description
The `__()` function is used as a placeholder for each cell. It is defined multiple times with different content, either markdown or code.

#### Inputs
- For markdown cells: `mo` (Marimo object for rendering markdown)
- For the code cell: None

#### Outputs
- For markdown cells: None
- For the code cell: A tuple containing the DataFrame and the Pandas module

#### Internal Logic
- **Markdown Cells**: Use the `mo.md()` method to render markdown content.
- **Code Cell**: 
  - Imports the Pandas library.
  - Creates a DataFrame with timestamped data.
  - Converts the 'time' column to datetime format.
  - Groups the data by 2-minute intervals using `pd.Grouper` and calculates the sum of requests for each interval.

## References

- **Pandas Library**: The script uses Pandas for data manipulation and grouping.
- **Marimo Framework**: The script is structured as a Marimo application, which is used for creating interactive notebooks.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Used to create an interactive application with cells for code and markdown. |
| `pandas`   | Used for data manipulation and grouping timestamped data. |

## Error Handling

The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the data and operations will execute without errors.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone script within the Marimo framework.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
