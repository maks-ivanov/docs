## High-level description

The code in `marimo/_snippets/data/query-params-1.py` is a script for a Marimo application that demonstrates how to use query parameters to maintain state in a URL. This is particularly useful for bookmarking or sharing a specific state of a notebook when it is run as an application. The script includes UI elements like sliders and text inputs that interact with the query parameters to dynamically update and reflect changes in the URL.

## Code Structure

The script is structured using Marimo's reactive programming model, where each function decorated with `@app.cell` represents a cell in a notebook. These cells are executed in a sequence that maintains the state and updates the UI elements based on query parameters. The main components include the initialization of the Marimo app, the definition of UI elements, and the interaction with query parameters.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which serves as the main application object for the Marimo notebook. It manages the execution of cells and the overall application lifecycle.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell in the Marimo notebook. Each decorated function represents a cell that can contain code to be executed, markdown for documentation, or UI elements.

### `__(mo)`
#### Description
This is a placeholder function name used multiple times in the script to define different cells. Each instance of `__(mo)` serves a different purpose, such as rendering markdown, initializing UI elements, or interacting with query parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | object | An instance of the Marimo object, providing methods for UI and query parameter interactions. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | tuple | The output varies by cell, typically returning UI elements or query parameters. |

#### Internal Logic
- The first cell renders markdown documentation explaining the use of query parameters.
- The second cell retrieves the current query parameters using `mo.query_params()`.
- The third cell creates a slider UI element, initializing its value from the query parameters and updating the parameters on change.
- The fourth cell creates a text input UI element, similarly interacting with query parameters.
- The final cell imports the Marimo module, ensuring it is available for use in the notebook.

## Side Effects

- The script modifies the URL's query parameters based on user interactions with the UI elements, allowing the state to be shared or bookmarked.
- UI elements are dynamically updated based on the current state of the query parameters.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Provides the framework for creating reactive notebooks and managing UI elements and query parameters. |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors. It relies on Marimo's framework to manage any exceptions that may occur during the execution of cells or interactions with UI elements.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms. It is assumed that Marimo's framework handles any necessary logging or debugging information.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API but provides an interface through the Marimo application, allowing users to interact with UI elements and query parameters.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
