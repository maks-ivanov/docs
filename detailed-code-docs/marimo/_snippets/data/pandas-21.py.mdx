## High-level description

The target file is a script that uses the `marimo` framework to create a simple application demonstrating how to manipulate and compare two Pandas DataFrames. Specifically, it shows how to select all rows from one DataFrame that are not present in another DataFrame based on their index. The script is structured to run as a `marimo` application, with cells that define different parts of the logic.

## Code Structure

The script is structured using the `marimo` framework, which organizes code into "cells" that can be executed independently. The main components of the script include:

- **`marimo.App`**: An instance of the `marimo` application, which manages the execution of the cells.
- **Cells**: Decorated functions that contain the logic for the application. Each cell can import modules, define data, and perform operations.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to manage the execution of the application. It is responsible for running the defined cells and orchestrating the flow of the application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the `marimo` application. Each decorated function represents a cell that can be executed independently. The cells in this script perform various tasks such as importing modules, defining DataFrames, and performing DataFrame operations.

### `__()`
#### Description
The `__()` function is a placeholder name used for multiple cells in the script. Each instance of this function performs a specific task within the application.

#### Internal Logic
- The first cell uses `mo.md` to render a markdown description of the task being performed.
- The second cell imports Pandas, creates two DataFrames (`terminator_df` and `buckaroo_df`), sets their indices, and performs an operation to find rows in `terminator_df` that are not in `buckaroo_df`.
- The third cell imports the `marimo` module and returns it.

## References

- **Pandas**: The script uses the Pandas library to create and manipulate DataFrames.
- **marimo**: The script uses the `marimo` framework to structure the application and manage cell execution.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Used to create and manage the application structure and execution. |
| `pandas`   | Used for creating and manipulating DataFrames. |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the DataFrames are correctly defined and that the operations will succeed without exceptions.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms. It focuses on demonstrating DataFrame operations within the `marimo` framework.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone `marimo` application.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
