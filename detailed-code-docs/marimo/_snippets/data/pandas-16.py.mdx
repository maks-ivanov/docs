## High-level description

The target file is a script that uses the `marimo` library to create a simple application with cells that demonstrate the use of the `pandas` library to create a `Timedelta` object from a string. The script is structured to be run as a standalone application, with the main functionality being the demonstration of creating a `Timedelta` object.

## Code Structure

The script is structured around the `marimo.App` class, which is used to create an application with multiple cells. Each cell is defined using the `@app.cell` decorator, and the cells contain different pieces of functionality. The first cell provides a markdown description, the second cell demonstrates the creation of a `Timedelta` object using `pandas`, and the third cell imports the `marimo` library.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to create and manage the application. It is the main object around which the script is structured.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the `marimo` application. Each decorated function represents a cell that can contain code to be executed as part of the application.

### `__()`
#### Description
There are three functions named `__()` in the script, each decorated with `@app.cell`. These functions define the content and behavior of the cells in the `marimo` application.

#### Inputs
- The first `__()` function takes `mo` as an input, which is an instance of the `marimo` library.
- The second and third `__()` functions do not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
- The first `__()` function does not return any output.
- The second `__()` function returns a tuple containing the `pandas` module.
- The third `__()` function returns a tuple containing the `marimo` module.

#### Internal Logic
- The first `__()` function uses the `mo.md()` method to display a markdown string describing the purpose of the script.
- The second `__()` function imports `pandas` and creates a `Timedelta` object using a string representation of a time duration.
- The third `__()` function imports the `marimo` library and returns it.

## References

- The `pandas` library is used in the second cell to create a `Timedelta` object.
- The `marimo` library is used throughout the script to create the application and manage its cells.

| `pandas`   | Used to create a `Timedelta` object from a string. |

## Error Handling

The script does not include any specific error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the necessary libraries are available and that the operations will succeed without errors.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose any API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application.

## TODOs
