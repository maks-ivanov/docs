## High-level description
The target file is a script that demonstrates how to use the Pandas library to filter rows in a DataFrame based on an attribute of a column's values. It uses the `marimo` library to structure the code into cells, which are likely intended for interactive or educational purposes. The script specifically shows how to filter rows by the length of the values in a column.

## Code Structure
The script is structured using the `marimo` library, which organizes the code into cells. Each cell is defined using the `@app.cell` decorator, and the cells contain either markdown documentation or executable Python code. The script uses Pandas to create a DataFrame and demonstrates filtering operations on it.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to manage the execution of the script's cells. It organizes the code into discrete units that can be executed independently.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the `marimo` application. Each cell can contain either markdown content or executable code. The decorator allows the script to be structured in a modular way, facilitating interactive execution.

### `__`
#### Description
The function `__` is used multiple times in the script, each time serving a different purpose depending on the context. It is a placeholder function name used to define cells with the `@app.cell` decorator.

#### Inputs
- For markdown cells: `mo` (an instance of `marimo` used to render markdown content).
- For code cells: No explicit inputs are provided.

#### Outputs
- For markdown cells: None.
- For code cells: Returns the result of the executed code, such as a DataFrame or imported modules.

#### Internal Logic
- Markdown cells use the `mo.md()` method to render markdown content.
- Code cells execute Python code, such as importing libraries, creating a DataFrame, and filtering it using Pandas.

### `df`
#### Description
`df` is a Pandas DataFrame created within one of the cells. It contains two columns, `first_name` and `last_name`, with sample data.

#### Internal Logic
The DataFrame is filtered using the `map()` method on the `last_name` column to select rows where the length of the last name is 5.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `pandas` | Used for creating and manipulating DataFrames. |
| `marimo` | Used to structure the script into cells and render markdown content. |

## Error Handling
The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the operations on the DataFrame and the use of the `marimo` library will succeed without errors.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone script using the `marimo` framework.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
