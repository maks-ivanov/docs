## High-level description
The target file is a script that uses the Marimo framework to create a simple application with cells that demonstrate the use of Pandas for querying a DataFrame using regular expressions. It defines a few cells that set up a DataFrame, perform a query using a regular expression, and return the results.

## Code Structure
The code is structured around the Marimo framework, which uses the concept of "cells" to encapsulate different parts of the application. Each cell is a function decorated with `@app.cell`, and these cells are executed as part of the Marimo application. The script defines three cells: one for markdown documentation, one for creating and querying a DataFrame, and one for importing the Marimo module.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to define and run the Marimo application. It serves as the main entry point for the application and manages the execution of the defined cells.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. Each decorated function represents a cell that can contain code to be executed as part of the application.

### `__()`
#### Description
This is a placeholder function name used for each cell. Each function is decorated with `@app.cell` and contains specific logic for that cell.

#### Inputs
- For the first cell: `mo` (Marimo object for markdown rendering)
- For the second cell: None
- For the third cell: None

#### Outputs
- For the first cell: None
- For the second cell: A tuple containing a DataFrame and the Pandas module
- For the third cell: A tuple containing the Marimo module

#### Internal Logic
- **First Cell**: Uses the Marimo object `mo` to render markdown documentation about querying a Pandas DataFrame using regular expressions.
- **Second Cell**: 
  - Imports the Pandas library.
  - Creates a DataFrame with first and last names.
  - Performs a query on the DataFrame using a regular expression to match last names containing "onno".
  - Returns the DataFrame and the Pandas module.
- **Third Cell**: Imports the Marimo module and returns it.

## Side Effects
- The first cell renders markdown content using the Marimo framework.
- The second cell performs a query on a DataFrame but does not modify any external state.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Used to create and manage the application and its cells. |
| pandas | Used for creating and querying the DataFrame. |

## Error Handling
The code does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the operations (such as DataFrame creation and querying) will succeed without exceptions.

## Logging
The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application using the Marimo framework.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
