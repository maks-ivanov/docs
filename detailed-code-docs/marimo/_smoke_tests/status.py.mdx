## High-level description

The target file `marimo/_smoke_tests/status.py` is a script designed to test the functionality of the `marimo` library, specifically focusing on UI components related to status indicators such as progress bars and spinners. It demonstrates how to create and manipulate these UI elements, including setting sleep times, updating progress, and displaying additional information like estimated time of arrival (ETA) and rate.

## Code Structure

The script is structured using the `marimo` library's `App` and `cell` constructs. Each `@app.cell` decorator defines a separate cell of code that can be executed independently. The script uses these cells to import necessary modules, create UI components, and demonstrate their functionality. The cells are interconnected, with some cells passing data to others, such as the sleep time value.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which serves as the main application object for the script. It manages the execution of the cells and the overall application lifecycle.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell of code that can be executed as part of the `marimo` application. Each cell can import modules, define variables, and perform operations. The cells in this script demonstrate various UI components and their functionalities.

### `__()`
#### Description
The `__()` function is a placeholder for each cell's logic. Each cell has a unique `__()` function that performs specific tasks, such as importing modules, creating UI components, or demonstrating progress bars and spinners.

#### Inputs and Outputs
The inputs and outputs of each `__()` function vary depending on the cell's purpose. For example, some cells take UI components as inputs and return updated values, while others perform operations without returning any values.

#### Internal Logic
- **Importing Modules**: Some cells import necessary modules like `marimo` and `time`.
- **UI Components**: Cells create UI components such as radio buttons, progress bars, and spinners using the `marimo` library.
- **Progress Bars**: Demonstrates the use of progress bars with different configurations, including titles, subtitles, ETA, and rate.
- **Spinners**: Demonstrates the use of spinners with updates and removal on exit.
- **Sleep Time**: Uses the `time.sleep()` function to simulate delays and demonstrate the progress of UI components.

## Side Effects

- The script modifies the UI by creating and updating components like progress bars and spinners.
- It uses the `time.sleep()` function to introduce delays, which affects the execution time of the script.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Provides the UI components and application framework used in the script. |
| `time`     | Used to introduce delays in the execution of the script. |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the `marimo` library functions and the `time.sleep()` function will execute without exceptions.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms. It focuses on demonstrating UI components rather than logging execution details.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose any API or public interface. It is a standalone script intended for testing and demonstration purposes.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code. The script appears to be complete and functional for its intended purpose.
