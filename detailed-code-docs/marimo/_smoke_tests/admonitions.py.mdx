## High-level description

The target file `marimo/_smoke_tests/admonitions.py` is a script designed to test the rendering of various types of admonition boxes using the Marimo framework. It defines a series of cells within a Marimo application that create and display different types of admonitions, such as "info", "warning", and "error", using Markdown syntax. The script is structured to run as a standalone application, showcasing the different admonition styles available in Marimo.

## Code Structure

The script is structured around the `marimo.App` class, which is used to define a series of cells. Each cell is a function decorated with `@app.cell`, and these cells are executed in sequence when the application runs. The main components of the script include:

- Initialization of a Marimo application instance.
- Definition of a list of admonition types.
- Creation of Markdown content for each admonition type.
- Rendering of the admonitions using Marimo's Markdown capabilities.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object for defining and running the Marimo application. It is used to register cells that contain the logic for rendering admonitions.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a cell within the Marimo application. Each cell represents a unit of work that can be executed by the application. In this script, cells are used to import modules, define admonition types, and render Markdown content.

### `create`
#### Description
The `create` function is defined within a cell and is responsible for generating Markdown content for a given type of admonition. It uses a raw string format to insert the admonition type into a predefined Markdown template.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| kind | str | The type of admonition to create (e.g., "info", "warning"). |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | str | A formatted Markdown string representing the admonition. |

#### Internal Logic
The function constructs a Markdown string using a raw string format (`rf""`) that includes the admonition type in both the title and the content of the admonition box.

## Side Effects

- The script modifies the state of the Marimo application by adding cells that define and render Markdown content.
- It outputs Markdown content to the application's UI, which is rendered as part of the application's execution.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Provides the framework for creating and running the application, as well as utilities for rendering Markdown content. |

## Error Handling

The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It relies on the Marimo framework to manage any errors that occur during the execution of the cells.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms. It is primarily focused on rendering UI components rather than tracking execution details.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application to demonstrate the rendering of admonitions.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code. The script appears to be complete and functional for its intended purpose.
