## High-level description

The target file `marimo/_smoke_tests/stop.py` is a script designed to perform a series of validation checks on a user-provided password using the Marimo framework. It sequentially validates the password against specific criteria, such as length and character content, and provides feedback to the user through the Marimo UI. If all validations pass, it confirms the password's correctness.

## Code Structure

The script is structured using the Marimo framework's `@app.cell` decorator, which defines discrete units of functionality, or "cells," that are executed in sequence. Each cell performs a specific task, such as importing modules, collecting user input, or validating the password. The cells are interconnected, with later cells depending on the outputs of earlier ones.

## Symbols

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a cell within the Marimo application. Each cell represents a step in the application's execution, and they are executed in the order they are defined.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The Marimo module, used for UI and control flow operations. |
| secret | object | The user-provided password input. |
| success_1 | bool | Result of the first validation check. |
| success_2 | bool | Result of the second validation check. |
| success_3 | bool | Result of the third validation check. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| secret | object | The user-provided password input. |
| success_1 | bool | Result of the first validation check. |
| success_2 | bool | Result of the second validation check. |
| success_3 | bool | Result of the third validation check. |

#### Internal Logic
- **Cell 1**: Imports the Marimo module and the `time` module, returning them for use in subsequent cells.
- **Cell 2**: Prompts the user to input a password using Marimo's UI text input and returns the input.
- **Cell 3**: Validates that the password is at least 8 characters long. If not, it stops execution and displays a warning.
- **Cell 4**: Checks if the password contains a dollar sign (`$`). If not, it stops execution and displays a warning.
- **Cell 5**: Ensures the password contains the number `7`, contingent on the first validation passing. If not, it stops execution and displays a warning.
- **Cell 6**: Aggregates the results of all validations. If any validation fails, it stops execution. If all pass, it displays a success message.

## Side Effects
- The script interacts with the user through the Marimo UI, prompting for input and displaying messages.
- It uses the `mo.stop` function to halt execution and display warnings if validations fail.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Provides the framework for building the application, including UI components and control flow mechanisms. |

## Error Handling

The script uses the `mo.stop` function to handle validation failures. This function halts execution and displays a warning message to the user, effectively preventing further execution until the issue is resolved.

## Logging

The script does not implement any explicit logging mechanisms. Feedback to the user is provided through the Marimo UI.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is designed to be run as a standalone application using the Marimo framework.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
