## High-level description

The target file `marimo/_smoke_tests/table_urls.py` is a simple script that uses the `marimo` library to create a web application. This application displays a table with links to Wikipedia pages for New York, London, and Paris. The script is structured to be run as a standalone application, utilizing the `marimo` framework to define and render UI components.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the `marimo` framework, which is used to create and manage the application. The main components are the `app` object, which represents the application, and the `@app.cell` decorators, which define the cells or components of the application. The cells are used to import the `marimo` module and to define a table UI component that displays the URLs.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
The `app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which is the main application object. It is configured with a medium width and is responsible for managing the lifecycle of the application, including running it.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell or component within the `marimo` application. Each cell can contain logic to define UI components or other functionalities.

#### Inputs
