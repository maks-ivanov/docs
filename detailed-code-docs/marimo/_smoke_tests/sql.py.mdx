## High-level description

The target file `marimo/_smoke_tests/sql.py` is a script designed to perform smoke tests on SQL functionalities within the Marimo application framework. It utilizes the Marimo library to create an interactive application that demonstrates SQL operations on datasets, including filtering and visualizing data from the Vega datasets and Google Sheets. The script showcases the integration of SQL queries with UI elements like sliders and dropdowns to dynamically filter and display data.

## Code Structure

The script is structured using the Marimo framework, which allows for the creation of interactive applications with cells that can contain both Python and SQL code. Each cell is decorated with `@app.cell`, indicating that it is a part of the Marimo application. The script imports necessary libraries and datasets, sets up UI components, executes SQL queries, and visualizes the results using Altair charts.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which is used to define the interactive application. It is configured with a medium width and serves as the main container for the cells that make up the application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. Each cell can contain Python code, SQL queries, or a combination of both. Cells can also include UI elements and visualization logic.

### `__()`
#### Description
The function `__()` is used multiple times throughout the script, each time serving a different purpose depending on the context. It is a placeholder function name used by Marimo to define the logic within each cell.

#### Inputs and Outputs
The inputs and outputs of each `__()` function vary based on the cell's purpose. For example, some cells take datasets as inputs and return filtered data, while others return UI components or visualizations.

#### Internal Logic
- **Data Import and Setup**: The script imports necessary libraries and datasets, such as Altair, Vega datasets, and DuckDB.
- **UI Components**: It sets up UI components like sliders and dropdowns to allow user interaction.
- **SQL Queries**: The script executes SQL queries using the `mo.sql` method to filter and manipulate data based on user input.
- **Data Visualization**: It uses Altair to create visualizations of the filtered data, displaying them within the application.

## Side Effects

- The script modifies the state of the Marimo application by adding UI components and visualizations.
- It interacts with external datasets, such as Vega datasets and Google Sheets, to fetch and display data.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Used to create the interactive application and manage UI components. |
| `altair` | Used for data visualization. |
| `vega_datasets` | Provides sample datasets for demonstration purposes. |
| `duckdb` | Executes SQL queries on the datasets. |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors beyond the basic functionality provided by the Marimo framework and the imported libraries. It assumes that the necessary datasets and libraries are available and correctly configured.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms. It focuses on demonstrating SQL functionalities and UI interactions within the Marimo framework.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is designed to be run as a standalone application using the Marimo framework.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code. The script appears to be complete and functional for its intended purpose of demonstrating SQL functionalities within the Marimo framework.
