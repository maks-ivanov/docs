## High-level description

The target file `marimo/_smoke_tests/inputs.py` is a script designed to test the user interface components of the Marimo framework. It defines a series of UI elements such as switches, text inputs, dropdowns, sliders, and radio buttons, and organizes them into layouts using horizontal and vertical stacks. The script is structured to be executed as a standalone application, showcasing the interactive capabilities of the Marimo UI components.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the `marimo.App` class, which is used to create an application instance. The application is composed of several cells, each defined by the `@app.cell` decorator. These cells are responsible for creating and managing different UI components. The components are created using the `marimo.ui` module, which provides various UI elements like switches, text inputs, dropdowns, sliders, and radio buttons. The cells are executed in sequence, and their outputs can be used as inputs for subsequent cells.

## Symbols

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. Each cell represents a unit of functionality, typically involving the creation and configuration of UI components. The decorator allows the function to be registered as part of the application, enabling it to be executed in sequence with other cells.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The Marimo module, used to access UI components and layout functions. |
| disabled | bool | A boolean value indicating whether certain UI components should be disabled. |
| options | list | A list of options used for dropdowns, multi-selects, and radio buttons. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| disabled | bool | The state of the switch component, indicating whether UI elements should be disabled. |
| options | list | The list of options used for UI components like dropdowns and radio buttons. |
| slider | object | A slider UI component. |
| vslider | object | A vertical slider UI component. |

#### Internal Logic
- The first cell imports the Marimo module and returns it for use in subsequent cells.
- The second cell creates a switch UI component to toggle the disabled state of other UI elements.
- The third cell creates a vertical stack of text input components, which are conditionally disabled based on the switch's state.
- The fourth cell creates a vertical stack containing a dropdown and a multi-select component, using a predefined list of options.
- The fifth and sixth cells create radio button components, with the sixth cell arranging them inline.
- The seventh and eighth cells create horizontal and vertical sliders, with the eighth cell displaying the slider values.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Provides the framework and UI components for building the application. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the Marimo framework and UI components are functioning correctly. Any errors would likely be raised by the framework itself.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms. It is focused on UI component testing and does not include logging for debugging or monitoring purposes.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application to test and demonstrate the UI components of the Marimo framework.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code. The script appears to be complete and functional for its intended purpose of UI component testing.
