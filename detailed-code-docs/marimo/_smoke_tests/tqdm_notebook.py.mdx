## High-level description

The target file `tqdm_notebook.py` is a smoke test script for the Marimo framework, specifically testing the integration of the `tqdm` progress bar within a Jupyter notebook environment. It uses the Marimo application framework to create a simple application that demonstrates a progress bar updating over a short loop, simulating a task with time delays.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the Marimo application framework, which uses decorators to define cells of code that are executed in sequence. The script imports necessary modules, defines a simple loop with a progress bar, and runs the application.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to create and manage the application. It is initialized with a width parameter set to "medium".

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell in the Marimo application. Each decorated function represents a cell that can execute code and return results. In this script, it is used to import necessary modules and execute a loop with a progress bar.

### `__()`
#### Description
The `__()` function is a placeholder function name used for each cell. It is defined multiple times with different logic, each time representing a different cell in the Marimo application.

#### Inputs
- The first `__()` function has no inputs and imports the `time` module and the `tqdm` module from `tqdm.notebook`.
- The second `__()` function takes `time` and `tqdm` as inputs, which are the modules imported in the first cell.

#### Outputs
- The first `__()` function returns the `time` and `tqdm` modules.
- The second `__()` function returns the final value of `i` from the loop, which is `9`.

#### Internal Logic
- The first cell imports the `time` and `tqdm` modules and returns them for use in subsequent cells.
- The second cell uses the `tqdm` module to create a progress bar for a loop that iterates 10 times, with a 0.1-second sleep in each iteration to simulate a task. The progress bar visually updates in a Jupyter notebook environment.

### `if __name__ == "__main__":`
#### Description
This conditional statement checks if the script is being run as the main program. If true, it calls `app.run()` to execute the Marimo application.

## References

- `marimo.App`: The main class from the Marimo framework used to create the application.
- `tqdm.notebook.tqdm`: A module from the `tqdm` library that provides a progress bar for Jupyter notebooks.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Used to create and manage the application framework. |
| `tqdm.notebook` | Provides a progress bar for Jupyter notebook environments. |
| `time` | Used to introduce delays in the loop to simulate a task. |

## Error Handling

The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the necessary modules are available and that the environment supports Jupyter notebook features.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms. It relies on the visual output of the `tqdm` progress bar for feedback.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is a standalone script intended to be run in a Jupyter notebook environment.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
