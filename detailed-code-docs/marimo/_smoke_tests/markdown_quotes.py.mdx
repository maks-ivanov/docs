title: "markdown_quotes.py"

## High-level description
The target file `markdown_quotes.py` is a smoke test script for the Marimo framework, specifically testing the rendering of various markdown strings with different types of quotes. It defines several cells within a Marimo application, each cell rendering a markdown string with different quote configurations to ensure proper handling and display.

## Code Structure
The code is structured around the Marimo framework, utilizing its `App` class to define a series of cells. Each cell is a function decorated with `@app.cell`, which allows it to be part of the Marimo application. The cells are responsible for rendering markdown content with different quote scenarios.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to create and manage the Marimo application. It is initialized with a width parameter set to "medium".

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a cell within the Marimo application. Each cell function is responsible for executing a specific task, in this case, rendering markdown content.

### `__`
#### Description
The `__` function is a placeholder name used for multiple cell functions in this script. Each instance of `__` is decorated with `@app.cell` and is responsible for rendering a specific markdown string using the `mo.md()` method.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The Marimo module, used to access markdown rendering functionality. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | None | The function does not return any value. |

#### Internal Logic
Each `__` function calls the `mo.md()` method with a markdown string as an argument. The markdown strings vary in their use of quotes, including escaped quotes, leading quotes, trailing quotes, and single quotes. This tests the Marimo framework's ability to handle different markdown quote scenarios.

### `if __name__ == "__main__":`
#### Description
This block checks if the script is being run as the main program and, if so, calls `app.run()` to start the Marimo application.

## References
- The `marimo` module is imported and used extensively throughout the script, particularly the `App` class and the `mo.md()` method for rendering markdown.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Provides the framework for creating and managing the application, including markdown rendering capabilities. |

## Error Handling
The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It relies on the Marimo framework to handle any exceptions that may occur during markdown rendering.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is a standalone script intended for testing purposes.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
