## High-level description

The target file `marimo/_smoke_tests/ansi.py` is a smoke test script for the Marimo application framework. It primarily demonstrates the use of ANSI escape codes to manipulate text color and formatting in the terminal. The script includes several test cells that print colored text to the console, handle standard input and output, and verify the behavior of ANSI codes in different contexts.

## Code Structure

The script is structured using the Marimo framework, which organizes code into "cells" that are executed as part of an application. Each cell is defined using the `@app.cell` decorator, and the script concludes with a call to `app.run()` to execute the application.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object for organizing and running the smoke tests.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define individual test cells within the Marimo application. Each cell contains a block of code that is executed as part of the application.

### `__()`
#### Description
Each `__()` function represents a test cell in the Marimo application. These functions demonstrate various uses of ANSI escape codes and other terminal interactions.

#### Inputs
No explicit inputs are provided to these functions; they are executed as part of the Marimo application lifecycle.

#### Outputs
The outputs vary by cell, but generally include printed text or returned objects for further inspection.

#### Internal Logic
- **First Cell**: Imports the Marimo module and returns it.
- **Second Cell**: Prints "Hello, World!" in various colors using ANSI escape codes.
- **Third Cell**: Prints a string with multiple ANSI color codes and returns the string.
- **Fourth Cell**: Prints "Hello world" to the standard error stream and returns the `sys` module.
- **Fifth Cell**: Demonstrates that ANSI codes are not converted when not using standard output or error.
- **Sixth Cell**: Prompts the user for input with colored text using ANSI codes.

## Side Effects

- The script prints colored text to the console, which may affect the appearance of the terminal.
- It writes to the standard error stream in one of the cells.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Provides the application framework for organizing and running the smoke tests. |
| `sys`      | Used to demonstrate writing to the standard error stream. |

## Error Handling

The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the operations (such as printing to the console) will succeed without exceptions.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms. Output is directly printed to the console.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application for testing purposes.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
