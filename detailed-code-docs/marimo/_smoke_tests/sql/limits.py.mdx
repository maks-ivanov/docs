## High-level description
The target file `marimo/_smoke_tests/sql/limits.py` is a script designed to perform smoke tests on SQL operations using the Marimo framework. It creates and queries two tables, `small_table` and `large_table`, with varying limits on the number of rows returned. This is likely to test the behavior and performance of SQL queries with different result set sizes.

## Code Structure
The code is structured using the Marimo framework, which allows for the definition of cells that encapsulate specific operations. Each cell is decorated with `@app.cell`, indicating that it is a unit of work within the Marimo application. The script is organized into sections that create tables and perform SQL queries with different limits.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which is used to define and run a Marimo application. It is configured with a medium width.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. Each cell represents a discrete unit of work, such as executing a SQL query or rendering markdown.

### `__()`
#### Description
The function `__()` is used multiple times throughout the script, each time performing a different operation. The function is defined without a name to act as an anonymous cell in the Marimo application.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The Marimo module, used for executing SQL and rendering markdown. |
| small_table | table | The `small_table` created in the script. |
| large_table | table | The `large_table` created in the script. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| _df | DataFrame | The result of the SQL query executed within the cell. |

#### Internal Logic
- The first cell imports the Marimo module.
- Subsequent cells execute SQL commands to create tables and perform queries with different limits.
- Markdown is rendered to separate sections for `small_table` and `large_table`.

## Side Effects
- The script creates two tables, `small_table` and `large_table`, in the SQL environment.
- It executes multiple SQL queries, which may affect the state of the SQL environment.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Used to create and manage the Marimo application, execute SQL queries, and render markdown. |

## Error Handling
The script does not explicitly handle errors. It relies on the Marimo framework to manage any exceptions that occur during the execution of SQL queries or other operations.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms. It is assumed that the Marimo framework provides necessary logging or debugging support.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
