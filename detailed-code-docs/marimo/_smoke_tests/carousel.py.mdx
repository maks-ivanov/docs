## High-level description

The target file `marimo/_smoke_tests/carousel.py` is a script that uses the Marimo framework to create a simple web application. This application fetches the Iris dataset, displays it in a table and a chart, and then presents these elements in a carousel format. The script is structured using Marimo's cell-based execution model, which allows for modular and interactive web applications.

## Code Structure

The script is organized into several cells, each defined by the `@app.cell` decorator. Each cell performs a specific task, such as importing libraries, loading data, creating UI components, and assembling these components into a carousel. The cells are executed in sequence, and the outputs of one cell can be used as inputs for subsequent cells.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which is the main application object in the Marimo framework. It manages the execution of the cells and the lifecycle of the web application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell in the Marimo application. Each cell is a function that performs a specific task and can return values that are used by other cells.

### `__()`
#### Description
This is a placeholder function name used for each cell. Each cell is defined as a function named `__`, which is a convention in this script to keep the focus on the cell's functionality rather than its name.

#### Inputs and Outputs
The inputs and outputs of each cell vary depending on its purpose. For example, some cells import libraries, while others take dataframes or UI components as inputs and return modified versions or new components.

#### Internal Logic
- **First Cell**: Imports necessary libraries (`marimo`, `pandas`, `altair`) and returns them for use in other cells.
- **Second Cell**: Loads the Iris dataset from a URL into a Pandas DataFrame and returns it.
- **Third Cell**: Creates a table UI component using Marimo's UI library and the DataFrame, then returns the table.
- **Fourth Cell**: Creates a chart using Altair and the DataFrame, then returns the chart.
- **Fifth Cell**: Assembles the table and chart into a carousel presentation, adding markdown text for titles and credits.

### `app.run()`
#### Description
This function call starts the Marimo application, executing the defined cells and rendering the web application.

## References

- **Marimo Framework**: The script heavily relies on the Marimo framework for creating and managing the web application.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and loading the Iris dataset.
- **Altair**: Used for creating the chart visualization of the Iris dataset.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Framework for building interactive web applications. |
| `pandas`   | Library for data manipulation and analysis. |
| `altair`   | Library for declarative statistical visualization. |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the data loading and UI component creation will succeed without issues. In a production environment, it would be advisable to add error handling for network requests and data processing.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms. Adding logging could be beneficial for debugging and monitoring the application's behavior.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
