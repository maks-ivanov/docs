## High-level description

The target file `pandas_example.py` is a smoke test script for the Marimo framework, which demonstrates basic usage of the Pandas library within a Marimo application. It defines a few cells that create a Pandas DataFrame with random data, access a column from the DataFrame, and import the NumPy library. The script is structured to run as a standalone application using Marimo's reactive notebook capabilities.

## Code Structure

The script is structured using the Marimo framework, which allows defining reactive cells within an application. Each cell is decorated with `@app.cell`, indicating that it is a reactive component of the Marimo application. The cells are executed in a sequence that respects their dependencies, as defined by the inputs and outputs of each cell.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which represents the Marimo application. It is used to define reactive cells and manage the execution of the application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a reactive cell within the Marimo application. Each decorated function represents a cell that can be executed independently, with its inputs and outputs managed by the Marimo framework.

### `__()`
#### Description
This function is a reactive cell that imports the NumPy library and returns it. It serves as a utility cell to provide NumPy to other cells that require it.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| np | module | The NumPy module, imported and ready for use. |

### `__(np)`
#### Description
This function is a reactive cell that creates a Pandas DataFrame using random numbers generated by NumPy. It returns the DataFrame and the Pandas module.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| np | module | The NumPy module, used to generate random numbers. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| df | DataFrame | A Pandas DataFrame filled with random numbers. |
| pd | module | The Pandas module, imported and ready for use. |

#### Internal Logic
- Imports the Pandas library.
- Creates a DataFrame with 10 rows and 20 columns, filled with random numbers generated by NumPy.
- Returns the DataFrame and the Pandas module.

### `__(df)`
#### Description
This function is a reactive cell that accesses the first column of the provided DataFrame. It demonstrates basic DataFrame manipulation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| df | DataFrame | A Pandas DataFrame from which a column is accessed. |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Accesses the first column of the DataFrame using `df[0]`.
- The function does not return any value, serving as a demonstration of accessing DataFrame columns.

## Side Effects
- The script imports the NumPy and Pandas libraries, which are used within the reactive cells.
- The script creates a DataFrame with random data, which is a temporary object used within the application.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Provides the framework for creating reactive applications. |
| pandas | Used for creating and manipulating DataFrames. |
| numpy | Used for generating random numbers. |

## Error Handling
The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the necessary libraries are available and that the operations on the DataFrame will succeed without errors.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms. It is a simple demonstration script intended for testing purposes.

## TODOs
None
