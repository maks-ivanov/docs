## High-level description
The target file is a script that uses the `marimo` framework to create a series of data visualizations using the `seaborn` library. It loads datasets and generates plots such as joint plots, pair plots, and relational plots to demonstrate the capabilities of `seaborn` in a structured application environment provided by `marimo`.

## Code Structure
The script is structured around the `marimo.App` class, which is used to define and run a series of cells. Each cell is a function decorated with `@app.cell`, which allows for modular execution of code blocks. The script loads datasets using `seaborn` and creates various plots, each in its own cell.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to manage the execution of the script's cells. It provides a framework for organizing and running code in a modular fashion.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the `marimo` application. Each decorated function represents a block of code that can be executed independently within the app's context.

### `__()`
#### Description
There are multiple functions named `__` in the script, each representing a different cell in the `marimo` application. These functions are responsible for loading datasets and creating visualizations using `seaborn`.

#### Inputs and Outputs
- The first `__()` function loads the `penguins` and `tips` datasets using `seaborn` and returns them along with the `seaborn` module.
- The second `__()` function takes the `penguins` dataset and `seaborn` module as inputs and creates a joint plot.
- The third `__()` function also takes the `penguins` dataset and `seaborn` module as inputs and creates a pair plot.
- The fourth `__()` function takes the `tips` dataset and `seaborn` module as inputs and creates a relational plot.

#### Internal Logic
- The first cell imports `seaborn` and loads two datasets: `penguins` and `tips`.
- The second cell uses `seaborn.jointplot` to create a joint plot of `flipper_length_mm` vs. `bill_length_mm` for different species in the `penguins` dataset.
- The third cell uses `seaborn.pairplot` to create a pair plot for the `penguins` dataset, colored by species.
- The fourth cell uses `seaborn.relplot` to create a relational plot of `total_bill` vs. `tip` from the `tips` dataset, with additional styling based on `time`, `smoker`, and `size`.

## References
- The script references the `seaborn` library for data visualization.
- It uses the `marimo` framework to structure the application and manage the execution of code cells.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Provides the framework for structuring and running the application. |
| `seaborn`  | Used for loading datasets and creating visualizations. |

## Error Handling
The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It relies on the `marimo` framework and `seaborn` library to manage any exceptions that may occur during dataset loading or plot creation.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application using the `marimo` framework.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
