## High-level description

The target file `ipython_display.py` is a script designed to run within the Marimo framework, which is a tool for creating interactive applications. This script specifically focuses on demonstrating the use of IPython's display capabilities and the `tikz` library for rendering HTML content and drawing graphics, respectively. It uses Marimo's `@app.cell` decorator to define executable cells that perform specific tasks, such as displaying HTML content and rendering graphics.

## Code Structure

The script is structured around the Marimo framework's `@app.cell` decorator, which is used to define individual cells that execute specific tasks. Each cell is a function that performs a particular operation, such as importing libraries, creating HTML content, or rendering graphics. The cells are executed in sequence, and their outputs can be used as inputs for subsequent cells.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to define and run the application. It provides the `@app.cell` decorator to define executable cells within the script.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a cell within the Marimo application. Each cell can perform a specific task and can return values that are used by other cells.

### `__()`
#### Description
This is a placeholder function name used for each cell. Each cell is defined as a function with the name `__`, which is decorated with `@app.cell`. The function's purpose and functionality depend on the specific cell's implementation.

#### Inputs and Outputs
The inputs and outputs of each cell vary depending on its purpose. For example, some cells import libraries, while others create and display HTML content or render graphics.

#### Internal Logic
- **First Cell**: Imports IPython and Marimo, creates an HTML object with a URL, and returns the imported modules and the URL.
- **Second Cell**: Takes IPython as input, creates an HTML object with "hello world" text, and returns the HTML object.
- **Third Cell**: Takes IPython, HTML, and URL as inputs, displays the HTML and URL using IPython's display function.
- **Fourth Cell**: Imports the `tikz` library and returns it.
- **Fifth Cell**: Takes `tikz` as input, defines coordinates, creates a `Picture` object, draws a line with the coordinates, and returns the coordinates and picture.
- **Sixth Cell**: Takes the `Picture` object as input and calls its `demo` method to render the picture.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Used to create and run the application, and define executable cells. |
| `IPython` | Used for displaying HTML content within the application. |
| `tikz` | Used for creating and rendering graphics. |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors beyond the basic exception handling provided by Python. Any errors during the execution of a cell would likely result in a traceback being displayed.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is designed to be run as a standalone application within the Marimo framework.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
