## High-level description

The `marimo/_smoke_tests/third_party` directory contains a collection of scripts designed to demonstrate the integration of various third-party libraries with the `marimo` framework. Each script serves as a smoke test, showcasing how different visualization and data manipulation libraries can be used within a `marimo` application. The main components include scripts for visualizations using libraries like `Altair`, `HoloViews`, `Plotly`, `Seaborn`, and `Rich`, as well as data manipulation with `Pandas` and `IPython` display capabilities.

## What does it do?

The scripts in this directory are designed to run as standalone applications using the `marimo` framework. They demonstrate how to create interactive and static visualizations, manipulate data, and render styled console output. Each script is structured around the `marimo.App` class, which allows for the definition of "cells" that encapsulate specific pieces of functionality. These cells can import libraries, fetch data, create visualizations, and render UI components. The scripts showcase a variety of workflows, such as:

- **Data Visualization**: Using libraries like `Altair`, `HoloViews`, `Plotly`, and `Seaborn` to create charts and plots. These visualizations include scatter plots, bar charts, 3D surface plots, joint plots, and more.
- **Data Manipulation**: Utilizing `Pandas` and `Polars` for data manipulation tasks, such as creating DataFrames and accessing data columns.
- **Styled Console Output**: Demonstrating the use of the `Rich` library to print styled messages to the console.
- **Interactive UI Components**: Leveraging `marimo`'s UI components to create interactive elements like dropdowns, sliders, and tables.

Each script is designed to be executed in sequence, with the outputs of one cell potentially serving as inputs for another, creating a reactive and interactive application environment.

## Entry points

The directory contains multiple scripts, each serving as an entry point for a specific demonstration:

- **`altair_example.py`**: Demonstrates data visualization using the `Altair` library.
- **`holoviews_example.py`**: Showcases interactive visualizations with `HoloViews`.
- **`ipython_display.py`**: Focuses on IPython's display capabilities and `tikz` for graphics rendering.
- **`pandas_example.py`**: Demonstrates basic usage of the `Pandas` library for data manipulation.
- **`plotly_example.py`**: Integrates `Plotly` visualizations within a `marimo` application.
- **`rich_example.py`**: Uses the `Rich` library for styled console output.
- **`seaborn_example.py`**: Creates data visualizations using the `Seaborn` library.

Each script is organized into cells using the `@app.cell` decorator, which defines the sequence and dependencies of the operations performed.

## Dependencies

The scripts in this directory rely on several external libraries and frameworks:

- **`marimo`**: Provides the framework for creating interactive applications and managing the execution of cells.
- **Visualization Libraries**:
  - `Altair`: Used for declarative statistical visualization.
  - `HoloViews`: Enables interactive visualizations.
  - `Plotly`: Offers both high-level and detailed visualizations.
  - `Seaborn`: Facilitates statistical data visualization.
- **Data Manipulation Libraries**:
  - `Pandas`: Used for creating and manipulating DataFrames.
  - `Polars`: An alternative to Pandas for data manipulation.
- **Other Libraries**:
  - `IPython`: Utilized for displaying HTML content.
  - `Rich`: Provides styled console output.
  - `tikz`: Used for creating and rendering graphics.
  - `vega_datasets`: Supplies example datasets for visualization.

These dependencies are chosen for their capabilities in data visualization, manipulation, and interactive application development, making them suitable for demonstrating the integration with the `marimo` framework.
