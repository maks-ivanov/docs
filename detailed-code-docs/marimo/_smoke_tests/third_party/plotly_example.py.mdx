## High-level description

The target file `plotly_example.py` is a script designed to demonstrate the integration of Plotly visualizations within a Marimo application. It showcases various types of charts, including scatter plots, bar charts, and 3D surface plots, using both Plotly Express and Plotly Graph Objects. The script is structured to run as a standalone application using Marimo's framework, which allows for interactive UI components and data visualization.

## Code Structure

The script is organized into several cells, each defined by the `@app.cell` decorator, which is a feature of the Marimo framework. Each cell encapsulates a specific functionality or step in the visualization process, such as creating a chart, rendering it, or displaying additional UI components like tables and sliders. The cells are executed in sequence when the application runs.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object for the Marimo framework. It is used to define and run the application, managing the lifecycle of the cells and their interactions.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. Each cell represents a discrete unit of functionality, such as rendering a markdown header or creating a Plotly chart. The cells are executed in the order they are defined.

### `__()`
#### Description
The function `__()` is a placeholder for the actual function name, which is not specified in the script. Each occurrence of `__()` represents a different cell in the Marimo application, performing tasks like importing libraries, creating visualizations, or updating the UI.

#### Inputs and Outputs
The inputs and outputs of each `__()` function vary depending on its purpose. For example, some cells take `mo` (Marimo object) and `px` (Plotly Express object) as inputs, while others return visualizations or UI components.

#### Internal Logic
- **Markdown Rendering**: Some cells use `mo.md()` to render markdown content, such as section headers.
- **Plotly Visualizations**: Cells import Plotly libraries and create visualizations using `px.scatter()` or `go.Figure()`.
- **UI Components**: Cells use Marimo's UI components, such as `mo.ui.plotly()` for rendering plots and `mo.ui.table()` for displaying data in tabular form.
- **Data Manipulation**: Some cells manipulate data using libraries like Pandas to prepare it for visualization.

## References

- **Plotly Express (`px`)**: Used for creating simple, high-level visualizations like scatter plots.
- **Plotly Graph Objects (`go`)**: Used for more complex visualizations, such as bar charts and 3D surface plots.
- **Pandas (`pd`)**: Utilized for data manipulation and preparation.
- **Vega Datasets**: Provides sample datasets for visualization.

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors beyond basic exception raising. It assumes that all operations, such as data loading and visualization rendering, will succeed without issues.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms. It focuses on visualization and UI rendering without tracking execution details.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is designed to run as a standalone application using the Marimo framework.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code. The script appears to be complete and functional for its intended purpose of demonstrating Plotly visualizations within a Marimo application.
