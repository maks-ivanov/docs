## High-level description

The target file `rich_example.py` is a simple script that demonstrates the use of the `rich` library for styled console output within the context of a `marimo` application. It defines a few cells using the `marimo` framework to import necessary modules and print styled messages to the console. The script is designed to be run as a standalone application using the `marimo.App` framework.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the `marimo.App` framework, which allows for the definition of "cells" that encapsulate specific pieces of functionality. Each cell is a function decorated with `@app.cell`, and these cells are executed in sequence when the application runs. The cells in this script are used to import modules and demonstrate the use of the `rich` library for printing styled messages.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which is used to define and manage the execution of cells within the script. It serves as the main entry point for the application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the `marimo` application. Each cell is a function that performs a specific task, such as importing a module or executing a piece of logic. The cells are executed in the order they are defined when the application runs.

### First Cell
#### Description
This cell imports the `marimo` module and returns it. It is a setup step to ensure that the `marimo` module is available for use in subsequent cells.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The `marimo` module |

### Second Cell
#### Description
This cell imports the `print` function from the `rich` library, aliased as `pprint`, and returns it. This allows for styled console output in subsequent cells.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| pprint | function | The `print` function from the `rich` library, used for styled output |

### Third Cell
#### Description
This cell uses the `pprint` function to print two styled messages to the console: an error message in bold red and a success message in green.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| pprint | function | The `print` function from the `rich` library |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- The cell calls `pprint` with a string formatted using `rich`'s markup to display a bold red error message.
- It then calls `pprint` again to display a green success message.

## Side Effects
- The third cell produces console output by printing styled messages using the `rich` library.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Used to create and manage the application and its cells. |
| `rich` | Provides functionality for styled console output. |

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this script. It assumes that the `rich` library is installed and available for import.

## Logging
There is no logging implemented in this script. The focus is on demonstrating styled console output using `rich`.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose any API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
