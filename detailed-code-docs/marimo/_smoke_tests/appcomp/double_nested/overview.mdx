## High-level description

The `marimo/_smoke_tests/appcomp/double_nested` directory is part of a smoke test suite for the Marimo framework, which is designed for building interactive applications. This directory contains a set of files that demonstrate the use of Marimo's cell-based application structure to create nested applications and perform basic computations. The main components within this directory are three Python files: `inner.py`, `middle.py`, and `main.py`. Each file defines a Marimo application that interacts with the others, showcasing the framework's capabilities for embedding applications and processing results.

## What does it do?

The code in this directory demonstrates how to build interactive applications using the Marimo framework. It creates a series of applications that allow users to input numbers and perform basic arithmetic operations. The applications are structured using Marimo's cell-based approach, where each cell represents a unit of computation or a step in the workflow. The applications are nested, meaning that one application can embed another and process its results.

- **Inner Application (`inner.py`)**: This application allows users to input two numbers and calculates their sum. It uses Marimo's UI components to create interactive input fields and displays the result using markdown.

- **Middle Application (`middle.py`)**: This application imports the inner application and embeds it. It calculates the sum of two values from the inner application's output and displays the result using markdown.

- **Main Application (`main.py`)**: This application imports the middle application and embeds it. It processes the results from the middle application and retrieves the final calculation.

The workflow involves executing each application in sequence, with each application embedding the previous one and processing its results. This demonstrates the Marimo framework's ability to handle nested applications and pass data between them.

## Entry points

The main files in this directory are `inner.py`, `middle.py`, and `main.py`. Each file represents a different level of the nested application structure:

- **`inner.py`**: Defines the innermost application, which performs basic arithmetic operations.
- **`middle.py`**: Embeds the inner application and processes its results.
- **`main.py`**: Embeds the middle application and retrieves the final output.

The code is organized such that each file builds upon the previous one, demonstrating the Marimo framework's capabilities for creating complex, nested applications.

## Dependencies

The primary dependency for this directory is the Marimo framework, which provides the tools and components necessary for building interactive applications. The framework is used to define applications, create UI components, and manage the execution of application cells. The Marimo framework is essential for the functionality demonstrated in this directory, as it enables the cell-based structure and interactive elements used in the applications.
