title: "middle.py"

## High-level description

The target file, `middle.py`, is part of a smoke test suite for the Marimo framework. It defines a Marimo application that demonstrates the use of nested applications and cell-based computation. The application calculates the sum of two values, `x` and `y`, and displays the result using Marimo's markdown rendering capabilities.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the Marimo framework's concept of "cells," which are essentially functions decorated with `@app.cell`. Each cell performs a specific task, such as importing modules, rendering markdown, or performing calculations. The cells are executed in sequence, and their results can be passed to subsequent cells.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
The `app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which represents the Marimo application. It is configured with a medium width and serves as the main entry point for the application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. Each cell is a function that performs a specific task and can return values to be used by other cells.

### First Cell
#### Description
This cell imports the Marimo module and returns it. It is used to make the Marimo module available for subsequent cells.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The Marimo module |

### Second Cell
#### Description
This cell imports the `app` from the `inner` module and returns it. It demonstrates the use of nested applications within Marimo.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| app | module | The inner application module |

### Third Cell
#### Description
This cell uses the Marimo module to render a markdown header with the text "# middle". It serves as a simple demonstration of Marimo's markdown rendering capabilities.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The Marimo module |

### Fourth Cell
#### Description
This cell calculates the sum of two values, `x` and `y`, from the `result` object and renders a markdown message displaying the calculation. It returns the calculated sum.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The Marimo module |
| result | object | The result object containing definitions of `x` and `y` |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| x_plus_y | int/float | The sum of `x` and `y` |

#### Internal Logic
- Accesses `x` and `y` values from `result.defs`.
- Calculates their sum.
- Uses `mo.md` to render a markdown message with the result.

### Fifth Cell
#### Description
This asynchronous cell embeds the inner application and retrieves its output. It returns the result object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| app | module | The inner application module |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | object | The result object from the embedded application |

#### Internal Logic
- Calls `app.embed()` to embed the inner application.
- Awaits the result and accesses its output.

### `if __name__ == "__main__":`
#### Description
This block checks if the script is being run as the main module and, if so, calls `app.run()` to start the Marimo application.

## References

- The `marimo` module is heavily used throughout the file, providing the `App` class and markdown rendering capabilities.
- The `inner` module is referenced to import another application, demonstrating nested application functionality.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Provides the framework for building and running the application |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors. It relies on the Marimo framework to manage any exceptions that may occur during cell execution.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms. It focuses on demonstrating the functionality of Marimo applications through cell execution and markdown rendering.
