## High-level description

The target file `inner.py` is part of a smoke test suite for the Marimo framework. It defines a simple application using the Marimo library, which is a framework for building interactive applications. The code creates a series of interactive cells that allow users to input numbers and perform basic operations on them.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the `marimo.App` class, which is used to create an application. The application consists of several cells, each defined by the `@app.cell` decorator. These cells are executed in sequence and can pass data between each other. The cells use the Marimo UI components to create interactive elements.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to define and run the application. It serves as the main entry point for the application and manages the execution of the cells.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. Each cell is a function that can perform computations, interact with the user, and return values to be used by other cells.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The Marimo module, used for accessing UI components and other functionalities. |
| x | int | A number input by the user. |
| y | int | Another number input by the user. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The Marimo module, returned for use in other cells. |
| x | int | The user-input number, returned for use in other cells. |
| y | int | Another user-input number, returned for use in other cells. |

#### Internal Logic
- The first cell imports the Marimo module and returns it for use in subsequent cells.
- The second cell uses the Marimo module to display a markdown header.
- The third and fifth cells create number input fields using Marimo's UI components, allowing the user to input numbers between 1 and 10.
- The fourth and sixth cells simply return the values of `x` and `y`, respectively.
- The seventh cell adds the values of `x` and `y` and returns the result.

## Side Effects
- The code creates interactive UI elements that allow user input.
- The application runs in an interactive environment when executed.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Used to create the application and UI components. |

## Error Handling
The code does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It relies on the Marimo framework to manage any errors that occur during the execution of the cells.

## Logging
The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The code does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
