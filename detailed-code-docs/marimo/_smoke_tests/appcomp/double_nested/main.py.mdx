title: "main.py"
---

## High-level description
The target file `main.py` is part of a smoke test suite for the Marimo application framework. It defines a simple application using the Marimo framework, which involves embedding a nested application and processing its results. The code demonstrates the use of Marimo's cell-based application structure to compose and execute a series of operations.

## Code Structure
The code is structured around the Marimo application framework, which uses a decorator-based approach to define application cells. Each cell represents a unit of computation or a step in the application workflow. The main symbols in the code are the `app` object, which represents the Marimo application, and the decorated functions (cells) that define the application's behavior.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
The `app` symbol is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which represents the Marimo application. It is configured with a medium width and serves as the main entry point for the application.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| width | str | The width configuration for the application, set to "medium". |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| app | marimo.App | The configured Marimo application instance. |

### `@app.cell` Decorated Functions
#### Description
These functions are decorated with `@app.cell`, indicating that they are part of the Marimo application's workflow. Each function represents a step in the application, performing specific tasks and passing results to subsequent steps.

#### Inputs and Outputs
1. **First Cell Function**
   - **Inputs**: None
   - **Outputs**: A tuple containing the `middle` application object.
   - **Description**: Imports the `middle` application from the `middle` module and returns it.

2. **Second Cell Function**
   - **Inputs**: `middle` (the application object from the first cell)
   - **Outputs**: A tuple containing the `result` object.
   - **Description**: Asynchronously calls the `embed` method on the `middle` application and returns the result.

3. **Third Cell Function**
   - **Inputs**: `result` (the result object from the second cell)
   - **Outputs**: None
   - **Description**: Accesses the `defs` dictionary of the `result` object to retrieve the "x_plus_y" definition.

## Side Effects
- The code imports and utilizes the `middle` application, which is assumed to be defined in another module.
- The `result` object is expected to have an `output` attribute and a `defs` dictionary, which are accessed but not modified.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Provides the application framework and cell-based structure for defining the application. |

## Error Handling
The code does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the `middle` application and its methods (`embed`) will execute successfully. Any exceptions raised during execution would need to be handled externally or by the Marimo framework.

## Logging
The code does not implement any logging mechanisms. Any logging would need to be added separately if required.

## API/Interface Reference
The code does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application using the Marimo framework.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
