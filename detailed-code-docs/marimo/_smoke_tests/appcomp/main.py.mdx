## High-level description

The target file `marimo/_smoke_tests/appcomp/main.py` is a script designed to perform smoke tests on a Marimo application. It demonstrates various functionalities of the Marimo framework, such as rendering applications multiple times, embedding applications within tabs, and using function calls to render applications. The script is structured using Marimo's cell-based execution model, which allows for modular and interactive code execution.

## Code Structure

The script is organized into several cells, each defined using the `@app.cell` decorator. These cells are executed in sequence and are responsible for different parts of the application's functionality. The script imports and utilizes other components, such as the `inner` and `make_table` modules, to demonstrate embedding and rendering capabilities.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
The `app` symbol is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, initialized with a medium width. It serves as the main application object that orchestrates the execution of the cells and manages the application's lifecycle.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. Each cell represents a discrete unit of code that can be executed independently. The cells in this script perform various tasks, such as importing modules, rendering markdown, embedding applications, and accessing application results.

#### Inputs and Outputs
Each cell can have different inputs and outputs depending on its purpose. For example, some cells take the `app` or `mo` (Marimo module) as input and return rendered content or application results.

#### Internal Logic
- **Importing Modules**: Some cells import modules like `inner` and `make_table` to access their respective `app` objects.
- **Rendering Markdown**: Cells use the `mo.md` method to render markdown content, which is displayed in the application.
- **Embedding Applications**: Cells use the `app.embed()` method to embed applications and access their outputs.
- **Accessing Results**: Cells access specific values from the application results, such as `result.defs["x"].value`.

## References

- **`inner` Module**: The script imports the `app` object from the `inner` module, which is used to demonstrate embedding an application.
- **`make_table` Module**: The script imports the `app` object from the `make_table` module to demonstrate rendering a table within the application.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Provides the framework for building and running the application, including the `App` class and UI components. |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors. It relies on the Marimo framework's built-in error handling mechanisms.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms. It focuses on demonstrating the application's functionality through interactive cells.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application for testing and demonstration purposes.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code. The script appears to be complete and functional for its intended purpose.
