## High-level description

The `marimo/_smoke_tests/appcomp` directory is part of a smoke test suite for the Marimo framework, which is designed for building interactive applications. This directory contains several subdirectories and files that demonstrate various functionalities of the Marimo framework, such as nested applications, imperative output handling, and state management. The main components within this directory include:

- **Nested Applications**: Demonstrated through the `double_nested` subdirectory, which contains applications that embed one another to perform arithmetic operations.
- **Imperative Output**: Illustrated in the `imperative_output` subdirectory, showcasing how to control application behavior and output using imperative programming.
- **State Management**: Shown in the `state` subdirectory, which includes applications that manage UI state changes through interactive components like buttons.

## What does it do?

The code in this directory demonstrates how to build interactive applications using the Marimo framework. It showcases different aspects of application development, including:

1. **Nested Applications**: The `double_nested` subdirectory contains applications that allow users to input numbers and perform arithmetic operations. These applications are structured using Marimo's cell-based approach, where each cell represents a unit of computation. The applications are nested, meaning one application can embed another and process its results.

2. **Imperative Output Handling**: The `imperative_output` subdirectory demonstrates how to build applications using imperative programming. It includes applications that render markdown, display progress bars, and manage output content. The applications are composed of multiple "cells," which are functions that execute specific tasks.

3. **State Management**: The `state` subdirectory contains applications that manage state within a UI context. It includes a button that toggles its state when clicked, demonstrating how to manage state changes and UI interactions using the Marimo framework.

Each subdirectory and file within this directory serves as a standalone demonstration of specific functionalities of the Marimo framework, providing examples of how to build and manage interactive applications.

## Entry points

The directory contains several main files that serve as entry points for the applications:

- **`double_nested/inner.py`**: Defines the innermost application, which performs basic arithmetic operations.
- **`double_nested/middle.py`**: Embeds the inner application and processes its results.
- **`double_nested/main.py`**: Embeds the middle application and retrieves the final output.

- **`imperative_output/imperative_output.py`**: Defines an application using the `marimo.App` framework, with cells demonstrating markdown rendering, progress bar display, and output replacement.
- **`imperative_output/main.py`**: Defines an application using `marimo.App`, with cells that import and utilize components from `imperative_output.py`, as well as demonstrating asynchronous operations.

- **`state/main.py`**: Sets up the application using the `marimo` library, defining cells that interact with the application's state and embedding functionality.
- **`state/state.py`**: Demonstrates the core functionality of the application, focusing on state management and UI components.

## Key Files

- **`make_table.py`**: Uses the `marimo` library to create a simple application with a user interface table, demonstrating the creation and display of UI components.

## Dependencies

The directory relies on the following external libraries:

- **`marimo`**: Provides the framework for building and managing applications, including the `App` class and UI components. It is essential for the functionality demonstrated in this directory, enabling the cell-based structure and interactive elements used in the applications.

- **`time`**: Used in the `imperative_output` subdirectory to introduce delays in the execution of certain cells, simulating time-consuming operations like progress bar updates.

These dependencies are crucial for demonstrating the functionalities of the Marimo framework and managing the timing of operations within the applications.
