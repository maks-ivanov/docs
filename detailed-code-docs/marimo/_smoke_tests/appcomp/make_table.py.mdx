## High-level description

The target file `make_table.py` is a script that uses the `marimo` library to create a simple application with a user interface table. The table is populated with predefined data and is part of a series of smoke tests for the `marimo` application components. The script defines a series of cells that are executed in sequence to build and display the table.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the `marimo` library's `App` class, which is used to create an application instance. The application is composed of several cells, each defined by the `@app.cell` decorator. These cells are executed in sequence to import necessary modules, create a table, and display it.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
The `app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which represents the application being created. It is initialized with a width parameter set to "medium".

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| width | str | The width of the application interface, set to "medium". |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| app | marimo.App | The application instance. |

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the `marimo` application. Each cell is a function that performs a specific task, such as importing modules or creating UI components.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The `marimo` module, imported within the first cell. |
| t | marimo.ui.table | The table object created in the second cell. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The `marimo` module, returned by the first cell. |
| t | marimo.ui.table | The table object, returned by the second cell. |

#### Internal Logic
- The first cell imports the `marimo` module and returns it.
- The second cell uses the `marimo` module to create a table with predefined data and returns the table object.
- The third cell simply returns the table object, effectively displaying it.

## References

The target file references the `marimo` library, which is crucial for creating the application and its components. The related file `main.py` also uses the `marimo` library and imports the `app` from `make_table.py` to embed it within another application context.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Used to create and manage the application and its UI components. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the `marimo` library functions as expected and that the data provided to the table is valid.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The code does not expose an API or public interface. It is a standalone script intended to be run as part of a smoke test suite.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
