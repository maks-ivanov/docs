## High-level description

The target file `inner.py` is part of a smoke test suite for the Marimo framework. It defines a simple application using the Marimo library, which is a framework for building interactive applications. The code sets up a series of interactive cells that allow users to input numbers and perform a basic addition operation on them.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the Marimo framework's concept of "cells," which are essentially functions decorated with `@app.cell`. Each cell can take inputs, perform operations, and return outputs. The cells are executed in sequence, and their outputs can be used as inputs for subsequent cells. The main symbols in the code are the `app` object and the decorated cell functions.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object. It is used to define and manage the lifecycle of the application, including the execution of cells.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. Each decorated function represents a cell that can perform computations, interact with the user interface, and pass data to other cells.

### Cell Functions
Each cell function is defined with the `@app.cell` decorator and performs a specific task within the application.

#### Inputs and Outputs
- The first cell imports the Marimo library and returns it for use in subsequent cells.
- The second cell uses the Marimo library to display a markdown header.
- The third and fifth cells prompt the user to input a number between 1 and 10 using the Marimo UI.
- The fourth and sixth cells simply return the input values without modification.
- The seventh cell adds the values of `x` and `y` and returns the result.

#### Internal Logic
- The cells are executed in sequence, with the output of one cell potentially serving as the input to another.
- The UI elements are created using the `mo.ui.number` method, which allows users to input numbers.
- The final cell performs an addition operation on the values of `x` and `y`.

## Side Effects

- The code interacts with the user interface to collect input values.
- It displays a markdown header using the Marimo UI.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Used to create and manage the application, define UI elements, and handle cell execution. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors. It relies on the Marimo framework to manage any exceptions that may occur during cell execution.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The code does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application using the Marimo framework.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
