## High-level description
The target file is a Python script that utilizes the `marimo` library to create a simple application with a medium width. It defines a few cells using the `@app.cell` decorator, which are functions that perform specific tasks within the application. The script is designed to run the application when executed as the main module.

## Code Structure
The main symbols in the code are the `marimo.App` instance and the functions decorated with `@app.cell`. The `marimo.App` instance, `app`, is the central object that manages the application's lifecycle and configuration. The functions decorated with `@app.cell` are executed as part of the application's logic, and they interact with the `app` object or other imported modules.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
The `app` is an instance of `marimo.App` with a specified width of "medium". It serves as the main application object that manages the lifecycle and configuration of the application.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| width | str | The width of the application, set to "medium". |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| app | marimo.App | The application instance. |

### `@app.cell` Decorated Functions
These functions are decorated with `@app.cell`, indicating that they are part of the application's logic and are executed in the context of the `marimo` application.

#### First `@app.cell` Function
##### Description
This function imports the `app` from the `imperative_output` module and returns it. It is likely used to integrate or reference another application within the current application.

##### Inputs
None

##### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| app | module | The imported `app` module from `imperative_output`. |

#### Second `@app.cell` Function
##### Description
This function imports the `marimo` library as `mo` and returns it. This allows other parts of the application to use the `marimo` library under the alias `mo`.

##### Inputs
None

##### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The `marimo` library imported as `mo`. |

#### Third `@app.cell` Function
##### Description
This asynchronous function takes the `app` as an input, calls the `embed` method on it, and accesses the `output` attribute. It does not return any value, indicating that its purpose is likely to trigger some side effect related to the application's output.

##### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| app | marimo.App | The application instance. |

##### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- The function awaits the `embed` method on the `app` object, which is likely an asynchronous operation that prepares or modifies the application's output.
- It accesses the `output` attribute of the result, which might trigger some rendering or display logic.

## Side Effects
- The third `@app.cell` function may modify the application's output or trigger rendering logic by accessing the `output` attribute after calling `embed`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Provides the `App` class and related functionality for building and managing the application. |

## Error Handling
The code does not explicitly handle errors. Any exceptions raised during the execution of the `@app.cell` functions or the `app.run()` method would need to be managed by the `marimo` library or the Python runtime.

## Logging
The code does not implement any logging mechanisms. Any logging would need to be handled by the `marimo` library or added manually.

## API/Interface Reference
The code does not explicitly define an API or public interface. It is a script intended to be run as a standalone application.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
