## High-level description

The target file `imperative_output.py` is a script that uses the `marimo` library to create a simple application with a series of cells that demonstrate various functionalities such as markdown rendering, progress bar display, and output replacement. The script is structured to run as an application using the `marimo.App` framework, and it showcases the use of imperative programming to control the output and behavior of the application.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the `marimo.App` framework, which is used to define an application with a series of cells. Each cell is a function decorated with `@app.cell`, and these cells are executed in sequence when the application runs. The cells demonstrate different functionalities of the `marimo` library, such as rendering markdown, displaying a progress bar, and replacing output content.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App` initialized with a specified width of "medium". It serves as the main application object that manages the execution of the decorated cell functions.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a cell within the `marimo` application. Each decorated function represents a cell that performs a specific task when the application runs.

### Cell Functions
Each cell function is defined with the `@app.cell` decorator and performs a specific task using the `marimo` library.

#### First Cell Function
##### Description
This cell imports the `marimo` library as `mo` and returns it. It serves as a setup step for subsequent cells that require access to the `marimo` library.

##### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The `marimo` module imported as `mo`. |

#### Second Cell Function
##### Description
This cell uses the `marimo` library to render a markdown header with the text "hello". It demonstrates the use of `marimo` for rendering markdown content.

##### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The `marimo` module. |

#### Third Cell Function
##### Description
This cell displays a progress bar using `marimo` and the `time` module to simulate a delay. It iterates over a range of 5, pausing for 0.5 seconds at each step, and prints the current iteration index.

##### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The `marimo` module. |
| time | module | The `time` module for introducing delays. |

##### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| i | int | The last index of the iteration. |

#### Fourth Cell Function
##### Description
This cell demonstrates output replacement using `marimo`. It initially replaces the output with a markdown header "output", waits for 0.5 seconds, and then replaces it with "replaced".

##### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The `marimo` module. |

##### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| time | module | The `time` module, returned for potential use in subsequent cells. |

## Side Effects

- The third cell function prints to the console during the progress bar iteration.
- The fourth cell function modifies the output display by replacing it with different markdown content.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Used to create and manage the application, render markdown, display progress bars, and replace output content. |
| `time` | Used to introduce delays in the execution of certain cells. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that all operations, such as importing modules and using `marimo` functionalities, will succeed without exceptions.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms. Output is directly printed to the console in the third cell function.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
