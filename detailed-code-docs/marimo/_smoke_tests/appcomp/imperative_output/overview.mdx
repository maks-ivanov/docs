## High-level description

The `marimo/_smoke_tests/appcomp/imperative_output` directory contains Python scripts that utilize the `marimo` library to create simple applications demonstrating various functionalities. The main components within this directory are two scripts: `imperative_output.py` and `main.py`. Both scripts leverage the `marimo.App` framework to define applications with a series of cells, each performing specific tasks. These tasks include rendering markdown, displaying progress bars, and managing output content. The scripts are structured to run as applications, showcasing the use of imperative programming to control application behavior and output.

## What does it do?

The scripts in this directory demonstrate how to build and run simple applications using the `marimo` library. They define applications composed of multiple "cells," which are essentially functions that execute specific tasks. Here's a breakdown of the workflows implemented:

1. **Application Initialization**: Both scripts create an instance of `marimo.App`, which serves as the main application object. This object manages the lifecycle and configuration of the application.

2. **Cell Definition**: Functions are decorated with `@app.cell`, marking them as part of the application's logic. These functions are executed in sequence when the application runs.

3. **Functionality Demonstration**:
   - **Markdown Rendering**: One of the cells demonstrates how to render markdown content using `marimo`, displaying a simple header.
   - **Progress Bar Display**: Another cell shows how to display a progress bar, simulating a delay with the `time` module to iterate over a range of values.
   - **Output Replacement**: A cell demonstrates replacing output content, initially displaying one message and then replacing it with another after a short delay.

4. **Asynchronous Operations**: In `main.py`, an asynchronous cell function calls the `embed` method on the application instance, potentially triggering some rendering or display logic.

These scripts are designed to be run as standalone applications, showcasing the capabilities of the `marimo` library in managing application output and behavior through imperative programming.

## Entry points

The directory contains two main files that serve as entry points for the applications:

- **`imperative_output.py`**: This script defines an application using the `marimo.App` framework, with cells demonstrating markdown rendering, progress bar display, and output replacement.

- **`main.py`**: This script also defines an application using `marimo.App`, with cells that import and utilize components from `imperative_output.py`, as well as demonstrating asynchronous operations with the `embed` method.

Both scripts are structured to run as applications, with the `marimo.App` instance managing the execution of the decorated cell functions. The data flow involves importing necessary modules and defining cell functions that interact with the `marimo` library to perform specific tasks. The control flow is managed by the `marimo.App` framework, which executes the cell functions in sequence when the application runs.

## Dependencies

The directory relies on the following external libraries:

- **`marimo`**: This library provides the `App` class and related functionality for building and managing applications. It is used to render markdown, display progress bars, and manage output content.

- **`time`**: This standard Python module is used to introduce delays in the execution of certain cells, simulating time-consuming operations like progress bar updates.

These dependencies are essential for demonstrating the functionalities of the `marimo` library and managing the timing of operations within the applications.
