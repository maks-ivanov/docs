## High-level description

The target file is a simple application built using the `marimo` library, which is designed to demonstrate state management in a UI context. It creates a button that, when clicked, changes the state from `False` to `True`, and displays a message indicating whether the button has been clicked.

## Code Structure

The code is structured using the `marimo` library's `App` and `cell` constructs. The `App` object is initialized with a specific width, and several `cell` functions are defined to manage the state and UI components. Each `cell` function is responsible for a specific part of the application's logic, such as importing modules, managing state, creating UI elements, and displaying messages.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
The `app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which serves as the main application object. It is configured with a width of "medium" and is responsible for running the application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell in the `marimo` application. Each cell represents a unit of computation or UI logic that can be executed independently.

### `__()`
#### Description
This function is defined multiple times with different purposes, each decorated with `@app.cell`. Each version of `__()` serves a different role in the application, such as importing modules, managing state, creating UI elements, and displaying messages.

#### Inputs and Outputs
- The first `__()` function imports the `marimo` module and returns it.
- The second `__()` function initializes state management with `mo.state(False)` and returns the `get_state` and `set_state` functions.
- The third `__()` function creates a button UI element and sets its `on_change` event to update the state to `True`.
- The fourth `__()` function checks the state and returns a message indicating whether the button was clicked.

#### Internal Logic
- The state is initialized to `False` using `mo.state(False)`.
- A button is created using `mo.ui.button`, and its `on_change` event is linked to a lambda function that sets the state to `True`.
- The final cell checks the state using `get_state()` and returns a message based on the state value.

## References

- The `marimo` library is heavily referenced throughout the code, providing the `App`, `cell`, `state`, and `ui` functionalities.
- The `mo.state` function is used to manage the application's state.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Provides the framework for building the application, including state management and UI components. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the `marimo` library functions will execute without exceptions.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The code does not expose an API or public interface. It is a standalone application meant to be run directly.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
