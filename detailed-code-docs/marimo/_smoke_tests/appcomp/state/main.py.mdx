## High-level description
The target file is a Python script that utilizes the `marimo` library to create a simple application with a medium width. It defines two asynchronous cells that interact with the application's state and embed functionality. The script is designed to be executed as a standalone application.

## Code Structure
The code is structured around the `marimo` library, which is used to create an application instance. The application is defined with two cells, each performing specific tasks related to the application's state and embedding functionality. The script concludes with a conditional statement to run the application if the script is executed directly.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
The `app` symbol is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which represents the application being created. It is initialized with a width parameter set to "medium".

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| width | str | Specifies the width of the application, set to "medium". |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| app | marimo.App | An instance of the application. |

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the `marimo` application. Each cell is a function that performs a specific task and can interact with the application's state or UI components.

#### Internal Logic
- The first cell imports the `app` from the `state` module and returns it.
- The second cell is asynchronous and awaits the embedding of the application, accessing its output.

### `__()`
#### Description
The `__()` function is a placeholder function defined as a cell in the `marimo` application. It is used to perform specific tasks within the application.

#### Inputs
- For the first cell: None
- For the second cell: `app` (an instance of the application)

#### Outputs
- For the first cell: Returns the `app` imported from the `state` module.
- For the second cell: None, but it performs an asynchronous operation on the application's embed output.

#### Internal Logic
- The first cell imports the `app` from the `state` module and returns it.
- The second cell awaits the `embed` method of the `app` and accesses its output.

## Side Effects
- The script modifies the application's state by embedding it and accessing its output.
- The script runs the application when executed directly.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Used to create and manage the application and its cells. |

## Error Handling
The code does not explicitly handle errors. It relies on the `marimo` library's internal mechanisms for managing any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the cells or the application.

## Logging
The code does not implement any logging mechanisms. Any logging would be handled by the `marimo` library if it provides such functionality.

## API/Interface Reference
The code does not explicitly define an API or public interface. It is designed to be executed as a standalone script that runs the `marimo` application.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
