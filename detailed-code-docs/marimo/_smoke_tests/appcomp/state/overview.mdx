## High-level description

The `marimo/_smoke_tests/appcomp/state` directory contains a simple application built using the `marimo` library. This application is designed to demonstrate state management in a user interface (UI) context. It consists of two main Python scripts: `main.py` and `state.py`. These scripts work together to create an application that manages state changes and UI interactions, specifically through a button that toggles its state when clicked.

## What does it do?

The application in this directory is a basic demonstration of how to manage state within a UI using the `marimo` library. It creates a button that, when clicked, changes the application's state from `False` to `True`. This state change is reflected in a message displayed to the user, indicating whether the button has been clicked.

- **State Management**: The application initializes a state variable to `False`. When the button is clicked, this state is updated to `True`.
- **UI Interaction**: A button is created in the UI. The button's `on_change` event is linked to a function that updates the state.
- **Feedback**: The application checks the state and displays a message to the user, indicating whether the button has been clicked.

## Entry points

The directory contains two main scripts that serve as entry points for the application:

1. **`main.py`**: This script sets up the application using the `marimo` library. It defines two asynchronous cells that interact with the application's state and embedding functionality. The script is designed to be executed as a standalone application, running the `marimo` app when executed directly.

2. **`state.py`**: This script demonstrates the core functionality of the application, focusing on state management and UI components. It initializes the application with a specific width and defines several cells to manage the state and UI elements, such as the button and the message display.

## Key Files

- **`main.py`**: This file is responsible for setting up the application using the `marimo` library. It defines the application instance and the cells that interact with the application's state and embedding functionality.

- **`state.py`**: This file contains the main logic for the application's state management and UI components. It defines the state, creates the button, and manages the message display based on the state.

## Dependencies

The application relies on the `marimo` library, which provides the framework for building the application, including state management and UI components. The `marimo` library is used to create the application instance, define cells, manage state, and create UI elements like buttons.
