## High-level description

The target file `marimo/_smoke_tests/sidebar.py` is a script designed to test the sidebar functionality of a web application using the Marimo framework. It defines several UI components, such as a sidebar with navigation links and buttons, and demonstrates how to structure and render these components using Marimo's API.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the `marimo.App` class, which is used to create an application instance. The application is composed of several cells, each defined by the `@app.cell` decorator. These cells contain functions that define UI components and their layout. The main symbols in the code are the `app` instance and the functions decorated with `@app.cell`, which are responsible for rendering different parts of the UI.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object. It is used to define and manage the UI components and their interactions.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a cell in the Marimo application. Each cell represents a distinct part of the UI and can contain logic to render components or handle interactions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | object | An instance of the Marimo framework, providing methods to create UI components. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | None | The functions do not return any meaningful value; they are used for their side effects of rendering UI components. |

#### Internal Logic
- The first cell defines a sidebar with a markdown header and a navigation menu. The menu includes links to home, about, and contact sections, as well as external links to Twitter and GitHub.
- The second cell creates two buttons with icons, demonstrating how to use icons in button labels.
- The third cell imports the Marimo module and returns it, likely for testing or debugging purposes.
- The fourth and fifth cells define navigation menus with different configurations, showcasing the flexibility of the `mo.nav_menu` method.

## Side Effects
- The code modifies the UI state by rendering components such as sidebars, buttons, and navigation menus.
- It uses the Marimo framework to manage the layout and appearance of these components.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Provides the framework and API for building and rendering UI components. |

## Error Handling
The code does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It relies on the Marimo framework to manage any errors that occur during the rendering of UI components.

## Logging
The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The code does not explicitly define an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone script to test the sidebar functionality.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
