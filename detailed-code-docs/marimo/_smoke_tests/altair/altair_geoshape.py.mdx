## High-level description

The target file `altair_geoshape.py` is a smoke test script for the Marimo application framework, specifically demonstrating the integration of Altair for geospatial data visualization. It fetches geospatial data, filters it, and visualizes it using Altair's geoshape charting capabilities. The script is structured to run as a standalone application using Marimo's app framework.

## Code Structure

The script is organized into several cells, each defined by the `@app.cell` decorator, which is a feature of the Marimo framework. Each cell performs a specific task, such as importing libraries, fetching and processing data, creating visualizations, and displaying them using Marimo's UI components. The cells are executed in sequence when the application runs.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which is used to define and run the application. It is configured with a medium width.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell in the Marimo application. Each cell is a function that performs a specific task, such as importing modules, processing data, or rendering UI components.

### `__()`
#### Description
Multiple functions are defined with the name `__()`, each decorated with `@app.cell`. These functions perform various tasks in the application workflow.

#### Inputs and Outputs
Each function may have different inputs and outputs, depending on its role in the application. For example, some functions import modules and return them, while others process data or create visualizations.

#### Internal Logic
- **Importing Modules**: Some cells import necessary libraries like `altair`, `geopandas`, and `vega_datasets`, and return them for use in other cells.
- **Data Fetching and Processing**: A cell fetches geospatial data from a URL, processes it using `geopandas`, and filters it to focus on the African continent.
- **Visualization**: A cell creates a geoshape chart using Altair, encoding the fill color based on country names.
- **UI Rendering**: Cells use Marimo's UI components to render the chart and display it in a table format.

## Side Effects

- **Data Fetching**: The script fetches geospatial data from an external URL, which may affect performance depending on network conditions.
- **UI Rendering**: The script modifies the UI state by rendering charts and tables using Marimo's UI components.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Used for creating and running the application, and rendering UI components. |
| `altair` | Used for creating geospatial visualizations. |
| `geopandas` | Used for handling geospatial data. |
| `vega_datasets` | Provides sample datasets for use with Altair. |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors. Any issues with data fetching or processing would likely result in runtime exceptions.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is designed to run as a standalone application.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
