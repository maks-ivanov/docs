## High-level description

The target file `altair_charts.py` is a script designed to create and display various types of Altair charts using the Marimo framework. It leverages datasets from the `vega_datasets` library and provides interactive UI elements for users to select chart configurations such as selection type and theme. The script is structured to run as a Marimo application, showcasing different chart types and configurations.

## Code Structure

The script is organized into multiple `@app.cell` functions, each responsible for a specific part of the chart creation and display process. These functions are executed in sequence when the Marimo application runs. The script uses the Marimo framework to manage UI components and Altair for chart rendering. The functions are interconnected, with data and configurations being passed between them to build and display the charts.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
The `app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which serves as the main application object for the Marimo framework. It is configured with a full-width display.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a cell in the Marimo application. Each cell represents a unit of computation or UI rendering, and they are executed in the order they appear in the script.

### `__()`
#### Description
This is a placeholder function name used for multiple cells. Each occurrence of `__()` serves a different purpose, such as importing libraries, loading datasets, configuring UI elements, or creating and displaying charts.

#### Inputs and Outputs
The inputs and outputs vary for each occurrence of `__()`. Generally, inputs include data objects, configuration values, and UI components, while outputs are typically chart objects or UI elements.

#### Internal Logic
- **Data Loading**: Some cells load datasets from `vega_datasets` and return them for use in chart creation.
- **UI Configuration**: Cells configure UI elements like radio buttons for selecting chart options.
- **Chart Creation**: Cells use Altair to create charts based on the data and configurations provided.
- **Chart Display**: Cells use Marimo's UI components to display the charts and any associated data or selections.

## References

- **Marimo Framework**: The script heavily relies on the Marimo framework for managing the application and UI components.
- **Altair Library**: Used for creating and rendering charts.
- **Vega Datasets**: Provides the datasets used in the charts.

## Dependencies

| Dependency     | Purpose                                      |
|:---------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| `marimo`       | Framework for building interactive applications. |
| `altair`       | Library for declarative statistical visualization. |
| `vega_datasets`| Provides example datasets for visualization. |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that all operations, such as data loading and chart rendering, will succeed. Any errors would likely result in exceptions being raised by the underlying libraries.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms. It is designed to run interactively within the Marimo framework, which may handle logging or output display internally.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API. It is intended to be run as a standalone Marimo application, with user interaction occurring through the UI components defined in the cells.

## TODOs

There are no explicit TODOs or notes left in the code. The script appears to be a complete example of using Marimo and Altair to create interactive charts.
