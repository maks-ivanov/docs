## High-level description

The target file `altair_brush.py` is a smoke test script for the Marimo framework, which demonstrates the use of Altair, a declarative statistical visualization library for Python. The script creates interactive visualizations using Altair's selection interval feature to allow users to brush over data points and see detailed views. It uses the Marimo framework to structure the application and manage the UI components.

## Code Structure

The script is structured using the Marimo framework's `App` class, which organizes the code into cells. Each cell is a function decorated with `@app.cell`, and these cells are executed in sequence when the application runs. The script imports necessary libraries, creates a dataset, and then builds interactive visualizations using Altair. The visualizations are displayed using Marimo's UI components.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
An instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to define and run the application. It manages the layout and execution of the cells in the script.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
A decorator provided by the Marimo framework that designates a function as a cell in the application. Each cell can contain code to be executed, and the results can be used in subsequent cells.

### `__()`
#### Description
Multiple functions are defined with the name `__`, each serving as a cell in the Marimo application. These functions perform various tasks such as importing libraries, creating data, and building visualizations.

#### Inputs
The inputs vary depending on the specific cell, but they generally include:
- `mo`: An instance of the Marimo framework, used for UI operations.
- `alt`: The Altair library, used for creating visualizations.
- `traces`: A Pandas DataFrame containing the data to be visualized.

#### Outputs
The outputs also vary, but they typically include:
- `alt`: The Altair library.
- `data`: A dictionary containing the generated data.
- `mo`: The Marimo instance.
- `np`: The NumPy library.
- `pd`: The Pandas library.
- `traces`: The DataFrame with the data.
- `chart_detail`, `chart_overview`: Altair chart objects.

#### Internal Logic
- **Data Creation**: A DataFrame is created using NumPy and Pandas, containing random data for visualization.
- **Visualization**: Altair is used to create interactive line charts. A selection interval (`_brush`) is defined to allow users to select data points on the x-axis.
- **UI Integration**: The charts are integrated into the Marimo UI using `mo.ui.altair_chart`, allowing for interactive exploration of the data.

## Side Effects
- The script prints the head of the DataFrame to the console.
- It modifies the UI state by displaying interactive charts.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Framework for building interactive applications. |
| `pandas` | Data manipulation and analysis library. |
| `numpy` | Library for numerical computations. |
| `altair` | Declarative statistical visualization library. |

## Error Handling
The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It assumes that all operations, such as data creation and visualization, will succeed without errors.

## Logging
There is no logging implemented in the script. The only output to the console is the print statement for the DataFrame head.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application using the Marimo framework.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
