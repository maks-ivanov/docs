## High-level description

The `marimo/_smoke_tests/altair` directory contains smoke test scripts for the Marimo framework, demonstrating the integration of Altair, a declarative statistical visualization library for Python. These scripts showcase the creation of interactive visualizations using Altair's capabilities, structured as standalone applications using the Marimo framework. The main components within this directory include scripts for creating interactive visualizations with brushing features, various chart types, and geospatial data visualizations.

## What does it do?

The scripts in this directory are designed to demonstrate how to build interactive data visualizations using the Marimo framework and Altair library. Each script serves as a standalone application that showcases different aspects of data visualization:

1. **Interactive Brushing**: The `altair_brush.py` script allows users to interact with data points by brushing over them. This interaction provides detailed views of the selected data, enhancing the user's ability to explore and analyze the dataset.

2. **Chart Variety and Configuration**: The `altair_charts.py` script demonstrates the creation of various types of charts using Altair. It includes interactive UI elements that let users select different chart configurations, such as selection types and themes, to customize the visualizations.

3. **Geospatial Visualization**: The `altair_geoshape.py` script focuses on visualizing geospatial data. It fetches and processes geospatial datasets, then uses Altair's geoshape capabilities to render maps, allowing users to explore geographical data visually.

Each script is structured using the Marimo framework's `App` class, which organizes the code into cells. These cells are functions decorated with `@app.cell`, executed in sequence to build and display the visualizations. The Marimo framework manages the UI components, providing an interactive experience for users.

## Entry points

The directory contains three main scripts, each serving as an entry point for different types of visualizations:

- **`altair_brush.py`**: This script is the entry point for creating interactive visualizations with brushing features. It demonstrates how to use Altair's selection interval to allow users to interact with data points.

- **`altair_charts.py`**: This script serves as the entry point for exploring various chart types and configurations. It leverages datasets from the `vega_datasets` library and provides UI elements for user interaction.

- **`altair_geoshape.py`**: This script is the entry point for geospatial data visualization. It fetches and processes geospatial data, then visualizes it using Altair's geoshape charting capabilities.

## Key Files

- **`altair_brush.py`**: Demonstrates interactive brushing with Altair, using the Marimo framework to structure the application and manage UI components.

- **`altair_charts.py`**: Showcases different types of Altair charts, with interactive UI elements for selecting chart configurations.

- **`altair_geoshape.py`**: Focuses on geospatial data visualization, using Altair's geoshape capabilities to render maps.

## Dependencies

The scripts in this directory rely on several external libraries:

- **`marimo`**: A framework for building interactive applications, used to structure the scripts and manage UI components.

- **`altair`**: A declarative statistical visualization library, chosen for its ability to create interactive and expressive visualizations.

- **`pandas`**: A data manipulation and analysis library, used for handling datasets.

- **`numpy`**: A library for numerical computations, used for data creation and manipulation.

- **`vega_datasets`**: Provides example datasets for visualization, used in the `altair_charts.py` and `altair_geoshape.py` scripts.

- **`geopandas`**: Used in `altair_geoshape.py` for handling geospatial data, enabling the processing and visualization of geographical datasets.
