title: "full_width.py"

## High-level description

The code in the target file is a smoke test for a UI application built using the Marimo framework. It demonstrates the use of various UI components, such as checkboxes, text inputs, number inputs, dropdowns, and buttons, with a focus on testing their "full width" property. The application allows users to toggle the full width of these components using a checkbox.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the `marimo.App` class, which is used to define a series of UI components within cells. Each cell is a function decorated with `@app.cell`, and these functions define different UI elements that are rendered in the application. The components are interconnected through the `checkbox` variable, which controls the `full_width` property of each UI element.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object. It is used to define and run the UI application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a cell in the Marimo application. Each cell represents a UI component or a group of components that are rendered in the application.

### `__()`
#### Description
Multiple functions are defined with the name `__`, each decorated with `@app.cell`. These functions define various UI components and their properties.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The Marimo module, used to access UI components. |
| checkbox | UI component | A checkbox UI component that controls the `full_width` property of other components. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | tuple | A tuple containing the UI component(s) defined in the cell. |

#### Internal Logic
- The first cell imports the Marimo module and returns it.
- The second cell creates a checkbox labeled "Full width" and calls its `callout` method.
- Subsequent cells create various UI components (text, text area, number input, dropdown, multiselect, date, button) with their `full_width` property tied to the checkbox's value.
- Two additional cells demonstrate the use of `hstack` and `vstack` to layout text inputs horizontally and vertically, respectively.

## Side Effects

- The code modifies the UI state by creating and configuring UI components.
- The checkbox's value affects the layout of other components, demonstrating dynamic UI behavior.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Provides the framework and UI components for building the application. |

## TODOs

- There is a comment in the code questioning the behavior of the `hstack` layout: `# Is this the behavior we want?`. This suggests a potential area for further review or testing.

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the Marimo framework will manage any exceptions related to UI rendering or interaction.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.
