## High-level description
The target file `raise_exception_on_change.py` is a smoke test script for the Marimo framework. It defines a simple application that creates a UI slider component. The script is designed to raise a `ValueError` whenever the slider's value changes, serving as a test to ensure that exceptions are properly handled within the Marimo framework.

## Code Structure
The code is structured using the Marimo framework's `@app.cell` decorator, which is used to define individual components or cells of the application. The script consists of three main cells: one for importing the Marimo module, one for defining an error function, and one for creating a slider UI component that triggers the error function on value change.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which represents the application being defined. It is used to register cells and run the application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. Each cell can contain logic or UI components and can return values that are used by other cells.

### `__()`
#### Description
This is an anonymous function defined using the `@app.cell` decorator. It is used multiple times in the script to define different parts of the application.

#### Inputs
- None for the first two cells.
- For the third cell: `error`, `mo` (imported Marimo module).

#### Outputs
- First cell: Returns the imported Marimo module.
- Second cell: Returns the `error` function.
- Third cell: Returns the slider component.

#### Internal Logic
- **First Cell**: Imports the Marimo module and returns it.
- **Second Cell**: Defines an `error` function that raises a `ValueError` with the provided value as the message.
- **Third Cell**: Creates a slider UI component using Marimo's UI library. The slider's `on_change` event is linked to the `error` function, causing a `ValueError` to be raised whenever the slider's value changes.

## Side Effects
- The script raises a `ValueError` whenever the slider's value changes, which is the intended behavior for testing purposes.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Used to create and manage the application and UI components. |

## Error Handling
The script intentionally raises a `ValueError` when the slider's value changes. This is a part of the test to ensure that the Marimo framework can handle exceptions properly.

## Logging
No explicit logging is implemented in the script. The focus is on raising an exception to test error handling.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose any API or public interface. It is a standalone test script meant to be run directly.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code. The script is complete for its intended purpose as a smoke test.
