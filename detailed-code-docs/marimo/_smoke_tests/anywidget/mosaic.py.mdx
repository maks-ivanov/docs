title: "mosaic.py"
---

## High-level description
The target file `mosaic.py` is a script designed to create a Marimo application that utilizes a custom widget, `MosaicWidget`, to visualize weather data from a CSV file. The script reads a weather dataset, processes it using Pandas, and configures the widget with specifications loaded from a YAML file. The application is then run using the Marimo framework.

## Code Structure
The main components of the code are:
- The `marimo.App` instance, which serves as the application framework.
- Two decorated functions (`@app.cell`) that define the behavior of the application.
- The use of external libraries such as Pandas and YAML for data manipulation and configuration.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App` that serves as the main application object. It is configured with a medium width and is responsible for managing the lifecycle of the application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define functions that are executed as part of the Marimo application. Each decorated function represents a cell in the application, which can perform specific tasks such as data processing or UI updates.

### `__(__file__)`
#### Description
This function is responsible for loading and processing the weather data, as well as configuring the `MosaicWidget` with the appropriate specifications.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `__file__` | str | The path to the current file, used to locate the YAML configuration file. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `MosaicWidget` | class | The class reference for the widget. |
| `dir_path` | str | The directory path of the current file. |
| `f` | file object | The file object for the opened YAML file. |
| `mo` | module | The imported Marimo module. |
| `os` | module | The imported OS module. |
| `pd` | module | The imported Pandas module. |
| `spec` | dict | The loaded widget specification from the YAML file. |
| `w` | object | The instantiated `MosaicWidget` with data. |
| `weather` | DataFrame | The Pandas DataFrame containing the weather data. |
| `yaml` | module | The imported YAML module. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Import necessary modules: Pandas, Marimo, OS, and YAML.
2. Determine the directory path of the current file.
3. Import the `MosaicWidget` class from `mosaic_widget`.
4. Load the weather data from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
5. Open and read the YAML configuration file, removing the "data" key to ensure data is loaded from Pandas.
6. Instantiate the `MosaicWidget` with the loaded specifications and weather data.
7. Return the relevant objects and data for further use.

### `__(w)`
#### Description
This function is a placeholder that simply returns the widget `w`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `w` | object | The instantiated `MosaicWidget`. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `w` | object | The same widget object passed as input. |

## References
- `MosaicWidget`: A custom widget class imported from `mosaic_widget`, used for visualizing the weather data.
- `marimo.App`: The application framework used to create and manage the Marimo application.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Provides the application framework and UI components. |
| `pandas` | Used for data manipulation and processing of the weather dataset. |
| `yaml` | Used to load configuration specifications from a YAML file. |
| `os` | Used to determine the directory path of the current file. |

## Error Handling
The code does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the CSV file and YAML file are accessible and correctly formatted. Any issues with file access or data parsing would raise exceptions.

## Logging
The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.
