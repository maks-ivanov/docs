title: "weather.yaml"
---

## High-level description

The `weather.yaml` file is a configuration file for a visualization or plotting tool, likely using a library like Altair or Vega-Lite, which is integrated into the Marimo framework. It defines a set of visualizations for weather data, specifically focusing on Seattle weather, using a combination of dot and bar plots. The configuration specifies data sources, parameters for interactivity, and visual properties such as colors and dimensions.

## Code Structure

The YAML file is structured into several sections:

- **Data**: Specifies the data source, which is a Parquet file containing Seattle weather data.
- **Params**: Defines interactive parameters such as click selection and domain values for weather conditions.
- **VConcat and HConcat**: These sections define the layout of the plots, using vertical and horizontal concatenation to arrange multiple plots.
- **Plot Specifications**: Each plot is defined with specific marks (dot, barX), data bindings, and visual properties like color and size.

## Symbols

### Data
#### Description
The `data` section specifies the source of the weather data used in the plots. It points to a Parquet file containing the data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| weather | file | Path to the Parquet file containing Seattle weather data. |

#### Outputs
This section does not produce outputs directly but serves as a reference for data used in plots.

### Params
#### Description
The `params` section defines interactive parameters for the plots, such as selection types and color domains.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| click | select | Defines the selection type for interactivity. |
| domain | list | Specifies the weather conditions to be used as categories. |
| colors | list | Defines the color scheme for different weather conditions. |

#### Outputs
This section configures the interactivity and appearance of the plots.

### VConcat and HConcat
#### Description
These sections define the layout of the plots using vertical and horizontal concatenation, allowing multiple plots to be displayed together.

#### Internal Logic
- **VConcat**: Contains a horizontal concatenation (`hconcat`) of plots.
- **HConcat**: Contains individual plot specifications, each with its own data and visual properties.

### Plot
#### Description
Each `plot` entry defines a specific visualization, including the type of mark (e.g., dot, barX), data bindings, and visual properties.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mark | string | Type of mark used in the plot (e.g., dot, barX). |
| data | object | Data source and filters applied to the plot. |
| x, y | object | Axes definitions, including data fields and transformations. |
| fill, r | object | Visual properties like color and size. |

#### Outputs
Each plot renders a specific visualization based on the defined properties and data.

#### Internal Logic
- **Mark Definitions**: Specify the type of visualization (e.g., dot, barX) and its properties.
- **Data Binding**: Connects the plot to the data source and applies filters.
- **Interactivity**: Uses selections and highlights to enable user interaction with the plots.

## References

- The file references a Parquet data file located at `data/seattle-weather.parquet`.
- It uses interactive selection mechanisms, which are likely supported by the Marimo framework or a plotting library like Altair.

## Dependencies

The file implicitly depends on a plotting library that supports YAML configuration for visualizations, such as Altair or Vega-Lite, integrated within the Marimo framework.

## Error Handling

The YAML file itself does not include error handling mechanisms. Any errors related to data loading or visualization rendering would need to be handled by the underlying framework or application using this configuration.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented within this YAML configuration file. Any logging would be handled by the application or framework that processes this configuration.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
