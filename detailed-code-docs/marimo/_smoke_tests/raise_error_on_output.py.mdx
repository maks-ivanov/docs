## High-level description
The code in the target file is a smoke test for the Marimo framework, designed to verify that the application can handle errors raised during the execution of a cell. It defines a simple application with a sequence of cells, where one of the cells intentionally raises a `ValueError` to test the error handling capabilities of the framework.

## Code Structure
The code is structured around the Marimo framework, using the `marimo.App` class to define an application. The application consists of three cells, each defined with the `@app.cell` decorator. These cells are executed in sequence, with the first cell defining a class that raises an error, the second cell instantiating this class, and the third cell simply referencing the instance.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to define and run the application. It serves as the main entry point for the application logic, managing the execution of the defined cells.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. Each decorated function represents a cell that is executed in sequence when the application runs.

### `Mischief`
#### Description
The `Mischief` class is defined within the first cell. It contains a method `_mime_` that raises a `ValueError` with the message "error!". This is used to test the application's ability to handle errors during cell execution.

#### Internal Logic
- The `_mime_` method is defined to raise a `ValueError` when called. This is the key logic for testing error handling.

### `__` (First Cell)
#### Description
The first cell defines the `Mischief` class and returns it as a tuple. This cell is responsible for setting up the class that will later be instantiated and used to raise an error.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Mischief | tuple | A tuple containing the `Mischief` class |

### `__` (Second Cell)
#### Description
The second cell takes the `Mischief` class as input, creates an instance of it, and returns the instance. This cell prepares the instance that will be used in the next cell.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Mischief | class | The `Mischief` class defined in the first cell |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mischief | Mischief | An instance of the `Mischief` class |

### `__` (Third Cell)
#### Description
The third cell takes the `mischief` instance as input and simply references it without performing any operations. This cell completes the sequence of operations defined in the application.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mischief | Mischief | An instance of the `Mischief` class |

## Side Effects
- The first cell raises a `ValueError` when the `_mime_` method of the `Mischief` class is called. This is an intentional side effect to test error handling.

## Error Handling
The code is designed to test error handling by raising a `ValueError` in the `_mime_` method of the `Mischief` class. The Marimo framework is expected to handle this error gracefully during the execution of the application.

## Logging
There is no explicit logging implemented in the code. The focus is on testing error handling through the raised exception.

## API/Interface Reference
The code does not define an API or public interface. It is a standalone script intended for testing purposes.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
