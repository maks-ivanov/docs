## High-level description

The target file `pdb_test.py` is a smoke test script for the Marimo framework, specifically testing the integration of the Python Debugger (PDB) within a Marimo application. It defines a simple Marimo application with two cells, one of which sets a breakpoint using PDB to allow for interactive debugging. The script is designed to be run as a standalone application.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the Marimo framework, which uses the concept of "cells" to define discrete units of functionality within an application. The script defines two cells using the `@app.cell` decorator, which are executed in sequence when the application runs. The first cell imports the Marimo module, and the second cell sets a PDB breakpoint.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which represents the Marimo application. It is used to define and manage the execution of cells within the application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. Each decorated function represents a cell that can contain any logic or operations to be executed as part of the application.

### `__()`
#### Description
This is an anonymous function (using the name `__`) defined as a cell within the Marimo application. It imports the Marimo module and returns it.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The imported Marimo module |

### `__()`
#### Description
This is another anonymous function defined as a cell within the Marimo application. It sets a PDB breakpoint using the `set_trace` method from the Marimo module.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The Marimo module, imported in the previous cell |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- The function calls `mo.pdb.set_trace()`, which triggers the PDB debugger to pause execution and allow for interactive debugging.

## Side Effects

- The second cell, when executed, will pause the program execution and open an interactive PDB session. This allows the user to inspect the program state and step through the code.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | The main framework used to define and run the application and its cells. |

## Error Handling

The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. Any errors during the execution of the cells would be handled by the default Python exception handling.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose any API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
