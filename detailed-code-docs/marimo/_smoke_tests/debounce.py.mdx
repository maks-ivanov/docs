## High-level description

The target file `debounce.py` is a smoke test script for the Marimo framework, specifically testing the debounce functionality of UI components. It creates a simple application with sliders and number inputs, both with and without debouncing, and displays their values in a markdown format.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the `marimo.App` class, which is used to define a series of cells. Each cell is a function decorated with `@app.cell`, and these functions are executed in sequence when the application runs. The main symbols in the code are the UI components (sliders and numbers) and the markdown rendering of their values.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to define and run the application. It manages the lifecycle of the application and the execution of the cells.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a cell in the Marimo application. Each cell represents a unit of work that can be executed independently.

### `__()`
#### Description
There are multiple functions named `__()` in the script, each decorated with `@app.cell`. These functions define the UI components and their behavior.

#### Inputs
- The first `__()` function imports the `marimo` module.
- The second `__()` function takes `mo` (the imported `marimo` module) as input and creates UI components.
- The subsequent `__()` functions take the UI components as inputs to render their values.

#### Outputs
- The first `__()` function returns the `marimo` module.
- The second `__()` function returns the created UI components.
- The subsequent `__()` functions do not return any values; they render markdown content.

#### Internal Logic
- The first `__()` function simply imports and returns the `marimo` module.
- The second `__()` function creates sliders and number inputs, both with and without debouncing, and returns them.
- The subsequent `__()` functions use the `mo.md()` method to render markdown content displaying the UI components and their current values.

## Side Effects

- The script modifies the UI by creating sliders and number inputs.
- It renders markdown content to display the current values of these UI components.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Used to create and manage the UI components and application lifecycle. |

## Error Handling

The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the Marimo framework will handle any exceptions that occur during the execution of the cells.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is a standalone application script intended for testing purposes.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
