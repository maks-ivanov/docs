## High-level description

The target file `marimo/_smoke_tests/buttons.py` is a script designed to test the button UI components of the Marimo framework. It creates an application instance and defines a series of UI cells that render buttons with different styles and states (enabled and disabled). The script is intended to be run as a standalone application to visually verify the appearance and behavior of these buttons.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the `marimo.App` class, which is used to create an application instance. The application is composed of several cells, each defined by the `@app.cell` decorator. These cells are responsible for importing necessary modules, creating button components with different styles, and rendering them in a vertical stack.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class. It serves as the main application object that manages the lifecycle and execution of the UI components defined in the script.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. Each cell is a function that contributes to the UI by performing specific tasks, such as importing modules or creating UI components.

### `__()`
#### Description
There are multiple functions named `__()` in the script, each serving a different purpose within the application. These functions are decorated with `@app.cell` and are executed in sequence to build the UI.

#### Inputs
- The first `__()` function takes no inputs and imports the `marimo` module.
- The second `__()` function takes `mo` (the imported `marimo` module) as input.
- The third `__()` function takes `kinds` (a list of button styles) and `mo` as inputs.

#### Outputs
- The first `__()` function outputs the `marimo` module.
- The second `__()` function outputs a list of button styles (`kinds`).
- The third `__()` function has no outputs.

#### Internal Logic
- The first `__()` function simply imports the `marimo` module and returns it.
- The second `__()` function creates a list of button styles (`kinds`) and uses a list comprehension to create a vertical stack of buttons with these styles using `mo.vstack`.
- The third `__()` function creates a vertical stack of disabled buttons with the same styles as in the second function.

## Side Effects

- The script modifies the UI state by creating and rendering button components within the Marimo application.
- It does not modify any global state or external resources outside of the UI context.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Used to create and manage the UI components and application lifecycle. |

## Error Handling

The script does not implement any specific error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the Marimo framework will handle any exceptions that occur during the execution of the application.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose any API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application for testing purposes.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
