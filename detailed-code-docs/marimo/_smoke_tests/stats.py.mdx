## High-level description

The target file `marimo/_smoke_tests/stats.py` is a script designed to test the functionality of the `marimo` library, specifically focusing on the creation and display of statistical data using the library's components. It defines a series of cells that create and display statistics with different configurations, such as labels, captions, and visual styles, and then runs the application to render these statistics.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the `marimo.App` framework, which uses the `@app.cell` decorator to define executable cells. Each cell is a function that performs a specific task, such as importing modules or creating and displaying statistics. The cells are executed in sequence when the application runs.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which serves as the main application object. It is used to define and manage the execution of cells within the script.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a cell within the `marimo` application. Each cell can perform a specific task, such as importing modules or creating UI components.

### `__()`
#### Description
This is a placeholder function name used for multiple cells. Each instance of `__()` serves a different purpose depending on its context within the script.

#### Inputs
- The first `__()` cell has no inputs.
- The second `__()` cell takes `mo` (the `marimo` module) as input.
- The third `__()` cell also takes `mo` as input.

#### Outputs
- The first `__()` cell returns the `marimo` module.
- The second and third `__()` cells do not return any values.

#### Internal Logic
- The first `__()` cell imports the `marimo` module and returns it.
- The second `__()` cell creates a list of statistics using `mo.stat` and displays them using `mo.hstack`.
- The third `__()` cell creates a similar list of statistics but with additional styling options and displays them with specific layout parameters.

## References

- `marimo.App`: The main application framework used to define and run the script.
- `mo.stat`: A function from the `marimo` module used to create statistical data components.
- `mo.hstack`: A function from the `marimo` module used to horizontally stack UI components.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Provides the application framework and UI components for creating and displaying statistics. |

## Error Handling

The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It relies on the `marimo` framework to manage any exceptions that may occur during the execution of cells.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application for testing purposes.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
