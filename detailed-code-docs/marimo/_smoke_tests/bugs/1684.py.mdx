title: "1684.py"

## High-level description
The target file is a Python script designed to run a smoke test for a specific bug (bug 1684) in the Marimo application framework. It defines a Marimo application with a medium width and includes two cells: one that renders a mathematical expression using Markdown and another that imports the Marimo module.

## Code Structure
The script is structured around the Marimo application framework. It defines an application instance and two cells within that application. The first cell is responsible for rendering a mathematical expression, while the second cell imports the Marimo module. The script is executed by running the application if the file is executed as the main program.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which represents a Marimo application. It is initialized with a width parameter set to "medium".

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| width | str | The width of the application, set to "medium". |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| app | marimo.App | An instance of the Marimo application. |

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. Each cell can contain a function that performs specific tasks, such as rendering content or executing code.

#### Internal Logic
- The first cell function renders a mathematical expression using Markdown syntax.
- The second cell function imports the Marimo module and returns it.

### `__`
#### Description
The function `__` is defined twice, each time serving a different purpose within the Marimo application cells.

#### First `__` Function
- **Purpose**: Renders a mathematical expression using Markdown.
- **Inputs**: 
  - `mo`: An instance of the Marimo module.
- **Outputs**: None.
- **Internal Logic**: Uses the `mo.md` method to render a LaTeX-style mathematical expression.

#### Second `__` Function
- **Purpose**: Imports the Marimo module.
- **Inputs**: None.
- **Outputs**: 
  - A tuple containing the Marimo module.
- **Internal Logic**: Imports the Marimo module and returns it as a tuple.

## Side Effects
- The first `__` function renders a mathematical expression, which is a side effect of using the `mo.md` method.
- The second `__` function imports the Marimo module, which is a side effect of the import statement.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Used to create and manage the Marimo application and its cells. |

## Error Handling
The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It relies on the Marimo framework to manage any errors that occur during the execution of the application.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone script for testing purposes.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
