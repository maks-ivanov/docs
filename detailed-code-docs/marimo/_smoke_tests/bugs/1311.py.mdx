title: "1311.py"
---

## High-level description
The target file is a script designed to perform smoke tests for a specific bug (bug 1311) in the Marimo application framework. It utilizes the Marimo framework to create an application that loads a large dataset of flight information from a remote Parquet file, displays the entire dataset, and then displays a subset of the dataset (the first 10 rows) using Marimo's UI table functionality.

## Code Structure
The code is structured around the Marimo application framework, which uses a decorator-based approach to define application cells. Each cell is a function that performs a specific task, such as importing libraries, loading data, or displaying data. The functions are executed in sequence when the application runs.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object. It is used to define and run the application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. Each decorated function represents a cell that performs a specific task.

### `__()`
#### Description
There are multiple functions named `__()` in the script, each serving a different purpose. These functions are defined as cells in the Marimo application.

#### Inputs and Outputs
1. **First `__()` function:**
   - **Inputs:** None
   - **Outputs:** A tuple containing the `marimo` and `pandas` modules.

2. **Second `__()` function:**
   - **Inputs:** `pd` (the `pandas` module)
   - **Outputs:** A tuple containing the `all_flights` DataFrame.

3. **Third `__()` function:**
   - **Inputs:** `all_flights` (DataFrame), `mo` (the `marimo` module)
   - **Outputs:** None
   - **Internal Logic:** Displays the entire `all_flights` DataFrame using Marimo's UI table.

4. **Fourth `__()` function:**
   - **Inputs:** `all_flights` (DataFrame), `mo` (the `marimo` module)
   - **Outputs:** None
   - **Internal Logic:** Displays the first 10 rows of the `all_flights` DataFrame using Marimo's UI table.

### `app.run()`
#### Description
The `app.run()` method is called to execute the application, running all defined cells in sequence.

## References
- **`marimo`**: The main framework used to create and run the application.
- **`pandas`**: A data manipulation library used to load and handle the flight data.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Used to create and manage the application and its UI components. |
| `pandas` | Used to load and manipulate the flight data from a Parquet file. |

## Error Handling
The script does not explicitly handle errors. Any issues with loading the data or displaying it would likely result in exceptions being raised by the underlying libraries (`pandas` or `marimo`).

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose any API or public interface. It is a standalone application script intended to be run directly.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
