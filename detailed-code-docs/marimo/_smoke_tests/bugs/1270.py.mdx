## High-level description
The target file is a smoke test script for the Marimo framework, specifically addressing a bug identified as 1270. It defines a simple Marimo application that uses the Polars library to create a DataFrame, perform a group-by operation, and apply a transformation to each group. The script is designed to verify that the specified functionality works as expected without errors.

## Code Structure
The script is structured around a Marimo application instance, `app`, which is used to define a cell function. This function imports necessary libraries, performs operations on a DataFrame, and returns the imported modules. The script is executed by running the Marimo application.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to define and run a Marimo application. It serves as the main entry point for the application logic.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell function within the Marimo application. This function encapsulates the logic to be executed as part of the application.

### `__()`
#### Description
The `__()` function is a cell function defined within the Marimo application. It imports the Marimo and Polars libraries, creates a DataFrame, performs a group-by operation, and applies a transformation to each group.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | N/A  | The function does not take any parameters. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo   | module | The imported Marimo module. |
| pl   | module | The imported Polars module. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Import the Marimo library as `mo` and the Polars library as `pl`.
2. Create a Polars DataFrame with columns 'num' and 'x'.
3. Perform a group-by operation on the 'num' column.
4. Apply a transformation to each group using `map_groups`, which replaces the group data with a new DataFrame containing the integer 123.
5. Return the imported modules `mo` and `pl`.

### `if __name__ == "__main__":`
#### Description
This conditional block checks if the script is being run as the main program and, if so, executes the Marimo application by calling `app.run()`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo    | Used to create and run the Marimo application. |
| polars    | Used for DataFrame operations, including group-by and transformation. |

## Error Handling
The script does not explicitly handle errors. It relies on the underlying libraries (Marimo and Polars) to manage any exceptions that may occur during execution.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
