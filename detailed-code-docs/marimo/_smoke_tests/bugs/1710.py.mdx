## High-level description

The target file is a smoke test script for the Marimo framework, specifically testing a bug or feature related to the use of Keras models within a Marimo application. It defines a simple neural network model using Keras, visualizes the model architecture, and integrates it into a Marimo application cell. The script is designed to be executed as a standalone application using Marimo's app framework.

## Code Structure

The main components of the code are:
- The `marimo.App` instance, which serves as the application framework.
- A single application cell defined using the `@app.cell` decorator, which contains the logic for creating and visualizing a Keras model.
- The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, which runs the application when the script is executed directly.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App` that serves as the main application framework for the script. It is configured with a medium width layout.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. This cell contains the logic for creating a Keras model and visualizing it.

### `__()`
#### Description
This function is the main cell of the Marimo application. It creates a simple Keras neural network model, visualizes it, and returns several objects.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name  | Type   | Description                                      |
|:------|:-------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| keras | module | The Keras module used for building the model.    |
| mo    | module | The Marimo module, imported as `mo`.             |
| model | object | The Keras model instance created in the cell.    |
| os    | module | The OS module, imported for potential use.       |

#### Internal Logic
1. Import necessary modules: `marimo` as `mo`, `os`, and `keras`.
2. Create a Keras Sequential model.
3. Add an input layer with a shape of `(1,)`.
4. Add a dense layer with 2 units and ReLU activation.
5. Add a dense layer with 1 unit and sigmoid activation.
6. Visualize the model using `keras.utils.plot_model`.
7. Return the Keras module, Marimo module, model instance, and OS module.

### `if __name__ == "__main__":`
#### Description
This block checks if the script is being run directly and, if so, executes the Marimo application by calling `app.run()`.

## References

- The script references the `marimo` module for creating the application and defining cells.
- The `keras` module is used for building and visualizing the neural network model.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose                                      |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------------|
| marimo    | Provides the application framework and UI components. |
| keras     | Used for building and visualizing the neural network model. |
| os        | Imported for potential use, though not explicitly used in the logic. |

## Error Handling

The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It relies on the default behavior of the imported libraries and the Python runtime to handle any exceptions that may occur.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms. It focuses on defining and running a simple Marimo application with a Keras model.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
