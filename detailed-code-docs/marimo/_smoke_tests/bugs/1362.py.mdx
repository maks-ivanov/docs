## High-level description
The code in the target file is a smoke test script for the Marimo framework, which is used to define and run a series of computational cells within an application. The script defines three cells, each performing simple operations, and then runs the application. The primary purpose is to test the basic functionality of the Marimo framework's cell execution and data flow between cells.

## Code Structure
The code is structured around the `marimo.App` class, which is used to create an application instance. This instance is decorated with the `@app.cell` decorator to define computational cells. Each cell is a function that performs a specific operation and can pass data to subsequent cells.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object for defining and running cells.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. A cell is a function that performs a computation and can pass its output to other cells.

### `__()`
#### Description
This is the first cell function, which initializes a variable `qwerty` with the value 10 and returns it as a tuple.

#### Outputs
| Name   | Type | Description          |
|:-------|:-----|:---------------------|
| qwerty | int  | The integer value 10 |

### `__(qwerty)`
#### Description
This is the second cell function, which takes the output from the first cell (`qwerty`), formats it into a string with "10" appended, and returns the result as a tuple.

#### Inputs
| Name   | Type | Description          |
|:-------|:-----|:---------------------|
| qwerty | int  | The integer value 10 |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description                |
|:-----|:-----|:---------------------------|
| a    | str  | A string formatted as "10 10" |

### `__(a)`
#### Description
This is the third cell function, which takes the output from the second cell (`a`) and simply returns without performing any operation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description                |
|:-----|:-----|:---------------------------|
| a    | str  | A string formatted as "10 10" |

## Side Effects
- The script runs the Marimo application when executed as a standalone program, which involves executing the defined cells in sequence.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose                          |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------|
| `marimo`   | Provides the framework for defining and running computational cells within an application. |

## Error Handling
The code does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It relies on the Marimo framework to manage any exceptions that may occur during cell execution.

## Logging
The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
