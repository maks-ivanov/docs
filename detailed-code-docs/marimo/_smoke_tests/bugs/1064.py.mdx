## High-level description
The code in the target file is a smoke test script for a Marimo application, specifically addressing issue 1064. It sets up a simple interactive application using the Marimo framework, which includes rendering two scatter plots using Plotly Express and displaying them in a tabbed interface.

## Code Structure
The code is structured using the Marimo framework's `@app.cell` decorator, which defines different cells or components of the application. Each cell is responsible for a specific part of the application, such as importing libraries, rendering markdown, creating plots, setting up UI tabs, and rendering content based on user interaction with the tabs.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which represents the main application. It is initialized with a full-width layout.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define individual components or cells of the Marimo application. Each decorated function represents a cell that can perform specific tasks, such as importing modules, rendering UI elements, or handling user interactions.

### `__()`
#### Description
The `__()` functions are anonymous functions defined using the `@app.cell` decorator. Each function serves a specific purpose within the application, such as importing modules, creating plots, or rendering UI components.

#### Inputs and Outputs
- The first `__()` function imports the `marimo` and `plotly.express` modules and returns them.
- The second `__()` function takes `mo` (the `marimo` module) as input, renders a markdown header, and returns nothing.
- The third `__()` function takes `px` (the `plotly.express` module) as input, creates two scatter plots, and returns them.
- The fourth `__()` function takes `mo` as input, creates a tabbed UI component, and returns it.
- The fifth `__()` function takes `mo`, `plot1`, `plot2`, and `tabs` as inputs, defines a function to render content based on the selected tab, and returns the rendering function.

#### Internal Logic
- The first `__()` function imports necessary modules for the application.
- The second `__()` function uses the `marimo` module to render a markdown header for the issue.
- The third `__()` function uses `plotly.express` to create two scatter plots with predefined data points.
- The fourth `__()` function uses `marimo` to create a tabbed interface with two tabs labeled "Tab 1" and "Tab 2".
- The fifth `__()` function defines a nested function `render_tab_content` that checks the selected tab and returns the corresponding plot. It then uses `marimo` to stack the tabs and the rendered content vertically.

## Side Effects
- The application modifies the UI state by rendering plots and tabs based on user interaction.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Used to create and manage the application and UI components. |
| `plotly.express` | Used to create scatter plots for visualization. |

## Error Handling
The code does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the modules import successfully and that the UI components render without issues.

## Logging
The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The code does not expose an API or public interface. It is a standalone script intended to be run as a smoke test for the Marimo application.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
