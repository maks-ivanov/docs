## High-level description
The code in the target file is a smoke test script for the Marimo application framework. It creates a simple data visualization using the Altair library and the Polars library to handle data. The script defines a function that generates two bar charts with different colors and stacks them vertically using Marimo's visualization capabilities.

## Code Structure
The main components of the code are the Marimo application instance (`app`) and the function decorated with `@app.cell`, which is responsible for creating and displaying the charts. The function utilizes the Polars library to create a DataFrame and the Altair library to generate the charts. The charts are then combined using Marimo's `vstack` function.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to manage the lifecycle of the application and its components.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function that will be executed as part of the Marimo application. This function is responsible for creating and displaying the charts.

### `__()`
#### Description
The function `__()` is decorated with `@app.cell` and is the main function executed by the Marimo application. It creates a DataFrame, generates two bar charts, and stacks them vertically.

#### Inputs
This function does not take any external inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name   | Type          | Description                                      |
|:-------|:--------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| alt    | module        | The Altair module used for chart creation.       |
| chart1 | alt.Chart     | The first bar chart with blue bars.              |
| chart2 | alt.Chart     | The second bar chart with red bars.              |
| counts | pl.DataFrame  | The DataFrame containing the data for the charts.|
| mo     | module        | The Marimo module used for visualization.        |
| pl     | module        | The Polars module used for data manipulation.    |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Data Creation**: A Polars DataFrame `counts` is created with two columns: `category` and `count`.
2. **Chart Creation**: Two bar charts (`chart1` and `chart2`) are created using Altair, each with the same data but different bar colors (blue and red).
3. **Chart Stacking**: The two charts are stacked vertically using Marimo's `vstack` function.
4. **Return Statement**: The function returns the Altair module, the two charts, the DataFrame, and the Marimo and Polars modules.

### `if __name__ == "__main__":`
#### Description
This conditional block checks if the script is being run as the main program and, if so, starts the Marimo application by calling `app.run()`.
