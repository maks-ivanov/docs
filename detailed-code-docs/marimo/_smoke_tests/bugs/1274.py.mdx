title: "1274.py"
---

## High-level description
The target file is a smoke test script for the Marimo framework, specifically testing a bug identified as 1274. It defines an asynchronous cell within a Marimo application that prints a sequence of messages with delays in between, demonstrating the use of asynchronous operations.

## Code Structure
The code is structured around the Marimo framework, utilizing its `App` class to define and run an asynchronous cell. The cell is decorated with `@app.cell`, indicating it is a component of the Marimo application. The script is designed to be executed as a standalone program.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object in the Marimo framework. It is used to define and manage the lifecycle of the application, including the execution of cells.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. A cell is a unit of computation that can be executed asynchronously. In this script, it decorates an anonymous asynchronous function that prints messages with delays.

### `__()`
#### Description
The `__()` function is an anonymous asynchronous function defined as a cell in the Marimo application. It prints a series of messages with a one-second delay between each, demonstrating asynchronous execution.

#### Inputs
This function does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name     | Type       | Description                        |
|:---------|:-----------|:-----------------------------------|
| asyncio  | module     | Returns the asyncio module itself. |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function imports the `asyncio` module.
2. It prints "hello" to the console.
3. It waits for one second using `await asyncio.sleep(1)`.
4. It prints "world" to the console.
5. It waits for another second.
6. It prints "last one" to the console.
7. Finally, it returns the `asyncio` module.

### `app.run()`
#### Description
The `app.run()` method is called to start the Marimo application, which in turn executes the defined cells. This method is invoked only if the script is run as the main module.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose                                      |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------------|
| marimo     | Provides the framework for defining and running the application and its cells. |
| asyncio    | Used for asynchronous operations within the cell. |

## Error Handling
The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. Any exceptions raised during the execution of the asynchronous cell would need to be managed by the Marimo framework or by adding additional error handling code.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms. Output is directly printed to the console using `print` statements.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
