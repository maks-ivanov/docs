## High-level description
The target file is a smoke test script for the Marimo application framework, specifically testing the integration with the Leafmap library. It defines a series of cells using the Marimo framework to create and manipulate a map object from Leafmap, demonstrating the use of custom and built-in formatters for rendering the map.

## Code Structure
The code is structured around the Marimo application framework, which uses decorators to define "cells" that encapsulate specific functionality. Each cell is a function that performs a particular task, such as creating a map or rendering it using different formatters. The script is designed to be executed as a standalone application using `app.run()`.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object for defining and running the Marimo application. It is used to register cells that encapsulate specific functionality.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a "cell" within the Marimo application. Each cell represents a unit of work or a step in the application logic.

### `__()`
#### Description
This function is defined as a cell and is responsible for importing necessary modules and creating a Leafmap map object.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name   | Type   | Description                        |
|:-------|:-------|:-----------------------------------|
| leafmap| module | The Leafmap module for map creation|
| m      | object | A Leafmap map object               |
| mo     | module | The Marimo module                  |

#### Internal Logic
- Imports the `marimo` module as `mo` and the `leafmap.foliumap` module as `leafmap`.
- Creates a `leafmap.Map` object centered at coordinates (40, -100) with a zoom level of 4.
- Returns the `leafmap` module, the map object `m`, and the `mo` module.

### `__(m)`
#### Description
This cell function takes a map object `m` and applies a custom formatter to it.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type  | Description          |
|:-----|:------|:---------------------|
| m    | object| A Leafmap map object |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- The function simply references the map object `m`, indicating the use of a custom formatter, but does not perform any operations or return a value.

### `__(m, mo)`
#### Description
This cell function uses the built-in IPython formatter to render the map object `m`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type   | Description          |
|:-----|:-------|:---------------------|
| m    | object | A Leafmap map object |
| mo   | module | The Marimo module    |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Calls `mo.Html(m._repr_html_())` to render the map object `m` using the built-in IPython HTML formatter.

## Side Effects
- The script, when run, will execute the defined cells in sequence, potentially rendering a map in an IPython environment.

## Dependencies
| Dependency       | Purpose                                      |
|:-----------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| `marimo`         | Framework for defining and running the app   |
| `leafmap.foliumap` | Library for creating interactive maps       |

## Error Handling
The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It relies on the Marimo framework and the Python runtime to handle any exceptions that may occur.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
