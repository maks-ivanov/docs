title: "1086.py"
---

## High-level description
The target file is a smoke test script for the Marimo framework, specifically addressing a bug identified as 1086. It defines a simple application using Marimo, which plots a graph using Matplotlib and NumPy, and then displays it. The script is designed to verify that the plotting functionality works as expected within the Marimo application environment.

## Code Structure
The script is structured around the Marimo framework, utilizing its `App` class to define and run a cell that performs a plotting operation. The main symbols in the code are the `app` instance of `marimo.App` and the cell function defined using the `@app.cell` decorator.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to define and manage the lifecycle of the application. It provides the context in which the cell function is executed.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell function within the Marimo application. This function is executed as part of the application's workflow.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | N/A  | The function does not take any explicit inputs. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| np   | module | The NumPy module, imported within the cell. |
| plt  | module | The Matplotlib `pyplot` module, imported within the cell. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Importing Libraries**: The function imports `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt` and `numpy` as `np`.
2. **Plotting**: It uses `plt.plot()` to create a plot of a range of numbers from 0 to 51.
3. **Displaying the Plot**: The plot is displayed using `plt.show()`.
4. **Return Statement**: The function returns the `np` and `plt` modules.

### `if __name__ == "__main__":`
#### Description
This conditional block checks if the script is being run as the main program and, if so, executes `app.run()` to start the Marimo application.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Provides the framework for defining and running the application. |
| `matplotlib.pyplot` | Used for creating and displaying plots. |
| `numpy`    | Used for numerical operations, specifically to generate a range of numbers for plotting. |

## Side Effects
- The script generates and displays a plot window when executed, which is a side effect of calling `plt.show()`.

## Error Handling
The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It relies on the underlying libraries (`marimo`, `matplotlib`, and `numpy`) to handle any exceptions that may occur during execution.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## TODOs
- There is a comment suggesting that using `plt.gca()` might be a better approach, indicating a potential area for improvement or further investigation.
