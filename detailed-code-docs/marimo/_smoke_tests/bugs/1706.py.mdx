## High-level description
The code in the target file is a set of smoke tests for a bug identified as "1706" in the Marimo application framework. It defines a Marimo application with a medium width and includes three cells that perform operations on a Polars DataFrame, utilizing the Marimo framework to execute and display the results.

## Code Structure
The code is structured around the Marimo application framework, with three main cells defined using the `@app.cell` decorator. Each cell performs specific operations on a Polars DataFrame and utilizes the Marimo framework for execution. The cells are executed in sequence when the application is run.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, initialized with a width parameter set to "medium". It serves as the main application object that manages the execution of the defined cells.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define executable cells within the Marimo application. Each cell is a function that performs specific operations and is managed by the `app` instance.

### First Cell (`__`)
#### Description
This cell creates a Polars DataFrame with a single column 'a', containing arrays of zeros, and returns the DataFrame along with the imported modules.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| df | `pl.DataFrame` | A Polars DataFrame with a single column 'a' containing arrays of zeros. |
| mo | module | The Marimo module. |
| np | module | The NumPy module. |
| pl | module | The Polars module. |

#### Internal Logic
- Imports necessary modules: Marimo, Polars, and NumPy.
- Constructs a Polars DataFrame with a column 'a' containing arrays of zeros.
- Returns the DataFrame and the imported modules.

### Second Cell (`__`)
#### Description
This cell takes the DataFrame and Marimo module as inputs and uses the Marimo `plain` function to display the DataFrame.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| df | `pl.DataFrame` | The Polars DataFrame created in the first cell. |
| mo | module | The Marimo module. |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Calls the `plain` method from the Marimo module to display the DataFrame.

### Third Cell (`__`)
#### Description
This cell retrieves and returns the data type of the first column in the DataFrame.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| df | `pl.DataFrame` | The Polars DataFrame created in the first cell. |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Accesses the first column of the DataFrame and retrieves its data type.

## Side Effects
- The `plain` method from the Marimo module is used to display the DataFrame, which may have side effects related to the display or logging of data.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Used to create and manage the application and its cells. |
| `polars` | Used to create and manipulate the DataFrame. |
| `numpy` | Used to generate arrays of zeros for the DataFrame. |

## Error Handling
The code does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It relies on the underlying libraries (Marimo, Polars, NumPy) to handle any exceptions that may occur.

## Logging
There is no explicit logging implemented in the code. Any logging would be handled by the Marimo framework or the underlying libraries.

## TODOs
None
