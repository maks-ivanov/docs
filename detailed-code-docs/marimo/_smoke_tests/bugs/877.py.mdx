## High-level description
The target file is a Python script designed to run a smoke test using the Marimo framework. It sets up a simple application that integrates with the Altair library for data visualization, specifically enabling a custom data transformer called "marimo_csv". The script is intended to be executed as a standalone application.

## Code Structure
The script primarily consists of a Marimo application setup and a single cell function that configures the Altair library. The `marimo.App` instance is used to define the application, and the `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell function that is executed as part of the application.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which represents the application being created. It is used to define and manage the lifecycle of the application, including the execution of cell functions.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function that will be executed as part of the Marimo application. In this script, it is used to define a single cell function that configures the Altair library.

### `__()`
#### Description
This is an anonymous function (denoted by `__`) decorated with `@app.cell`. It imports the Altair library, enables a custom data transformer called "marimo_csv", and returns the Altair module.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | N/A  | The function does not take any inputs. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| alt | module | The Altair module, after enabling the "marimo_csv" data transformer. |

#### Internal Logic
- The function imports the Altair library as `alt`.
- It enables a custom data transformer named "marimo_csv" using `alt.data_transformers.enable("marimo_csv")`.
- Finally, it returns the `alt` module.

### `if __name__ == "__main__":`
#### Description
This is a standard Python idiom for making a script executable. It checks if the script is being run as the main program and, if so, executes the `app.run()` method to start the Marimo application.

## References
- **Marimo Framework**: The script uses the Marimo framework to define and run the application.
- **Altair Library**: The script imports and configures the Altair library for data visualization.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Used to create and manage the application. |
| `altair`   | Used for data visualization, specifically enabling a custom data transformer. |

## Error Handling
The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It relies on the underlying libraries (Marimo and Altair) to handle any exceptions that may occur during execution.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## Side Effects
- The script modifies the state of the Altair library by enabling a custom data transformer, which may affect how data is processed and visualized within the application.

## Performance Considerations
There are no specific performance considerations mentioned in the script. The performance would largely depend on the efficiency of the Marimo framework and the Altair library when handling data transformations and visualizations.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
