## High-level description

The code in the target file is a smoke test for a Marimo application, specifically designed to test a bug identified as 1271. It defines a simple interactive application using the Marimo framework, which includes a button that increments a counter and displays a spinner or a "Done!" message based on the counter's value.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the Marimo framework's concept of "cells," which are essentially functions that define parts of the application's behavior. Each cell is decorated with `@app.cell`, indicating that it is a component of the Marimo application. The cells interact with each other by passing and receiving parameters, such as the `mo` module and the `counter_button`.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object. It is used to define and run the Marimo application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a "cell" in the Marimo application. Each cell represents a distinct part of the application's logic or UI.

### `__()`
#### Description
This is an unnamed cell function that imports the Marimo module and returns it. It is used to make the Marimo module available to other cells.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The Marimo module |

### `__(mo)`
#### Description
This cell function uses the Marimo module to create a status spinner. The spinner is displayed but does not perform any actions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The Marimo module |

### `__(mo)`
#### Description
This cell function creates a button using the Marimo UI library. The button increments a counter each time it is clicked.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The Marimo module |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| counter_button | object | A button object with an incrementing counter |

### `__(counter_button, mo)`
#### Description
This cell function displays the current value of the counter and a status spinner or a "Done!" message based on the counter's value.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| counter_button | object | The button object with the counter value |
| mo | module | The Marimo module |

## Side Effects

- The code modifies the UI by displaying a button and a spinner or message based on user interaction.
- The spinner's visibility is controlled by the counter's value.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Used to create and manage the application and UI components |

## Error Handling

The code does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It relies on the Marimo framework to manage any exceptions or errors that may occur during execution.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
