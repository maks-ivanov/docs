title: "1545.py"

## High-level description
The target file is a script designed to perform a smoke test for a specific bug (bug 1545) in the Marimo application framework. It utilizes the Marimo framework to create a simple interactive Altair chart with a scatter plot and a line, demonstrating the integration of data visualization and user interaction capabilities.

## Code Structure
The script is structured using the Marimo framework, which organizes code into cells. Each cell is a function decorated with `@app.cell`, allowing for modular execution. The script imports necessary libraries, creates a DataFrame, constructs a scatter plot and a line using Altair, and integrates these visualizations into a Marimo UI component. The script concludes by running the application.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object. It is configured with a full-width display.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. Each cell is a function that performs a specific task, such as importing libraries, creating data structures, or generating visualizations.

### `__()`
#### Description
Multiple functions are defined with the name `__`, each serving a different purpose within the application. These functions are differentiated by their parameters and the tasks they perform.

#### Inputs and Outputs
Each function has different inputs and outputs, depending on its role:
- The first function imports libraries and returns them.
- The second function creates a DataFrame and returns it.
- The third function creates Altair visualizations and returns them.
- The fourth function integrates the visualizations into a Marimo UI component and returns it.
- The fifth function accesses selections from the visualization.
- The sixth function prints the value of the visualization.
- The seventh function applies selections to the DataFrame and prints the result.

#### Internal Logic
- **Library Import**: The first cell imports Altair, Marimo, and Pandas, making them available for subsequent cells.
- **DataFrame Creation**: The second cell constructs a Pandas DataFrame with annotations and coordinates for plotting.
- **Visualization Construction**: The third cell creates a scatter plot and a line using Altair, encoding data from the DataFrame.
- **UI Integration**: The fourth cell layers the scatter plot and line into a Marimo UI component, configuring the visual appearance.
- **Selection Handling**: The fifth and seventh cells interact with the visualization's selections, demonstrating interactivity.
- **Output Display**: The sixth cell prints the visualization's value to the console.

## Side Effects
- The script modifies the global state by creating and manipulating a Marimo application instance and its associated UI components.
- It prints output to the console, which is a side effect of the sixth and seventh cells.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Provides the application framework and UI components. |
| `altair` | Used for creating interactive visualizations. |
| `pandas` | Utilized for data manipulation and DataFrame creation. |

## Error Handling
The script does not explicitly handle errors beyond the basic functionality provided by the Marimo framework and the imported libraries.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose an API or public interface beyond the Marimo application framework's cell-based execution model.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
