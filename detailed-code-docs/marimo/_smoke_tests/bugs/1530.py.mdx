## High-level description

The target file is a smoke test script for the Marimo application framework, specifically testing the handling of DataFrames with special characters in column names. It creates a DataFrame with various special characters in the column names and uses Marimo's UI components to display this DataFrame in different formats, such as a table, a dataframe view, and a data explorer.

## Code Structure

The script is structured using the Marimo framework, which organizes code into "cells" that are executed in sequence. Each cell is decorated with `@app.cell`, indicating that it is a part of the Marimo application. The script imports necessary libraries, creates a DataFrame with special character column names, and then uses Marimo's UI components to display the DataFrame in various ways.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object for the Marimo framework. It is used to define and run the application by organizing code into executable cells.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. Each decorated function represents a cell that can execute a specific piece of logic, such as importing libraries, creating data structures, or rendering UI components.

### `__()`
#### Description
The `__()` functions are anonymous functions (using the name `__`) that are decorated with `@app.cell`. Each function performs a specific task within the application, such as importing libraries, creating a DataFrame, or rendering UI components.

#### Inputs and Outputs
- The first `__()` function imports the `marimo` and `pandas` libraries and returns them.
- The second `__()` function takes `pandas` as input, creates a DataFrame with special character column names, and returns the DataFrame.
- The third `__()` function takes the DataFrame and `marimo` as inputs and uses `marimo.ui.table` to display the DataFrame as a table.
- The fourth `__()` function takes the DataFrame and `marimo` as inputs and uses `marimo.ui.dataframe` to display the DataFrame.
- The fifth `__()` function takes the DataFrame and `marimo` as inputs and uses `marimo.ui.data_explorer` to display the DataFrame in a data explorer format.
- The sixth `__()` function imports the `altair` library and returns it.

## References

- The script references the `marimo` library for creating the application and rendering UI components.
- The `pandas` library is used for creating and manipulating the DataFrame.
- The `altair` library is imported but not used within the script.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Used to create the application and render UI components. |
| `pandas`   | Used to create and manipulate the DataFrame. |
| `altair`   | Imported but not used in the script. |

## Error Handling

The script does not implement specific error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the operations will succeed without exceptions.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is a standalone script intended to be run as a smoke test for the Marimo framework.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
