## High-level description
The code in the target file is a smoke test for a bug identified as "1602" in the Marimo framework. It defines a simple application using the Marimo library, which tests the behavior of a class `Boom` that dynamically handles attribute access. The test checks if an instance of `Boom` can be used in a specific way without causing errors, particularly focusing on the `__dataframe__` attribute.

## Code Structure
The code is structured around the Marimo application framework, utilizing the `@app.cell` decorator to define different stages of the test. Each decorated function represents a cell in the Marimo application, which is executed in sequence. The `Boom` class is defined and tested across these cells.

## Symbols

### `marimo.App`
#### Description
`marimo.App` is a class from the Marimo library used to create an application instance. It is initialized with a width parameter, which in this case is set to "medium".

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell in the Marimo application. Each cell is a function that performs a specific part of the test. The cells are executed in the order they are defined.

### `Boom`
#### Description
The `Boom` class is defined within the first cell. It is designed to handle any attribute access dynamically by returning an ellipsis (`...`) for any attribute requested.

#### Internal Logic
- The `__getattr__` method is overridden to return an ellipsis for any attribute access, which means any attribute accessed on an instance of `Boom` will not raise an `AttributeError` but will instead return `...`.

### First Cell Function
#### Description
This function defines the `Boom` class and returns it as a tuple. It is the first step in the test sequence.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Boom | class | The `Boom` class is returned as a tuple. |

### Second Cell Function
#### Description
This function takes the `Boom` class as input, creates an instance of it, and returns the instance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Boom | class | The `Boom` class from the first cell. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| b | instance | An instance of the `Boom` class. |

### Third Cell Function
#### Description
This function takes an instance of `Boom` and checks if the `__dataframe__` attribute is callable. It does not return any value.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| b | instance | An instance of the `Boom` class. |

#### Internal Logic
- The function attempts to call `b.__dataframe__`, which should not raise an error due to the `__getattr__` method in `Boom`.

## Side Effects
- The code does not have any side effects such as modifying global state or external resources. It is a self-contained test.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Used to create and manage the application and its cells. |

## Error Handling
- The code does not explicitly handle errors. It relies on the dynamic attribute handling of the `Boom` class to prevent `AttributeError`.

## Logging
- There is no logging implemented in this code.

## TODOs
- There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
