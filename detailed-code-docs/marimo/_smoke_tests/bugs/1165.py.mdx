## High-level description

The target file is a Python script that defines a Marimo application with two main components: a custom widget for visualizing genomic data using the IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer) library, and a set of CSS styles to customize the appearance of the widget. The script uses the `marimo` library to create an application and the `anywidget` library to define a custom widget that integrates with the IGV JavaScript library.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around two main functions decorated with `@app.cell`, which are used to define components of the Marimo application. The first function defines a custom widget using the `anywidget` library, and the second function provides CSS styles for the widget. These components are then combined to create a visual representation of genomic data.

## Symbols

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell in the Marimo application. Each cell can contain a function that returns a component or a set of components to be used in the application.

### `IGVWidget`
#### Description
`IGVWidget` is a class that extends `anywidget.AnyWidget` to create a custom widget for visualizing genomic data using the IGV library. It defines the JavaScript and CSS required to render the widget.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| css | str | CSS styles to be applied to the widget. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| IGVWidget | class | The custom widget class for IGV visualization. |
| anywidget | module | The `anywidget` module used for creating widgets. |
| mo | module | The `marimo` module used for the application. |

#### Internal Logic
- The `_esm` attribute contains JavaScript code that imports the IGV library and defines a `render` function to create a browser instance with specific genomic data.
- The `_css` attribute combines the provided CSS with additional styles for the widget.

### `__()`
#### Description
This function returns a string containing CSS styles for the IGV widget. These styles define the appearance of various components of the widget, such as the navigation bar, buttons, and other UI elements.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| css | str | A string containing CSS styles for the widget. |

## References

- The `anywidget` library is used to create custom widgets.
- The `marimo` library is used to define the application and its components.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Used to create and manage the application. |
| anywidget | Used to define custom widgets. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors, but it relies on the robustness of the `marimo` and `anywidget` libraries to manage any issues that arise during widget creation and rendering.

## Logging

There is no explicit logging in the target file, but related code snippets suggest that the `marimo` library may include logging capabilities.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
