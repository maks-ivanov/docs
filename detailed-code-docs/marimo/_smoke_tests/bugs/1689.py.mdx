## High-level description

The target file is a smoke test script for the Marimo application framework, specifically testing the integration and functionality of Pandas DataFrames within the Marimo environment. It creates several DataFrames with different configurations and displays them using Marimo's UI capabilities. The script also performs a simple aggregation operation on a DataFrame and displays the result.

## Code Structure

The script is structured using the Marimo framework, which organizes code into "cells" that are executed in sequence. Each cell is a function decorated with `@app.cell`, indicating that it is a part of the Marimo application. The script uses Pandas to create and manipulate DataFrames and Marimo's UI components to display these DataFrames.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object for the Marimo framework. It is configured with a medium width for the UI.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a cell in the Marimo application. Each cell represents a unit of work that can be executed independently.

### `__()`
#### Description
There are multiple functions named `__()` in the script, each serving a different purpose. These functions are defined as cells in the Marimo application and perform various operations related to DataFrames.

#### Inputs and Outputs
Each `__()` function has different inputs and outputs, depending on its purpose:

1. **First `__()` function:**
   - **Inputs:** None
   - **Outputs:** Returns a tuple containing a dictionary of data, three DataFrames, and the imported modules `mo` and `pd`.

2. **Second `__()` function:**
   - **Inputs:** `pd` (Pandas module)
   - **Outputs:** Returns a tuple containing an aggregated DataFrame.

3. **Third `__()` function:**
   - **Inputs:** `df`, `df_with_index`, `df_with_named_index` (DataFrames)
   - **Outputs:** None (returns `None`)

4. **Fourth `__()` function:**
   - **Inputs:** `agg_df`, `mo` (aggregated DataFrame and Marimo module)
   - **Outputs:** None (returns `None`)

5. **Fifth `__()` function:**
   - **Inputs:** `df`, `mo` (DataFrame and Marimo module)
   - **Outputs:** None (returns `None`)

6. **Sixth `__()` function:**
   - **Inputs:** `df_with_index`, `mo` (DataFrame with index and Marimo module)
   - **Outputs:** None (returns `None`)

7. **Seventh `__()` function:**
   - **Inputs:** `df_with_named_index`, `mo` (DataFrame with named index and Marimo module)
   - **Outputs:** None (returns `None`)

#### Internal Logic
- The first function creates several DataFrames with different configurations and returns them along with the imported modules.
- The second function creates a DataFrame, performs a group-by operation to calculate the mean, and returns the aggregated DataFrame.
- The third function accesses the indices of the provided DataFrames but does not perform any operations or return any values.
- The fourth to seventh functions use Marimo's UI capabilities to display the provided DataFrames.

## Side Effects
- The script modifies the UI state by displaying DataFrames using Marimo's UI components.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Provides the application framework and UI components. |
| `pandas` | Used for creating and manipulating DataFrames. |

## Error Handling
The script does not implement specific error handling mechanisms beyond the basic functionality provided by the Marimo framework and Pandas library.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose any API or public interface.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
