## High-level description

The target file is a Python script designed to run a simple smoke test using the Marimo framework. It creates a minimal application that displays a Pandas DataFrame in a UI table using Marimo's UI capabilities. The script is structured to be executed as a standalone application.

## Code Structure

The main components of the code are:
- The `marimo.App` instance, which serves as the application framework.
- A decorated function using `@app.cell`, which defines a cell in the Marimo application. This cell imports necessary libraries, creates a Pandas DataFrame, and displays it using Marimo's UI table functionality.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which is the main application object in the Marimo framework. It is used to define and run the application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell in the Marimo application. A cell is a unit of computation or UI component that can be executed within the Marimo app.

### `__()`
#### Description
This function is decorated with `@app.cell` and is responsible for creating and displaying a Pandas DataFrame in the Marimo UI.

#### Inputs
None directly, but it imports:
- `pandas` as `pd`
- `marimo` as `mo`

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| df | DataFrame | A Pandas DataFrame containing a single column with a float value. |
| mo | module | The Marimo module, used for UI operations. |
| pd | module | The Pandas module, used for data manipulation. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Import the Pandas library as `pd` and the Marimo library as `mo`.
2. Create a Pandas DataFrame `df` with a single column named "data" containing a float value `[2.0]`.
3. Use `mo.ui.table(df)` to display the DataFrame in a table format within the Marimo UI.
4. Return the DataFrame `df`, the Marimo module `mo`, and the Pandas module `pd`.

### `if __name__ == "__main__":`
#### Description
This conditional block checks if the script is being run as the main program and, if so, executes `app.run()` to start the Marimo application.

## References

- `marimo.App`: The main application class from the Marimo framework.
- `mo.ui.table`: A function from the Marimo UI module used to display data in a table format.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Provides the framework for building and running the application, as well as UI components. |
| `pandas` | Used for creating and manipulating the DataFrame that is displayed in the UI. |

## Error Handling

The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It relies on the underlying libraries (Marimo and Pandas) to handle any exceptions that may occur during execution.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
