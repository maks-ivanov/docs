## High-level description

The target file is a smoke test script for the Marimo framework, specifically designed to test the rendering of Plotly visualizations under different configurations and renderers. It uses the Marimo framework to define a series of cells that configure Plotly renderers, create a sample plot, and display it using various settings to ensure compatibility and functionality.

## Code Structure

The code is structured using the Marimo framework, which allows for the definition of "cells" that encapsulate specific pieces of functionality. Each cell is decorated with `@app.cell`, indicating that it is a part of the Marimo application. The cells are executed in sequence, and they interact with each other by passing and returning variables.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object for the Marimo framework. It is used to define and manage the execution of cells within the script.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. Each cell is a function that performs a specific task, such as configuring Plotly renderers or creating and displaying a plot.

### `__()`
#### Description
The `__()` functions are the individual cells defined within the Marimo application. Each cell performs a specific task related to configuring Plotly or rendering plots.

#### Inputs and Outputs
The inputs and outputs of each cell vary, but they generally involve Plotly and Marimo objects. For example, some cells take `pio` (Plotly I/O) as input and return configurations, while others take a Plotly figure (`fig`) and render it using Marimo's UI functions.

#### Internal Logic
- The first cell provides a markdown description of the notebook's purpose.
- The second cell imports necessary modules and sets default configurations for Plotly renderers.
- Subsequent cells retrieve and display renderer configurations, create a sample plot using Plotly Express, and render the plot using different configurations and renderers.

### `get_config`
#### Description
A helper function defined within a cell to retrieve the configuration of a given Plotly renderer. It handles exceptions by returning "none" if the configuration cannot be retrieved.

#### Inputs
| Name     | Type   | Description                        |
|:---------|:-------|:-----------------------------------|
| renderer | object | A Plotly renderer object to inspect |

#### Outputs
| Name       | Type   | Description                        |
|:-----------|:-------|:-----------------------------------|
| config_str | string | String representation of the renderer's configuration |

#### Internal Logic
The function attempts to convert the renderer's configuration to a string. If an exception occurs, it returns "none".

## Side Effects

- The script modifies the default configuration of Plotly renderers, which could affect other Plotly operations if run in the same environment.
- It uses Marimo's UI functions to render plots, which may have side effects related to UI rendering.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose                                      |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------------|
| marimo     | Framework used to define and manage cells    |
| plotly     | Library used for creating and rendering plots|

## Error Handling

The `get_config` function includes basic error handling to manage exceptions when accessing renderer configurations. It returns "none" if an error occurs.

## Logging

There is no explicit logging mechanism implemented in the code. The focus is on rendering and displaying plots.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
