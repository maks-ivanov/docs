## High-level description

The target file `key_with_period.py` is a smoke test script for the Marimo application framework. It demonstrates the handling of JSON data with keys containing periods and showcases the use of Marimo's UI components to display this data in various formats, such as tables and dataframes.

## Code Structure

The script is structured using the Marimo framework's `@app.cell` decorator, which defines individual cells or units of execution within the application. Each cell performs a specific task, such as importing libraries, creating data, or displaying data using Marimo's UI components.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object. It is used to define and run the application by organizing the execution of different cells.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. Each cell is a function that performs a specific task, such as importing modules, creating data, or interacting with the UI.

### `__()`
#### Description
Multiple functions are defined with the name `__`, each decorated with `@app.cell`. These functions perform various tasks within the application.

#### Inputs and Outputs
- The first `__()` function imports the `marimo` and `pandas` libraries and returns them.
- The second `__()` function creates a list of JSON objects with a key containing a period and returns this list.
- The third `__()` function takes the JSON list and the `marimo` module as inputs and displays the list in a table using Marimo's UI.
- The fourth `__()` function takes the JSON list, `marimo`, and `pandas` as inputs and uses Marimo's data explorer to display the data.
- The fifth `__()` function takes the JSON list, `marimo`, and `pandas` as inputs and displays the data as a dataframe using Marimo's UI.

### `if __name__ == "__main__":`
#### Description
This block checks if the script is being run as the main program and, if so, calls `app.run()` to execute the application.

## References

- **Marimo Framework**: The script heavily relies on the Marimo framework for defining and running the application, as well as for UI components like tables, data explorers, and dataframes.
- **Pandas Library**: Used for creating dataframes from the JSON list.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Provides the application framework and UI components. |
| `pandas`   | Used for data manipulation and creating dataframes. |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that all operations, such as data creation and UI rendering, will succeed without exceptions.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose any API or public interface. It is a standalone application script meant to be executed directly.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
