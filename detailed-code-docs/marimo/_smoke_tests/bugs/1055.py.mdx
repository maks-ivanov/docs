title: "1055.py"

## High-level description
The target file is a script designed to perform smoke tests for a specific bug (identified as 1055) within the Marimo framework. It defines a simple application using the Marimo library, which includes two cells: one that imports the `manim_slides` module and another that prints the number `1`. The script is executed by running the application.

## Code Structure
The script is structured around the Marimo framework, utilizing its `App` class to define and run a simple application. The application consists of two cells, each defined by a function decorated with `@app.cell`. These cells are executed when the application runs.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class. It serves as the main application object that manages the execution of the defined cells.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. Each decorated function represents a cell that can perform specific actions when the application is run.

### `__()`
#### Description
There are two functions named `__`, each decorated with `@app.cell`. These functions define the behavior of the cells within the application.

#### Inputs
- None

#### Outputs
- The first `__` function returns the `manim_slides` module.
- The second `__` function returns `None` after printing the number `1`.

#### Internal Logic
- The first `__` function imports the `manim_slides` module and returns it as a tuple.
- The second `__` function simply prints the number `1` to the console.

## Side Effects
- The second `__` function has the side effect of printing to the console.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Used to create and manage the application. |
| `manim_slides` | Imported within the first cell, presumably for use in the application. |

## Execution
The script is executed by calling `app.run()` within the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, which runs the application and executes the defined cells.

## Error Handling
The script does not include any explicit error handling mechanisms. Any errors during the import of `manim_slides` or execution of the cells would result in exceptions being raised.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms. The only output is the print statement in the second cell.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
