## High-level description

The target file is a simple script using the `marimo` framework to create a series of interactive cells. It prompts the user for their name via standard input and then displays a greeting message using markdown formatting. The script also includes some basic print statements and is designed to be run as a standalone application.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the `marimo` framework, which allows for the creation of interactive applications using "cells." Each cell is a function decorated with `@app.cell`, and these cells are executed in sequence when the application runs. The cells in this script perform tasks such as importing modules, capturing user input, and displaying output.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which is used to manage the execution of the interactive cells defined in the script.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a "cell" within the `marimo` application. Each cell can perform a specific task and can return values that are passed to subsequent cells.

### `__()`
#### Description
This is a placeholder function name used for each cell. In the context of `marimo`, the function name is not significant, as the decorator handles the execution order and dependencies.

#### Inputs
- The first cell imports the `marimo` module and returns it.
- The second cell captures user input for their name.
- The third cell takes the `marimo` module and the user's name as inputs to display a greeting.
- The fourth and fifth cells do not take any inputs and simply print messages.

#### Outputs
- The first cell returns the `marimo` module.
- The second cell returns the user's input (name).
- The third cell does not return any output.
- The fourth and fifth cells do not return any output.

#### Internal Logic
- The first cell imports the `marimo` module and returns it for use in subsequent cells.
- The second cell uses the `input()` function to prompt the user for their name and returns the input.
- The third cell uses the `marimo.md()` function to display a markdown-formatted greeting message.
- The fourth and fifth cells use `print()` to output simple text messages.

## Side Effects

- The second cell reads from standard input, which requires user interaction.
- The third cell outputs a markdown-formatted message, which is a side effect of using the `marimo.md()` function.
- The fourth and fifth cells print messages to the console.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Used to create and manage interactive application cells. |

## Error Handling

The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It relies on the standard behavior of Python's `input()` and `print()` functions, as well as the `marimo` framework's handling of cell execution.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is designed to be run as a standalone application.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
