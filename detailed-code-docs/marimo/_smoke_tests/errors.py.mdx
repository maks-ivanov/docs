## High-level description

The target file `marimo/_smoke_tests/errors.py` is a script designed to test the functionality of the `marimo` framework, specifically focusing on error handling and edge cases. It defines several cells using the `@app.cell` decorator, each performing simple operations or intentionally containing errors to test the framework's robustness. The script concludes by running the application, which likely executes these cells to observe their behavior.

## Code Structure

The main structure of the code revolves around the `marimo.App` instance, `app`, and the use of the `@app.cell` decorator to define various functions (referred to as "cells"). These cells are executed as part of the application's workflow. The code also includes a call to `app._unparsable_cell`, which seems to be a mechanism to test how the application handles unparsable or erroneous code.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object. It is used to define and manage the execution of cells within the application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define functions (or "cells") that are part of the application's workflow. Each cell performs a specific operation, and the decorator likely registers these functions with the `app` instance for execution.

### `app._unparsable_cell`
#### Description
This function is used to introduce a cell with unparsable code into the application. It is likely intended to test how the application handles syntax errors or incomplete code.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| code | str | A string containing the unparsable code. |
| name | str | The name of the cell. |

### `app.run`
#### Description
The `app.run` method is called to execute the application, which likely involves running all the defined cells and handling any errors or outputs they produce.

## Side Effects

- The code modifies the state of the `app` instance by adding cells and potentially executing them.
- The `app._unparsable_cell` function introduces a syntax error into the application, which may trigger error handling mechanisms.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Provides the `App` class and related functionality for defining and running application cells. |

## Error Handling

The code includes a specific mechanism for testing error handling through the `app._unparsable_cell` function, which introduces a syntax error. This suggests that the application has some form of error handling to manage such cases, although the specifics are not detailed in the code.

## Logging

There is no explicit logging mechanism implemented in the code. However, the execution of cells and handling of errors may involve some form of logging within the `marimo` framework, which is not visible in this snippet.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
