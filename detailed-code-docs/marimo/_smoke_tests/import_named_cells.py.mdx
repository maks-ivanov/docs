## High-level description

The target file `import_named_cells.py` is a smoke test script for the Marimo framework, which is used to create interactive UI elements in a notebook-like environment. This script demonstrates the import and usage of named cells from another module, `named_cells.py`, to create and display UI components such as sliders and text inputs. It uses the `marimo.App` class to define and run these interactive cells.

## Code Structure

The script is structured around the `marimo.App` class, which is used to define cells that encapsulate specific functionalities. Each cell is decorated with `@app.cell`, indicating that it is a part of the Marimo application. The script imports functions from the `named_cells` module and uses them to create and manipulate UI elements.

## References

- `marimo.App`: The main class used to create and manage the application.
- `named_cells`: A module that provides functions for creating UI elements like sliders and other display elements.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
An instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to define and manage the interactive cells in the script.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
A decorator used to define a cell within the Marimo application. Each decorated function represents a cell that can execute a specific task or display a UI component.

### `__()`
#### Description
Multiple anonymous functions (all named `__`) are defined as cells. Each function performs a specific task, such as importing modules, displaying markdown text, or interacting with UI elements.

#### Inputs
- Varies per function; some take no inputs, while others take UI elements or modules as inputs.

#### Outputs
- Varies per function; some return UI elements, while others return nothing.

#### Internal Logic
- The first cell imports the `marimo` module.
- The second cell imports `display_slider` and `display_element` from `named_cells`.
- Subsequent cells use these imports to create and display UI elements, such as sliders and text inputs, and to render markdown text.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Provides the framework for creating interactive UI elements and managing the application. |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the imported modules and functions will execute without issues.

## Logging

The script uses markdown rendering via `mo.md` to display messages, which can be considered a form of logging for user interaction.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API but uses the Marimo framework's interface to define and run interactive cells.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
