## High-level description

The target file `named_cells.py` is part of the Marimo framework's smoke tests, which are used to verify the basic functionality of the framework. This script defines a series of cells using the Marimo application framework to create and display UI elements such as sliders and checkboxes. The script is structured to demonstrate the creation and interaction with these UI components within the Marimo environment.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the Marimo application framework, which uses the concept of "cells" to encapsulate functionality. Each cell is a function decorated with `@app.cell`, indicating that it is a part of the Marimo application. The cells are used to import the Marimo library, create UI elements, and display them using Markdown.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object for the Marimo framework. It is used to define and manage the lifecycle of the application and its cells.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a "cell" within the Marimo application. Each cell encapsulates a piece of functionality, such as creating a UI element or displaying content.

### `__()`
#### Description
This cell imports the Marimo library as `mo` and returns it. It serves as a setup cell to make the Marimo library available for other cells.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The Marimo library module. |

### `display_slider(mo)`
#### Description
This cell creates a slider UI element with a range from 1 to 10 using the Marimo UI library. It then displays the slider using Markdown.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The Marimo library module. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| slider | UI element | A slider UI element. |

#### Internal Logic
- A slider is created using `mo.ui.slider(1, 10)`.
- The slider is displayed using `mo.md()`.

### `__(mo)`
#### Description
This cell creates a checkbox UI element initialized to `False` and returns it.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The Marimo library module. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| element | UI element | A checkbox UI element. |

### `display_element(element, mo)`
#### Description
This cell displays a given UI element using Markdown.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| element | UI element | A UI element to display. |
| mo | module | The Marimo library module. |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- The element is displayed using `mo.md()`.

## References

- The `marimo` library is imported and used extensively throughout the script to create and manage UI elements.
- The related file `import_named_cells.py` references functions from `named_cells.py`, indicating that these functions are intended to be reusable components within the Marimo framework.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Provides the framework for creating and managing UI elements and applications. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the Marimo framework will manage any exceptions or errors that occur during the execution of the cells.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms. It relies on the Marimo framework's capabilities to display information using Markdown.

## API/Interface Reference

The code does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a script within the Marimo framework to demonstrate the creation and display of UI elements.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
