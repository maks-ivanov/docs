## High-level description

The code in the target file is a set of smoke tests for form components using the Marimo framework. It demonstrates the creation and validation of basic forms, including text areas, sliders, and dictionaries, with various UI options like clear buttons and borders. The code also includes validation logic for form inputs and displays the form values using Marimo's UI components.

## Code Structure

The code is structured using Marimo's `@app.cell` decorator, which defines individual cells or components of the application. Each cell is responsible for a specific part of the UI or logic, such as creating a form, validating inputs, or displaying form values. The cells are interconnected, with some cells passing their outputs as inputs to others.

## Symbols

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell in the Marimo application. Each cell represents a distinct part of the application, such as a UI component or a piece of logic. The decorator allows the Marimo framework to manage the execution and rendering of these components.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Various | Depends on the cell | Inputs vary per cell and are typically outputs from other cells or modules like `mo` and `random`. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Various | Depends on the cell | Outputs vary per cell and are typically UI components or values to be used by other cells. |

#### Internal Logic
Each cell contains logic specific to its purpose, such as creating UI components, setting properties, or defining validation functions. The cells use Marimo's UI components and methods to build and manage the application interface.

### `mo.ui.text_area`
#### Description
Creates a text area UI component with options for full width, placeholder text, and form properties like submit button label and tooltip.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| label | str | The label for the text area. |
| full_width | bool | Whether the text area should span the full width. |
| placeholder | str | Placeholder text for the text area. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| form | UI Component | A form component with the specified properties. |

### `mo.ui.slider`
#### Description
Creates a slider UI component with a specified range and default value.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| min | int | Minimum value of the slider. |
| max | int | Maximum value of the slider. |
| value | int | Default value of the slider. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| slider | UI Component | A slider component with the specified properties. |

### `mo.ui.text`
#### Description
Creates a text input UI component.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| text | UI Component | A text input component. |

### `mo.ui.dictionary`
#### Description
Creates a dictionary UI component that can contain various other UI components like sliders, text inputs, and arrays.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| components | dict | A dictionary of UI components to include. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dictionary | UI Component | A dictionary component containing the specified UI elements. |

## Side Effects

- The code modifies the UI state by creating and updating form components.
- Random numbers are generated to monitor re-renders, which can affect the UI display.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Provides the framework and UI components for building the application. |
| random | Used to generate random numbers for monitoring re-renders. |

## Error Handling

The code includes a validation function for form inputs, which checks for missing first and last names and ensures a minimum number of years of experience. If validation fails, an error message is returned.

## Logging

No explicit logging mechanisms are implemented in the code.

## TODOs

No TODOs or notes are present in the code.
