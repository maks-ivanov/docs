## High-level description

The target file is a script for a Marimo application that performs data visualization and analysis on a dataset of one million flight records. It uses the Altair library to create interactive charts, allowing users to explore flight data, such as delays and distances, and visualize connections between airports on a map. The script is structured using Marimo's cell-based architecture, which facilitates the creation of interactive dashboards.

## Code Structure

The script is organized into several `@app.cell` functions, each responsible for a specific part of the data processing or visualization. These cells are executed in sequence to build the interactive dashboard. The main components include loading data, creating UI elements like dropdowns, generating charts, and displaying data summaries.

## Symbols

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell in the Marimo application. Each cell represents a unit of computation or UI element that contributes to the overall functionality of the app.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Various | Various | Each cell can have different inputs depending on its purpose, such as data frames, UI components, or visualization libraries. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Various | Various | Outputs vary by cell, including data frames, UI components, or visualization objects. |

#### Internal Logic
Each cell performs a specific task, such as loading data, creating a chart, or updating the UI. The logic within a cell is typically straightforward, involving data manipulation or visualization using libraries like Pandas and Altair.

### `marimo.App`
#### Description
The `marimo.App` class is used to create a Marimo application instance. It manages the execution of cells and the rendering of the UI.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| width | str | Specifies the width of the application UI. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| app | App | An instance of the Marimo application. |

## Error Handling

The script uses the `mo.stop` function to halt execution if certain conditions are not met, such as when a dataset is empty. This ensures that the application does not proceed with invalid or incomplete data.

## Logging

The script does not explicitly implement logging, but it uses markdown and UI elements to provide feedback and information to the user within the application interface.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an external API but provides an interactive interface through the Marimo application framework. Users interact with the application via UI components like dropdowns, charts, and tables.

## TODOs

There are no explicit TODOs or notes left in the code.
