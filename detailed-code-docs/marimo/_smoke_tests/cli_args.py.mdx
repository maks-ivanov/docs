## High-level description

The target file `marimo/_smoke_tests/cli_args.py` is a script designed to test the command-line interface (CLI) argument handling capabilities of the Marimo framework. It defines a simple application using Marimo's `App` class and includes cells that demonstrate how to retrieve and display CLI arguments passed to the script.

## Code Structure

The script is structured around the `marimo.App` class, which is used to create an application instance. The application is composed of several cells, each defined using the `@app.cell` decorator. These cells perform specific tasks, such as importing modules, displaying markdown instructions, and converting CLI arguments to a dictionary format.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object. It is used to define and manage the execution of cells within the script.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. Each cell is a function that performs a specific task when executed. In this script, there are three cells defined:

1. **First Cell**: Imports the Marimo module and returns it.
2. **Second Cell**: Displays a markdown message with instructions on how to re-run the script with specific CLI arguments.
3. **Third Cell**: Retrieves the CLI arguments using `mo.cli_args()` and converts them to a dictionary format.

#### Inputs
- The first cell takes no inputs.
- The second and third cells take `mo` (the Marimo module) as an input.

#### Outputs
- The first cell outputs the Marimo module.
- The second cell has no output.
- The third cell outputs a dictionary representation of the CLI arguments.

### `app.run()`
#### Description
The `app.run()` method is called at the end of the script to execute the application. It triggers the execution of all defined cells in the order they are declared.

## References

- **`marimo.App`**: The main application class used to create and manage the Marimo application.
- **`mo.cli_args()`**: A function from the Marimo module that retrieves the command-line arguments passed to the script.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Provides the framework for creating and managing the application and its cells. |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors. It relies on the Marimo framework to manage any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the cells.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms. Any logging would be handled by the Marimo framework if necessary.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone script to test CLI argument handling.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
