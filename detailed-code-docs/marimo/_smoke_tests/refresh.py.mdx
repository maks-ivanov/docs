## High-level description

The code in `marimo/_smoke_tests/refresh.py` is a smoke test script for the Marimo framework, which is used to create interactive applications. This script sets up a simple application that includes a random number guessing game with a refresh interval selection. The application uses Marimo's UI components to create buttons, accordions, and refresh intervals, and it provides feedback based on user interactions.

## Code Structure

The script is structured using Marimo's `@app.cell` decorator, which defines individual cells or components of the application. Each cell is responsible for a specific part of the application's functionality, such as importing modules, creating UI elements, or handling logic for the guessing game. The cells are interconnected, with some cells depending on the outputs of others.

## Symbols

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell in the Marimo application. Each cell represents a distinct part of the application logic or UI component. The decorator allows the function to be registered as a part of the Marimo app.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The Marimo module, used for accessing UI components and other functionalities. |
| random | module | The Python random module, used for generating random numbers. |
| reset_button | UI component | A button UI component created in a previous cell. |
| my_pick | int | A randomly generated number representing the correct guess. |
| refresh | UI component | A refresh interval selector UI component. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| reset_button | UI component | The button UI component for resetting the game. |
| my_pick | int | The randomly generated number for the guessing game. |
| refresh | UI component | The refresh interval selector UI component. |
| guess | int | The user's guess, randomly generated. |

#### Internal Logic
- The first cell imports necessary modules (`marimo` and `random`).
- The second cell creates a reset button using Marimo's UI components.
- The third cell generates a random number (`my_pick`) and displays it in an accordion UI component.
- The fourth cell creates a refresh interval selector with options like "1s", "10s", "1m", and "100ms".
- The fifth cell generates a random guess and compares it to `my_pick`, providing feedback through Marimo's markdown and callout features.

## Side Effects
- The script modifies the UI state by creating and updating UI components such as buttons, accordions, and refresh selectors.
- It provides feedback to the user through UI elements based on the correctness of the guess.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Used for creating and managing UI components and application logic. |
| random | Used for generating random numbers for the guessing game. |

## Error Handling
The script does not explicitly handle errors beyond the basic functionality provided by the Marimo framework. It assumes that the UI components and random number generation will function as expected.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms. Feedback is provided directly to the user through UI components.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is a standalone application intended to be run as a smoke test for the Marimo framework.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code. The script appears to be complete and functional for its intended purpose.
