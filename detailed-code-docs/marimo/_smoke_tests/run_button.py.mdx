title: "run_button.py"
---

## High-level description
The target file `run_button.py` is part of the Marimo framework's smoke tests, which are designed to verify the basic functionality of UI components. This script specifically tests the integration and behavior of a run button and a slider within a Marimo application. It sets up a simple application with UI elements and defines interactions between them, such as stopping the application based on the button's state and using the slider's value.

## Code Structure
The code is structured around the Marimo framework's `App` class and its `@app.cell` decorator, which is used to define reactive cells. Each cell represents a unit of computation or UI interaction, and they are executed in the context of the Marimo application. The cells are interconnected, with some cells depending on the outputs of others, such as the button and slider values.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object for the Marimo framework. It is used to define and run the application, managing the lifecycle and execution of the reactive cells.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define reactive cells within the Marimo application. Each decorated function represents a cell that can perform computations, interact with UI components, or manage application state.

### `__(mo)`
#### Description
This cell creates a run button UI component using the Marimo framework's UI module.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | Module | The Marimo module, providing access to UI components and application functions. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| b | UI Component | A run button UI component. |

### `__(mo)`
#### Description
This cell creates a slider UI component with a range from 1 to 10.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | Module | The Marimo module, providing access to UI components and application functions. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| s | UI Component | A slider UI component. |

### `__(b, mo, s)`
#### Description
This cell manages the interaction between the run button and the slider. It stops the application if the button is not pressed and displays a message prompting the user to click the run button to submit the slider's value.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| b | UI Component | The run button UI component. |
| mo | Module | The Marimo module, providing access to UI components and application functions. |
| s | UI Component | The slider UI component. |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Checks the value of the run button.
- If the button is not pressed, it stops the application and displays a message.
- Accesses the slider's value.

### `__(b, mo)`
#### Description
This cell generates a random integer between 0 and 1000 when the run button is pressed.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| b | UI Component | The run button UI component. |
| mo | Module | The Marimo module, providing access to UI components and application functions. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| random | Module | The random module, used to generate random numbers. |

#### Internal Logic
- Checks the value of the run button.
- If the button is pressed, generates a random integer.

### `__()`
#### Description
This cell imports the Marimo module and returns it.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | Module | The Marimo module. |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Provides the framework for building and running the application, including UI components and reactive cells. |
| random | Used to generate random integers within the application logic. |

## Error Handling
The code does not explicitly handle errors beyond basic checks, such as verifying the button's state before proceeding with certain actions.

## Logging
The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The code does not expose an API or public interface beyond the UI components created within the Marimo application.
