## High-level description

The target file `marimo/_smoke_tests/pdf.py` is a script designed to test the functionality of the Marimo application framework, specifically focusing on rendering and interacting with PDF documents. It sets up a simple application using Marimo's cell-based architecture to display a PDF from a URL, allowing the user to specify the starting page number.

## Code Structure

The script is structured using Marimo's `@app.cell` decorator, which defines individual cells that can be executed within the Marimo application. Each cell performs a specific task, such as importing modules, setting up UI elements, or rendering a PDF. The cells are executed in sequence to build the application.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which represents the application being built. It is configured with a full-width layout.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. Each decorated function represents a cell that can perform a specific task, such as importing modules, creating UI elements, or rendering content.

### `__()`
#### Description
This is a series of unnamed functions (using the placeholder name `__`) that are decorated with `@app.cell`. Each function represents a cell in the Marimo application, performing tasks such as importing modules, setting up UI elements, and rendering PDFs.

#### Inputs and Outputs
The inputs and outputs vary for each cell, depending on the specific task it performs. For example, some cells take no inputs and return module references, while others take UI elements or page numbers as inputs and return rendered content.

#### Internal Logic
- The first cell imports necessary modules (`marimo`, `requests`, `io`) and returns them for use in subsequent cells.
- The second cell uses `mo.md` to display a markdown header for the PDF section.
- The third cell creates a UI element for selecting the starting page number of the PDF.
- The fourth cell renders a PDF from a URL, using the selected starting page number.
- The fifth cell downloads the PDF content using `requests`, creates a `BytesIO` object, and renders the PDF using Marimo's PDF rendering capabilities.
- The sixth cell simply returns the rendered PDF object.

## Side Effects

- The script makes an HTTP request to download a PDF file from a specified URL.
- It creates UI elements and renders content within the Marimo application framework.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Used for building the application and rendering UI elements. |
| `requests` | Used for making HTTP requests to download the PDF file. |
| `io` | Used for creating a `BytesIO` object to handle PDF content in memory. |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors. Any issues with downloading the PDF or rendering it would likely result in runtime exceptions.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application using the Marimo framework.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
