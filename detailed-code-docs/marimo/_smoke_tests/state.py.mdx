## High-level description

The target file `marimo/_smoke_tests/state.py` is a script designed to test the state management and UI components of the Marimo framework. It demonstrates the use of stateful UI elements, such as buttons and number inputs, and how they can be interconnected. The script uses the Marimo framework to create a simple application that manipulates and displays state through UI components.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the Marimo framework's `App` and `cell` decorators, which are used to define reactive components. Each `@app.cell` function represents a reactive cell that can depend on other cells and update automatically when its dependencies change. The script uses these cells to manage state and UI components, such as buttons and number inputs, and to demonstrate state synchronization between different UI elements.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object. It is used to define reactive cells and manage the application's lifecycle.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a reactive cell within the Marimo application. Each cell can have dependencies on other cells and will automatically update when its dependencies change.

### `__()`
#### Description
Multiple functions named `__()` are defined using the `@app.cell` decorator. Each function represents a reactive cell in the application. These cells import necessary modules, manage state, and define UI components.

#### Inputs and Outputs
The inputs and outputs of each `__()` function vary depending on its purpose. Some cells import modules, while others manage state or define UI components.

#### Internal Logic
- **Module Import Cells**: These cells import modules like `marimo`, `math`, `random`, and `time` and return them for use in other cells.
- **State Management Cells**: These cells use the `mo.state()` function to create and manage state variables. They define `get_state` and `set_state` functions to access and modify the state.
- **UI Component Cells**: These cells define UI components like buttons and number inputs using the `mo.ui` module. They demonstrate how to bind state changes to UI events, such as button clicks or input changes.

### `get_state`, `set_state`
#### Description
These are functions returned by the `mo.state()` function, used to get and set the state of a variable within the application.

### `get_angle`, `set_angle`
#### Description
Similar to `get_state` and `set_state`, these functions manage the state of an angle value, allowing it to be synchronized between different UI components.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Provides the framework for creating the application, managing state, and defining UI components. |
| `math`     | Used for mathematical operations, particularly for converting between degrees and radians. |
| `random`   | Imported but not used in the current script. |
| `time`     | Imported but not used in the current script. |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors. It relies on the Marimo framework to manage any exceptions that may occur during the execution of reactive cells.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is a standalone application script designed to demonstrate the use of the Marimo framework for state management and UI components.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
