## High-level description

The target file `marimo/_smoke_tests/code_editor.py` is a script designed to test the functionality of a code editor UI component within the Marimo application framework. It demonstrates the use of the `code_editor` UI element with different programming languages and themes, and provides a user interface for selecting these options dynamically.

## Code Structure

The script is structured using the Marimo framework, which allows for the creation of interactive UI components. The main components of the script are defined using the `@app.cell` decorator, which indicates that each function is a cell in the Marimo application. These cells are used to create and configure UI elements such as code editors, dropdowns, and radio buttons.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object for the Marimo framework. It is used to define and run the application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a cell in the Marimo application. Each cell represents a distinct part of the UI or logic that can be executed independently.

### `__(mo)`
#### Description
This function creates a code editor UI component with a simple Python code snippet.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | object | The Marimo object used to access UI components. |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Calls `mo.ui.code_editor` with a Python code snippet and a minimum height of 50.

### `__(mo)`
#### Description
This function creates a code editor UI component with an SQL code snippet and a light theme.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | object | The Marimo object used to access UI components. |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Calls `mo.ui.code_editor` with an SQL code snippet, specifying the language as "sql" and the theme as "light".

### `__(languages, mo)`
#### Description
This function creates a dropdown for language selection and a radio button for theme selection.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| languages | list | A list of programming languages. |
| mo | object | The Marimo object used to access UI components. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| language_select | object | The dropdown UI component for language selection. |
| theme_select | object | The radio button UI component for theme selection. |

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a dropdown for selecting a programming language.
- Creates a radio button for selecting a theme (light or dark).
- Arranges these components horizontally using `mo.hstack`.

### `__(language_select, mo, samples, theme_select)`
#### Description
This function creates a code editor UI component based on the selected language and theme.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| language_select | object | The dropdown UI component for language selection. |
| mo | object | The Marimo object used to access UI components. |
| samples | dict | A dictionary mapping languages to code samples. |
| theme_select | object | The radio button UI component for theme selection. |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Retrieves the selected language and theme.
- Calls `mo.ui.code_editor` with the corresponding code sample, language, and theme.

### `__()`
#### Description
This function initializes the list of languages and their corresponding code samples.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| languages | list | A list of programming languages. |
| samples | dict | A dictionary mapping languages to code samples. |

#### Internal Logic
- Defines a list of programming languages.
- Defines a dictionary of code samples for each language.

### `__()`
#### Description
This function imports the Marimo module and returns it.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The Marimo module. |

#### Internal Logic
- Imports the Marimo module as `mo`.
- Returns the module.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Provides the framework and UI components for building the application. |

## Error Handling

The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It relies on the Marimo framework to manage any errors that occur during the execution of the UI components.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application using the Marimo framework.

## TODOs
