## High-level description

The target file `marimo/_smoke_tests/dataframe.py` is a script designed to test and demonstrate the functionality of the `marimo` library, particularly its UI components for handling and displaying data structures like lists, dictionaries, and dataframes. It showcases how to use `marimo` to create interactive UI elements such as tables and data explorers for different data formats, including Pandas, Polars, and Arrow dataframes.

## Code Structure

The script is structured around the `marimo.App` framework, which allows for the creation of interactive applications. The main components of the script are defined using the `@app.cell` decorator, which indicates that each function is a cell in the `marimo` application. These cells are used to display markdown content, create UI elements, and manipulate data. The script is organized into sections that demonstrate different data handling capabilities, such as displaying lists, dictionaries, and dataframes using `marimo`'s UI components.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which serves as the main application object for the script. It is used to define and run the interactive application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a cell in the `marimo` application. Each cell can contain code to display UI elements, process data, or render markdown content.

### `mo.ui.table`
#### Description
This function is used to create a table UI element in the `marimo` application. It can display data in various formats, such as lists, dictionaries, and dataframes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data | list/dict/DataFrame | The data to be displayed in the table. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| table | UI element | A table UI element displaying the input data. |

### `mo.ui.dataframe`
#### Description
This function is used to create a dataframe UI element in the `marimo` application, specifically for displaying Pandas or Polars dataframes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dataframe | DataFrame | The dataframe to be displayed. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dataframe_ui | UI element | A dataframe UI element displaying the input dataframe. |

### `mo.ui.data_explorer`
#### Description
This function is used to create a data explorer UI element, which provides an interactive interface for exploring dataframes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dataframe | DataFrame | The dataframe to be explored. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| explorer | UI element | A data explorer UI element for the input dataframe. |

## References

- The script references the `marimo` library extensively for creating UI components.
- It also uses external libraries like `pandas`, `polars`, `pyarrow`, `dask`, and `ibis` to handle different data formats.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Provides the framework and UI components for building interactive applications. |
| `pandas` | Used for handling and displaying Pandas dataframes. |
| `polars` | Used for handling and displaying Polars dataframes. |
| `pyarrow` | Used for handling and displaying Arrow tables. |
| `dask` | Used for handling large datasets with Dask dataframes. |
| `ibis` | Used for interactive data analysis with Ibis. |
| `vega_datasets` | Provides sample datasets for demonstration purposes. |
| `altair` | Used for creating interactive visualizations. |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors beyond basic exception raising. It assumes that the data and operations will succeed without issues.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms. It focuses on demonstrating UI components and data handling capabilities.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API. It is designed to be run as a standalone interactive application using the `marimo` framework.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code. The script appears to be complete and functional for its intended purpose.
