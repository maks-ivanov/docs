## High-level description

The `markdown_size.py` file is a smoke test script for the Marimo framework, which is used to create interactive applications. This script demonstrates the use of Marimo's capabilities to render markdown content, manipulate UI elements like sliders, and display data from the `vega_datasets` library. It showcases various markdown features such as tables, code blocks, math expressions, images, lists, blockquotes, links, and inline code.

## Code Structure

The script is structured using the Marimo framework, which organizes code into "cells" that are executed in sequence. Each cell is decorated with `@app.cell`, indicating that it is a part of the Marimo application. The script uses these cells to load data, create UI elements, and render markdown content.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
The `app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object for the Marimo framework. It is initialized with a width parameter set to "medium".

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell in the Marimo application. Each cell can contain a function that performs a specific task, such as loading data, creating UI elements, or rendering content.

### `__()`
#### Description
Multiple functions are defined with the name `__`, each decorated with `@app.cell`. These functions perform various tasks within the Marimo application.

#### Inputs and Outputs
- The first `__` function loads the `cars` dataset from the `vega_datasets` library and returns it along with the `data` module.
- The second `__` function creates a slider UI element with four steps and returns the selected size and a list of size labels.
- The third `__` function takes the slider value and size labels to render markdown text indicating the selected size.
- The fourth `__` function renders a comprehensive markdown document showcasing various markdown features.
- The fifth `__` function returns a dictionary with sample data types.
- The sixth `__` function imports the `marimo` module and returns it.

### `mo`
#### Description
The `mo` object is an instance of the Marimo framework, used within the cells to interact with the UI and render content.

## References

- The script references the `vega_datasets` library to load the `cars` dataset.
- The `marimo` library is used extensively to create the application and UI elements.

## Dependencies

| `vega_datasets`| Provides the `cars` dataset for demonstration.|

## Error Handling

The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the data loading and UI operations will succeed without errors.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose any API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application using the Marimo framework.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
