## High-level description

The target file `iplot.py` is a smoke test script for the Marimo framework, designed to test the interactive plotting capabilities using the `matplotlib` library. It defines a series of cells that create and manipulate plots, demonstrating the integration of Marimo's interactive features with `matplotlib` for both 2D and 3D plots.

## Code Structure

The code is structured using the Marimo framework's `App` and `cell` decorators, which allow for modular execution of code blocks. The main symbols in the code are the `interactive_plot` function and the various cells that execute plotting commands. The `interactive_plot` function is used to generate a 3D scatter plot, while other cells demonstrate simple 2D plotting.

## Symbols

### `interactive_plot`
#### Description
The `interactive_plot` function generates a 3D scatter plot using random data and integrates it with Marimo's interactive plotting capabilities.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| seed | int | Seed for the random number generator to ensure reproducibility. |
| size | int | Number of random data points to generate for the plot. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | object | An interactive plot object created by Marimo's `mpl.interactive` method. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the random seed for reproducibility.
2. Generates random integer data for x, y, and z coordinates.
3. Creates a 3D scatter plot using `matplotlib`.
4. Labels the axes.
5. Converts the plot into an interactive plot using Marimo's `mpl.interactive`.

### `app`
#### Description
An instance of the `marimo.App` class, which manages the execution of the decorated cells.

## Side Effects

- The `interactive_plot` function modifies the state of the `matplotlib` figure by adding a 3D scatter plot.
- The script, when run, will execute the plotting commands and display the plots interactively.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Provides the framework for creating and managing interactive applications. |
| `numpy` | Used for generating random data for plotting. |
| `matplotlib.pyplot` | Used for creating and displaying plots. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the necessary libraries are available and that the plotting commands will execute without issues.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API but uses the Marimo framework's cell-based execution model to run code blocks interactively.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
