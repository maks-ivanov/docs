## High-level description

The target file `marimo/_smoke_tests/routes.py` is a script that sets up a simple web application using the Marimo framework. It defines several routes for the application, each associated with a specific rendering function that generates content for the page. The application includes a sidebar with navigation links and pages for "Home", "About", and "Sales", with the "Sales" page featuring an interactive slider and a chart.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the Marimo framework's concept of "cells", which are functions decorated with `@app.cell`. Each cell can import modules, define UI components, or set up routes. The main symbols in the code are the `app` object, which is an instance of `marimo.App`, and the various functions decorated with `@app.cell`, which define the behavior and content of the application.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object. It is used to define cells and run the application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a "cell" in the Marimo application. Each cell can perform specific tasks such as importing modules, defining UI components, or setting up routes.

### `__()`
#### Description
This is a placeholder function name used multiple times with the `@app.cell` decorator. Each instance of this function serves a different purpose, such as importing modules, defining UI components, or setting up routes.

#### Internal Logic
- The first instance imports the Marimo module.
- The second instance sets up the sidebar with navigation links.
- The third instance defines the content for the "Home" page.
- The fourth instance defines the content for the "About" page.
- The fifth instance creates a slider UI component.
- The sixth instance defines the content for the "Sales" page, including a chart.
- The seventh instance sets up the routes for the application.

### `render_home`, `render_about`, `render_sales`
#### Description
These are functions defined within cells to render the content for the "Home", "About", and "Sales" pages, respectively. They return Markdown content or HTML generated using Marimo's markdown rendering capabilities.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| render_home | function | Renders the "Home" page content. |
| render_about | function | Renders the "About" page content. |
| render_sales | function | Renders the "Sales" page content, including a chart. |

#### Internal Logic
- `render_home` returns a Markdown string with the Marimo logo and links to documentation and community resources.
- `render_about` returns a Markdown string describing the Marimo project and its features.
- `render_sales` uses Altair to create a bar chart based on a slider's value and returns it as HTML.

## References

- The `marimo` module is heavily used throughout the script for creating the application, UI components, and rendering content.
- The `altair` library is used in the `render_sales` function to generate a chart.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Used to create the application and UI components. |
| altair | Used to generate interactive charts. |
| pandas | Used for data manipulation in the chart generation. |
| numpy | Used for numerical operations in the chart generation. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that all operations, such as rendering Markdown or generating charts, will succeed without exceptions.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API but defines a web application interface with the following routes:

| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| `#/home` | GET | None | HTML/Markdown | Renders the "Home" page. |
| `#/about` | GET | None | HTML/Markdown | Renders the "About" page. |
| `#/sales` | GET | None | HTML/Markdown | Renders the "Sales" page with a chart. |

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
