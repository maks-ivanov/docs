## High-level description

The target file `marimo/_smoke_tests/plain.py` is a script designed to test the functionality of the `marimo` library, specifically focusing on its layout and data visualization capabilities. It uses the `marimo` framework to create a simple application that loads a dataset, processes it using the `polars` library, and then displays it using various layout functions provided by `marimo`.

## Code Structure

The script is structured around the `marimo.App` class, which is used to define an application with a specified width. The application is composed of several cells, each defined by the `@app.cell` decorator. These cells perform specific tasks such as importing libraries, loading data, transforming data, and displaying data using different layout functions.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which is used to create and manage the application. It is initialized with a width parameter set to "medium".

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the `marimo` application. Each cell represents a unit of work that can import libraries, process data, or render outputs.

### `__()`
#### Description
The `__()` function is a placeholder name for multiple cells in the application. Each instance of this function performs a specific task, such as importing libraries, loading data, or rendering data.

#### Inputs and Outputs
- The first `__()` function imports necessary libraries and returns them.
- The second `__()` function takes `data` and `pl` as inputs, converts a dataset to a `polars` DataFrame, and returns it.
- The third `__()` function takes `df` and `mo` as inputs and displays the DataFrame as a table using `marimo.ui.table`.
- The fourth `__()` function takes `df` and `mo` as inputs and displays the DataFrame using `marimo.plain`.
- The fifth and sixth `__()` functions demonstrate layout capabilities using `marimo.hstack` and `marimo.vstack`.

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that all operations, such as data loading and rendering, will succeed without exceptions.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose any API or public interface. It is a standalone application intended for testing purposes.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
