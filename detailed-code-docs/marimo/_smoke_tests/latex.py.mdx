## High-level description

The target file `marimo/_smoke_tests/latex.py` is a script designed to test the rendering of LaTeX mathematical expressions within the Marimo application framework. It uses the Marimo library to create a simple application that displays markdown content, including LaTeX equations, to verify that the rendering is functioning correctly. The script is structured to run as a standalone application when executed.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the Marimo application framework, utilizing the `@app.cell` decorator to define individual cells of functionality. Each cell is a function that performs a specific task, such as importing modules or rendering markdown content. The main symbols in the code are the `app` object, which is an instance of `marimo.App`, and the functions decorated with `@app.cell`, which define the behavior of the application.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object. It is used to define and run the application by registering functions as cells using the `@app.cell` decorator.

### `@app.cell` Decorated Functions
#### Description
These functions are decorated with `@app.cell`, indicating that they are part of the Marimo application. Each function is responsible for a specific task, such as importing modules or rendering markdown content.

#### Inputs
- The first function imports the `marimo` module and returns it.
- The second function takes the `marimo` module as input and renders a markdown header.
- The third function also takes the `marimo` module as input and renders a block of LaTeX equations.

#### Outputs
- The first function returns the `marimo` module.
- The second and third functions do not return any values; they perform actions (rendering markdown) instead.

#### Internal Logic
- The first function imports the `marimo` module and returns it for use in subsequent cells.
- The second function uses the `mo.md` method to render a markdown header that references a bug discussion.
- The third function uses the `mo.md` method to render a block of LaTeX equations, demonstrating the rendering capabilities of the application.

## Side Effects

- The functions render markdown content, which is a side effect of using the `mo.md` method. This affects the application's output by displaying the rendered content.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Used to create and manage the application, as well as render markdown content. |

## Error Handling

The code does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It relies on the Marimo framework to manage any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the application.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The code does not expose an API or public interface. It is designed to be run as a standalone script.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
