## High-level description

The target file `data_explorer.py` is a script that utilizes the `marimo` library to create a data exploration application. It allows users to select a dataset from a dropdown menu, load the selected dataset, and explore it using a data explorer UI component. The script is structured using `marimo`'s cell-based execution model, which organizes code into discrete, executable units.

## Code Structure

The script is organized into several `@app.cell` functions, each representing a step in the data exploration process. These cells are executed in sequence, with each cell's output potentially serving as input to subsequent cells. The main symbols in the code are the `marimo.App` instance `app` and the various `@app.cell` functions that define the application's behavior.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which serves as the main application object. It is configured with a full-width layout and is responsible for managing the execution of the cell functions.

### `@app.cell` functions
Each `@app.cell` function represents a step in the data exploration process. These functions are executed in sequence, with the output of one function potentially serving as input to the next.

#### Inputs and Outputs
The inputs and outputs of each cell function are determined by the parameters and return values of the functions. The inputs are typically the outputs of previous cells, and the outputs are used by subsequent cells.

#### Internal Logic
- The first cell imports necessary modules and returns them for use in subsequent cells.
- The second cell lists available datasets and creates a dropdown UI component for dataset selection.
- The third cell loads the selected dataset into a DataFrame.
- The fourth cell creates a data explorer UI component to visualize the DataFrame.
- The fifth cell accesses the value of the data explorer component, though it does not perform any further actions with it.

## Side Effects
- The script modifies the UI state by creating and updating UI components such as dropdowns and data explorers.
- It interacts with external datasets through the `vega_datasets` library.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Provides the framework for building the application and UI components. |
| `vega_datasets` | Supplies the datasets available for exploration. |

## Error Handling
The script does not explicitly handle errors. It relies on the `marimo` framework to manage execution flow and any potential errors that arise during cell execution.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
