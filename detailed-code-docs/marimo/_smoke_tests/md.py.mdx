## High-level description

The target file `marimo/_smoke_tests/md.py` is a script designed to test the markdown rendering capabilities of the Marimo library. It defines a series of cells within a Marimo application that render various markdown elements, such as tables, footnotes, and external links, to verify that these elements are displayed correctly in a Marimo notebook or app.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the Marimo library's `App` and `cell` decorators, which are used to define and execute individual cells within a Marimo application. Each cell is responsible for rendering a specific markdown element using the `mo.md` function from the Marimo library.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which represents a Marimo application. It is used to define and manage the execution of cells within the application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. Each cell is a function that can execute code and return results. In this script, each cell is responsible for rendering a specific markdown element.

### `__()`
#### Description
The `__()` function is a placeholder name for each cell function. Each instance of this function is decorated with `@app.cell` and is responsible for rendering a specific markdown element using the `mo.md` function.

#### Inputs
- `mo`: An alias for the `marimo` library, imported within the first cell.

#### Outputs
- None: The cells primarily perform rendering tasks and do not return values.

#### Internal Logic
Each cell uses the `mo.md` function to render markdown content. The content varies between cells, including headers, tables, footnotes, and links. The markdown content is passed as a string to the `mo.md` function, which handles the rendering.

## Side Effects
The script modifies the state of the Marimo application by rendering markdown content in each cell. This affects the visual output of the application when it is run.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | The primary library used to create and manage the Marimo application and render markdown content. |

## Error Handling
The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It assumes that the `mo.md` function and the Marimo library handle any errors related to markdown rendering.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone Marimo application.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
