## High-level description
The target file `marimo/_smoke_tests/nav_menus.py` is a script designed to test the navigation menu functionality of the Marimo application framework. It demonstrates the creation of both horizontal and vertical navigation menus with various levels of nested items, using icons and labels to represent different sections and subsections.

## Code Structure
The code is structured around the `marimo.App` class, which is used to define a series of cells. Each cell is a function decorated with `@app.cell`, and these functions are responsible for rendering different parts of the navigation menu and markdown content. The script uses the `mo` object, which is an instance of the Marimo framework, to call methods for rendering markdown and navigation menus.

## Symbols

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a cell within the Marimo application. Each cell represents a discrete unit of functionality or content that can be rendered by the application.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | object | An instance of the Marimo framework used to render content. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | None | The function does not return any value. |

#### Internal Logic
Each function decorated with `@app.cell` uses the `mo` object to render either markdown content or a navigation menu. The functions are executed in sequence to build the complete interface.

### `mo.md`
#### Description
The `mo.md` method is used to render markdown content within a cell. It takes a string of markdown text and displays it in the application.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| text | str | A string containing markdown-formatted text. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | None | The method does not return any value. |

### `mo.nav_menu`
#### Description
The `mo.nav_menu` method is used to create a navigation menu. It accepts a dictionary that defines the structure of the menu, including labels, icons, and nested items.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| menu_structure | dict | A dictionary defining the menu items and their hierarchy. |
| orientation | str | (Optional) The orientation of the menu, either "horizontal" or "vertical". |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | None | The method does not return any value. |

#### Internal Logic
The method processes the dictionary to render a navigation menu. It uses icons and labels to represent each menu item and supports nested structures for submenus.

## Side Effects
- The script modifies the state of the Marimo application by adding cells that render content and navigation menus.
- It uses the `mo` object to interact with the Marimo framework, which may have additional side effects depending on the framework's implementation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Provides the application framework and methods for rendering markdown and navigation menus. |

## Error Handling
The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms. It relies on the Marimo framework to manage any errors that occur during the rendering of content or menus.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms. Any logging would be handled by the Marimo framework if it provides such functionality.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone script to test the navigation menu functionality within the Marimo framework.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
