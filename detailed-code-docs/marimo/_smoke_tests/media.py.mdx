## High-level description

The target file `marimo/_smoke_tests/media.py` is a script designed to test various media functionalities within the Marimo framework. It demonstrates the use of audio, video, and image handling capabilities, including capturing audio input, displaying media, and enabling downloads. The script uses the Marimo framework to create a web application that showcases these functionalities through interactive UI components.

## Code Structure

The code is structured using the Marimo framework, which organizes the application into cells. Each cell is a function decorated with `@app.cell`, and these cells are executed in sequence to build the application. The script imports necessary libraries and defines several cells to handle different media types and interactions.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which serves as the main application object for the Marimo framework. It is used to define and run the application by organizing the code into cells.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. Each cell represents a unit of functionality, such as importing libraries, handling media, or creating UI components. The cells are executed in the order they are defined to build the application.

### `__()`
#### Description
The `__()` function is a placeholder name used for multiple cells in the script. Each occurrence of `__()` represents a different cell with specific functionality, such as importing libraries, handling audio input, or displaying media.

#### Inputs
- Various inputs depending on the cell, such as `mo`, `mic`, `BytesIO`, `base64`, `requests`.

#### Outputs
- Various outputs depending on the cell, such as `mic`, `base64str`, `image_data`.

#### Internal Logic
- The internal logic of each `__()` function varies. For example, one cell imports necessary libraries, another captures audio input using a microphone UI component, and another handles image data by downloading and encoding it in base64.

## Side Effects

- The script interacts with external resources, such as downloading media files from URLs and capturing audio input from the user's microphone.
- It modifies the UI state by creating and updating UI components like audio players, download buttons, and image displays.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Provides the framework for building the application and UI components. |
| `requests` | Used for making HTTP requests to download media files. |
| `BytesIO` | Used for handling binary data in memory. |
| `base64` | Used for encoding and decoding data in base64 format. |

## Error Handling

- The script includes a comment noting that Chrome does not support cross-origin downloads, indicating a potential issue with automatic downloads that needs to be addressed by proxying through the backend.

## Logging

- The script does not implement any explicit logging mechanisms.

## TODOs

- The script includes a comment about the need to proxy downloads through the backend to support cross-origin downloads in Chrome. This indicates a potential area for future development or improvement.
