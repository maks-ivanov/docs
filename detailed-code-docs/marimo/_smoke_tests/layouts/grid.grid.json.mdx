title: "grid.grid.json"

## High-level description
The JSON file defines a grid layout configuration for a user interface, specifying the grid's structure and the positions of various cells within it. The grid is composed of 12 columns, with each row having a height of 40 units, and it includes specific cell positions and dimensions within the grid.

## Code Structure
The JSON structure is organized into a main object with two primary keys: `type` and `data`. The `type` key indicates the layout type, which is a grid in this case. The `data` key contains the configuration details for the grid, including the number of columns, the height of each row, and an array of cell positions.

## Symbols

### `type`
#### Description
Specifies the type of layout being defined. In this file, it is set to "grid", indicating that the layout is a grid structure.

### `data`
#### Description
Contains the configuration details for the grid layout, including the number of columns, row height, and cell positions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| columns | integer | The number of columns in the grid. |
| rowHeight | integer | The height of each row in the grid. |
| cells | array | An array of cell position objects, each defining the position and span of a cell within the grid. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | This JSON structure is used for configuration and does not produce outputs in the traditional sense. |

### `cells`
#### Description
An array of objects, each representing a cell in the grid. Each cell object contains a `position` key that defines the cell's location and size within the grid.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| position | array or null | An array of four integers representing the cell's starting column, starting row, column span, and row span. A null value indicates an undefined or empty cell. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | The cell positions are part of the configuration and do not produce outputs. |

#### Internal Logic
The `position` array for each cell is structured as `[startColumn, startRow, columnSpan, rowSpan]`, which defines where the cell starts in the grid and how many columns and rows it spans.

## Side Effects
There are no side effects as this is a configuration file meant for defining a grid layout.

## Dependencies
There are no external dependencies in this JSON file. It is a standalone configuration.

## Configuration
The JSON file itself serves as a configuration for a grid layout. The key configuration options are:

| Option    | Type    | Default | Description                                      |
|:----------|:--------|:--------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| columns   | integer | 12      | The number of columns in the grid.               |
| rowHeight | integer | 40      | The height of each row in the grid.              |
| cells     | array   | N/A     | Defines the positions and spans of cells in the grid. |

## Error Handling
There is no error handling within this JSON file as it is purely a data structure for configuration purposes.

## Logging
There is no logging implemented in this JSON file.

## API/Interface Reference
This JSON file does not define an API or public interface. It is intended to be used as a configuration input for a system that interprets grid layouts.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
