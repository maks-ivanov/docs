## High-level description
The `marimo/_smoke_tests/layouts` directory contains JSON configuration files that define layout structures for user interfaces or presentation systems. These files specify different types of layouts, such as grid and slides, and provide the necessary configuration details to render these layouts in a user interface or display system. The directory includes two main JSON files: `grid.grid.json` and `slides.slides.json`, each serving a distinct purpose in layout configuration.

## What does it do?
The JSON files in this directory are used to configure the layout of user interfaces or presentation systems. 

- The `grid.grid.json` file defines a grid layout, specifying the number of columns, the height of each row, and the positions and dimensions of various cells within the grid. This configuration is useful for creating structured, grid-based layouts where elements are organized in a tabular format.

- The `slides.slides.json` file defines a layout for slide-based presentations. It specifies the layout type as "slides" and includes an empty data object, indicating that additional configuration or content can be added to customize the slides. This is useful for systems that need to display content in a sequential, slide-based format.

These configuration files are intended to be used by systems that interpret and render the specified layouts, allowing for flexible and customizable user interface designs.

## Entry points
The main files in this directory are `grid.grid.json` and `slides.slides.json`. These files serve as the entry points for defining grid and slide layouts, respectively. Each file is organized with a `type` key to specify the layout type and a `data` key to hold configuration details. The `grid.grid.json` file includes detailed configuration for grid layouts, while the `slides.slides.json` file is more of a template for slide layouts, with an empty data section ready for customization.
