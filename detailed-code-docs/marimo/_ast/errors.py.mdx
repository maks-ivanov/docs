## High-level description

The target file `marimo/_ast/errors.py` defines custom exception classes used within the Marimo application framework. These exceptions are designed to handle specific error conditions that may arise during the execution of Marimo applications, such as cycles in dataflow graphs, multiple definitions of the same entity, attempts to delete non-local variables, and unparsable code.

## Code Structure

The file contains four custom exception classes, each inheriting from Python's built-in `Exception` class. These classes are used to signal specific error conditions in the Marimo application framework.

## Symbols

### `CycleError`
#### Description
`CycleError` is a custom exception class used to indicate the presence of a cycle in a dataflow graph within a Marimo application. Cycles in dataflow graphs can lead to infinite loops or undefined behavior, so this exception is raised to prevent such issues.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

### `MultipleDefinitionError`
#### Description
`MultipleDefinitionError` is a custom exception class used to signal that multiple definitions of the same entity have been detected within a Marimo application. This can occur when the same variable or function is defined more than once, leading to ambiguity and potential errors.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

### `DeleteNonlocalError`
#### Description
`DeleteNonlocalError` is a custom exception class used to indicate an attempt to delete a non-local variable within a Marimo application. This is typically not allowed as it can lead to unexpected behavior and errors in the application.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

### `UnparsableError`
#### Description
`UnparsableError` is a custom exception class used to signal that a piece of code within a Marimo application cannot be parsed. This exception is raised when the syntax of the code is incorrect or when the code cannot be interpreted by the Marimo framework.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

## References

The exceptions defined in this file are referenced in the `marimo/_ast/app.py` file, where they are used to handle specific error conditions during the execution of Marimo applications. For example, `CycleError` is raised when a cycle is detected in the application's dataflow graph, and `UnparsableError` is raised when a cell in the application contains unparsable code.

## Dependencies

There are no external dependencies in this file. The exceptions are standalone and rely only on Python's built-in `Exception` class.

## Error Handling

The file defines custom exceptions for specific error conditions, allowing the Marimo framework to handle these conditions gracefully. By raising these exceptions, the framework can provide meaningful error messages and prevent the application from continuing in an invalid state.
