## High-level description

The directory contains two key files, `file_system.py` and `os_file_system.py`, which together define an interface and its implementation for interacting with a file system. The `file_system.py` file provides an abstract base class, `FileSystem`, which outlines a set of methods for file system operations such as listing files, retrieving file details, and managing files and directories. The `os_file_system.py` file implements this interface in the `OSFileSystem` class, using Python's built-in modules to perform these operations on a local operating system.

## What does it do?

The code in this directory is designed to provide a standardized way to interact with a file system, abstracting the details of file operations. Here's how it works:

1. **Defining the Interface**: The `FileSystem` abstract base class in `file_system.py` defines a set of methods that any file system interaction class should implement. This includes methods for listing files, getting file details, opening files, creating files or directories, deleting, moving, and updating files.

2. **Implementing the Interface**: The `OSFileSystem` class in `os_file_system.py` provides a concrete implementation of the `FileSystem` interface. It uses Python's `os`, `shutil`, and `mimetypes` modules to perform actual file system operations. This class can list files in a directory, retrieve detailed information about files, open and read file contents, create new files or directories, delete files or directories, move or rename them, and update file contents.

3. **Utility Functions**: The `OSFileSystem` class also includes utility functions for sorting files naturally and checking if a file is a Marimo application file, which involves reading the file content to look for specific indicators.

4. **Error Handling**: The implementation in `OSFileSystem` includes error handling using try-except blocks to manage potential `OSError` exceptions that might occur during file operations, ensuring the system remains robust against file system errors.

5. **Data Models**: The code interacts with data models `FileInfo` and `FileDetailsResponse` to structure and return information about files and directories in a consistent format.

Overall, this directory provides a flexible and extensible framework for file system interactions, which can be adapted for different environments or storage backends by implementing the `FileSystem` interface in different ways.
