## High-level description

The `marimo/_server/api/endpoints` directory contains a collection of API endpoint implementations for the Marimo application, a server-side application likely designed for interactive computing environments such as notebooks. These endpoints cover a wide range of functionalities, including AI completion, asset management, configuration handling, data source interaction, documentation serving, editing operations, execution management, file export, file exploration, file management, health checks, home page interactions, login processes, terminal sessions, and WebSocket communication. The endpoints are implemented using the Starlette framework and are organized to handle HTTP requests and WebSocket connections, providing a comprehensive API for managing various aspects of the application.

## What does it do?

The directory provides a robust API for interacting with the Marimo application, enabling users to perform a variety of tasks:

- **AI Completion**: Handles requests for AI-generated content using OpenAI's API, supporting different content types like Python, markdown, and SQL.
- **Asset Management**: Serves static files and virtual files, and renders HTML pages for the application.
- **Configuration Handling**: Allows users to save and update configuration settings, ensuring that only authenticated users can make changes.
- **Data Source Interaction**: Provides functionality to preview dataset columns, requiring authentication for access.
- **Documentation Serving**: Loads and returns documentation snippets for the application.
- **Editing Operations**: Supports various editing tasks such as code completion, cell deletion, code formatting, and package installation.
- **Execution Management**: Manages operations like setting UI element values, running code cells, and restarting sessions.
- **File Export**: Exports notebook content in formats like HTML, script, and markdown.
- **File Exploration**: Manages files and directories, allowing operations like listing, creating, deleting, and moving files.
- **File Management**: Handles file operations such as reading, renaming, opening, and saving files.
- **Health Checks**: Provides endpoints for checking the application's health, version, status, and resource usage.
- **Home Page Interactions**: Manages recent files, workspace files, running notebooks, and session shutdowns.
- **Login Processes**: Implements login functionality, including serving a login page and processing login submissions.
- **Terminal Sessions**: Facilitates terminal interactions over WebSocket connections, allowing users to interact with a shell.
- **WebSocket Communication**: Manages real-time communication between clients and the server, supporting session management and message exchange.

These endpoints collectively enable users to interact with the Marimo application in a flexible and secure manner, supporting both HTTP and WebSocket protocols for a wide range of operations.
