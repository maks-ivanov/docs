## High-level description

The target file `marimo/_server/models/home.py` defines several data models using Python's `dataclasses` module. These models are used to represent various entities and requests/responses related to file management and session handling in the Marimo application. The file includes models for representing files, recent files, running notebooks, workspace file requests and responses, and session shutdown requests.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are data classes that represent different entities and operations related to file and session management. These data classes are interconnected through their usage in API endpoints and other parts of the application, as seen in the related files.

## Symbols

### `MarimoFile`
#### Description
Represents a file in the Marimo application, including its name, path, last modified time, and associated session information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | The name of the file. |
| path | str | The absolute path to the file. |
| last_modified | Optional[float] | The last modified timestamp of the file. |
| session_id | Optional[SessionId] | The session ID associated with the file. |
| initialization_id | Optional[str] | The ID for when the session was initialized. |

#### Outputs
N/A

### `RecentFilesResponse`
#### Description
Represents a response containing a list of recent files.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| files | List[MarimoFile] | A list of recent files. |

#### Outputs
N/A

### `RunningNotebooksResponse`
#### Description
Represents a response containing a list of running notebooks.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| files | List[MarimoFile] | A list of running notebooks. |

#### Outputs
N/A

### `WorkspaceFilesRequest`
#### Description
Represents a request to retrieve files in a workspace, with an option to include markdown files.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| include_markdown | bool | Whether to include markdown files in the response. |

#### Outputs
N/A

### `WorkspaceFilesResponse`
#### Description
Represents a response containing the root directory and a list of files in the workspace.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| root | str | The root directory of the workspace. |
| files | List[FileInfo] | A list of files in the workspace. |

#### Outputs
N/A

### `ShutdownSessionRequest`
#### Description
Represents a request to shut down a session.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| session_id | SessionId | The ID of the session to shut down. |

#### Outputs
N/A

## References

- `SessionId`: Defined in `marimo/_server/ids.py`, used to represent session identifiers.
- `FileInfo`: Defined in `marimo/_server/models/files.py`, used to represent file information.

## Dependencies

The code uses the following external modules:
- `dataclasses`: For defining data classes.
- `typing`: For type annotations, including `List` and `Optional`.

## Error Handling

The code does not implement specific error handling mechanisms as it primarily defines data models.

## Logging

The code does not implement logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The data models defined in this file are used in various API endpoints, as seen in the related file `marimo/_server/api/endpoints/home.py`. These endpoints handle requests and responses related to recent files, running notebooks, workspace files, and session shutdowns.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
