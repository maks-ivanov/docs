## High-level description

The target file, `export.py`, defines data structures for handling export requests in different formats: HTML, script, and Markdown. These data structures are used to encapsulate the necessary parameters for exporting content, such as whether the export should be downloaded and additional options specific to each format.

## Code Structure

The file contains three data classes: `ExportAsHTMLRequest`, `ExportAsScriptRequest`, and `ExportAsMarkdownRequest`. Each class is designed to hold the parameters required for exporting content in the respective format. These classes are used in various parts of the codebase to facilitate the export functionality.

## Symbols

### `ExportAsHTMLRequest`
#### Description
This data class represents a request to export content as HTML. It includes options for downloading the export, specifying files to include, and whether to include code in the export.

#### Inputs
| Name         | Type    | Description                                      |
|:-------------|:--------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| download     | bool    | Indicates if the export should be downloaded.    |
| files        | List[str] | List of file paths to include in the export.    |
| include_code | bool    | Specifies if code should be included in the export. |
| asset_url    | Optional[str] | URL for additional assets, if any.          |

#### Outputs
This class does not produce outputs directly but serves as a container for input parameters.

### `ExportAsScriptRequest`
#### Description
This data class represents a request to export content as a script. It includes an option for downloading the export.

#### Inputs
| Name     | Type | Description                                   |
|:---------|:-----|:----------------------------------------------|
| download | bool | Indicates if the export should be downloaded. |

#### Outputs
This class does not produce outputs directly but serves as a container for input parameters.

### `ExportAsMarkdownRequest`
#### Description
This data class represents a request to export content as Markdown. It includes an option for downloading the export.

#### Inputs
| Name     | Type | Description                                   |
|:---------|:-----|:----------------------------------------------|
| download | bool | Indicates if the export should be downloaded. |

#### Outputs
This class does not produce outputs directly but serves as a container for input parameters.

## References

The data classes defined in this file are referenced in other parts of the codebase, particularly in modules that handle export operations. For instance, they are used in the `marimo/_cli/development/commands.py` and `marimo/_server/api/endpoints/export.py` files to facilitate the export functionality.

## Dependencies

The file uses the following Python standard libraries:
- `dataclasses`: To define the data classes.
- `typing`: For type hinting, including `List` and `Optional`.

## Error Handling

The file does not implement any specific error handling mechanisms as it primarily defines data structures.

## Logging

There are no logging mechanisms implemented in this file.

## API/Interface Reference

The data classes in this file are used as part of the API for handling export requests. They are referenced in API endpoints to parse and validate incoming requests for exporting content in different formats.
