title: "test_base.py"

## High-level description

The target file `test_base.py` contains unit tests for two functions, `to_camel_case` and `deep_to_camel_case`, which are defined in the related file `base.py`. These functions are used to convert strings and data structures from snake_case to camelCase. The tests ensure that these functions behave as expected across various input scenarios, including simple strings, nested dictionaries, and lists of dictionaries.

## Code Structure

The target file is structured around two main test functions: `test_camel_case` and `test_deep_to_camel_case`. Each of these functions tests a corresponding function from the `base.py` file. The tests use Python's `assert` statements to verify that the output of the functions matches the expected results.

## References

- `to_camel_case`: A function from `base.py` that converts a snake_case string to camelCase.
- `deep_to_camel_case`: A function from `base.py` that recursively converts keys in a dictionary (and nested structures) from snake_case to camelCase.

## Symbols

### `test_camel_case`
#### Description
This function tests the `to_camel_case` function to ensure it correctly converts snake_case strings to camelCase.

#### Inputs
No direct inputs; uses hardcoded test cases.

#### Outputs
No direct outputs; uses assertions to validate behavior.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests various cases including simple strings, strings with numbers, empty strings, and strings that are already in camelCase.
- Uses `assert` statements to compare the output of `to_camel_case` with expected results.

### `test_deep_to_camel_case`
#### Description
This function tests the `deep_to_camel_case` function to ensure it correctly converts keys in dictionaries (including nested dictionaries and lists of dictionaries) from snake_case to camelCase.

#### Inputs
No direct inputs; uses hardcoded test cases.

#### Outputs
No direct outputs; uses assertions to validate behavior.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests various structures including simple dictionaries, nested dictionaries, lists of dictionaries, and mixed types.
- Uses `assert` statements to compare the output of `deep_to_camel_case` with expected results.

## Dependencies

The target file depends on the `base.py` file for the `to_camel_case` and `deep_to_camel_case` functions.

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo._server.models.base` | Provides the `to_camel_case` and `deep_to_camel_case` functions for testing. |

## Error Handling

The test functions rely on Python's `assert` statements for error handling. If an assertion fails, it raises an `AssertionError`, indicating that the function did not produce the expected result.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in the target file. The focus is on using assertions to validate function behavior.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code. The file appears to be complete and focused on its purpose of testing the conversion functions.
