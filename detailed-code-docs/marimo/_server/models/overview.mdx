## High-level description

The `marimo/_server/models` directory contains a collection of Python files that define data models and utility functions for the Marimo application. These models are primarily used for handling requests and responses related to file operations, AI completion requests, export functionalities, and other server-side operations. The directory leverages Python's `dataclasses` module to create structured representations of data, ensuring consistency and ease of use across the application.

## What does it do?

The code in this directory facilitates various workflows within the Marimo application:

1. **String and Key Conversion**: The `base.py` file provides utility functions to convert strings and dictionary keys from snake_case to camelCase. This is crucial for maintaining consistent naming conventions, especially when interfacing with systems or APIs that expect camelCase formatting.

2. **AI Completion Requests**: The `completion.py` file defines a data model for AI completion requests. It structures the data needed to request code completions from AI models, including the prompt, additional code context, and the programming language.

3. **Export Functionality**: The `export.py` file contains data models for handling export requests in different formats such as HTML, script, and Markdown. These models encapsulate the parameters required for exporting content, like download options and format-specific settings.

4. **File Operations**: The `files.py` file defines data models for various file operations, including listing files, retrieving file details, opening files, and creating, deleting, moving, and updating files. These models are used to structure requests and responses for file management tasks.

5. **Home and Session Management**: The `home.py` file includes models for managing files and sessions within the Marimo application. It defines structures for recent files, running notebooks, workspace file requests, and session shutdown requests.

6. **General Models**: The `models.py` file provides a set of data structures for handling general requests and responses, such as executing code, renaming files, and updating UI components. These models are part of a larger system for managing code execution and configuration.

7. **Testing**: The `test_base.py` file contains unit tests for the conversion functions in `base.py`, ensuring they work correctly across various input scenarios.

Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in structuring data and facilitating communication between different components of the Marimo application, enabling efficient handling of server-side operations.
