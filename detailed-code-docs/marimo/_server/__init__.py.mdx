The target file `marimo/_server/__init__.py` is essentially an empty file with only a copyright notice. This file is part of a Python package, as indicated by its location within a directory structure and its naming convention (`__init__.py`).

## High-level description
The primary purpose of this file is to serve as an initializer for the `marimo._server` package. In Python, the presence of an `__init__.py` file in a directory indicates that the directory should be treated as a package. This allows the package to be imported and used in other parts of the codebase.
