## High-level description

The target file, `exceptions.py`, defines a custom exception class `InvalidSessionException` that extends Python's built-in `Exception` class. This custom exception is used to signal errors related to invalid sessions within the Marimo server application, which manages client sessions, Python kernels, and websocket connections.

## Code Structure

The `InvalidSessionException` class is a simple extension of the base `Exception` class, designed to encapsulate error messages related to session management. It is used in the broader context of the Marimo server's session management system, as seen in the related `sessions.py` file.

## Symbols

### `InvalidSessionException`
#### Description
The `InvalidSessionException` class is a custom exception used to indicate errors related to invalid sessions in the Marimo server application. It is a subclass of Python's built-in `Exception` class and is initialized with a message that describes the error.

#### Inputs
| Name    | Type | Description                |
|:--------|:-----|:---------------------------|
| message | str  | A descriptive error message |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | None | This class does not return a value; it raises an exception. |

#### Internal Logic
The class constructor (`__init__`) takes a single string argument `message` and passes it to the superclass constructor (`super().__init__(message)`) to initialize the exception with the provided message.

## References

The `InvalidSessionException` is referenced in the `sessions.py` file, where it is used to handle scenarios where multiple sessions exist while editing, which is not allowed. Specifically, it is raised in the `SessionManager` class's `maybe_resume_session` method when more than one session is found for a given file in edit mode.

## Dependencies

There are no external dependencies in the `exceptions.py` file, as it only defines a custom exception class.

## Error Handling

The `InvalidSessionException` is part of the error handling strategy in the Marimo server application. It is used to signal specific session-related errors, allowing the application to handle these cases appropriately, such as logging the error or notifying the user.

## Logging

The `InvalidSessionException` itself does not implement logging, but it is likely that the broader application context in which it is used includes logging mechanisms to record when this exception is raised and handled.
