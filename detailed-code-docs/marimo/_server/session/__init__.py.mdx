title: "__init__.py"
---

It seems that the `__init__.py` file in the `marion` module's `session` sub-directory is currently empty, aside from the presence of a comment indicating the file's ownership and a placeholder for any potential future content. This is a common practice in many projects, especially those that are part of a larger codebase, to ensure that the module is properly initialized and to manage the inclusion of any necessary imports or initial configurations.

Here are some key points to consider:

- **Purpose of `__init__.py`**: This file is typically used to initialize the module and can contain code that is necessary for the module to function properly. It can also be used to manage imports and other necessary initial configurations.

- **Future Development**: The presence of the `__init__` file indicates that the module is intended to be used in some way, and it may be a part of the application that is being developed or maintained. It is common for the content of the file to be populated later as the application is being developed or maintained.

- **Project Structure**: The presence of this file is a part of the convention for Python projects, which helps in organizing the code and ensuring that the application is properly initialized.

- **Version Control**: The presence of the file in the repository, even if it is currently empty, is important for version control and for tracking the development of the application.

In the context of the whole project, this file is a placeholder for future code that will be used to initialize the session module. It is a part of the ongoing development and maintenance of the application. If there are any other files or modules that are part of the project, they may be relevant to the development of this module. It is important to keep track of the development of the application and to ensure that the necessary information is included in the application. This is a common practice in many projects, and it is important to ensure that the application is properly initialized and maintained.
