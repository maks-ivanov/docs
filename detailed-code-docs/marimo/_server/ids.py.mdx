## High-level description

The target file `marimo/_server/ids.py` defines two type aliases, `SessionId` and `ConsumerId`, both of which are strings. These type aliases are used throughout the codebase to represent unique identifiers for sessions and consumers, respectively. This file serves as a central place to define these identifiers, ensuring consistency and clarity across the codebase.

## Code Structure

The file is very simple and contains only two type alias definitions. These aliases are used in various parts of the codebase to represent session and consumer identifiers, which are crucial for managing sessions and consumers in the application.

## Symbols

### `SessionId`
#### Description
`SessionId` is a type alias for `str`. It is used to represent a unique identifier for a session within the application. This alias helps in maintaining a consistent type for session identifiers across the codebase.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
There is no internal logic as this is a type alias.

### `ConsumerId`
#### Description
`ConsumerId` is a type alias for `str`. It is used to represent a unique identifier for a consumer within the application. This alias ensures that consumer identifiers are consistently treated as strings throughout the codebase.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
There is no internal logic as this is a type alias.

## References

- **`SessionId`**: This alias is used in various parts of the codebase, such as in `marimo/_server/api/deps.py`, `marimo/_server/models/home.py`, and `marimo/_server/sessions.py`. It is used to identify sessions in functions and classes that manage or interact with sessions.
  
- **`ConsumerId`**: This alias is used in files like `marimo/_server/model.py` and `marimo/_server/sessions.py`. It is used to identify consumers in classes and functions that manage or interact with consumers.

## Dependencies

There are no external dependencies in this file. The file only uses Python's built-in `str` type to define the type aliases.

## Conclusion

The `marimo/_server/ids.py` file is a straightforward and essential part of the codebase, providing type aliases for session and consumer identifiers. These aliases are used throughout the application to ensure consistent and clear handling of session and consumer IDs.
