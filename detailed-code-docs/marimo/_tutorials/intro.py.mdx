## High-level description

The target file, `marimo/_tutorials/intro.py`, is a tutorial script for the Marimo reactive Python notebook framework. It demonstrates the basic features and functionalities of Marimo, such as reactive execution, UI elements, and the ability to run notebooks as applications. The script is structured to guide users through an interactive introduction to Marimo's capabilities, including automatic cell execution, UI interactions, and the use of Marimo's command-line tools.

## Code Structure

The script is organized into multiple cells, each decorated with `@app.cell`, which is a feature of the Marimo framework to define executable blocks of code. These cells are used to demonstrate various aspects of Marimo, such as markdown rendering, UI element creation, and reactive execution. The script also includes hidden cells that provide additional tips and explanations to the user.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which serves as the main application object for the Marimo notebook. It is used to manage the execution of cells and the overall notebook environment.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell in the Marimo notebook. Each function decorated with `@app.cell` represents a cell that can contain code, UI elements, or markdown content. The decorator allows for the specification of additional parameters, such as `hide_code`, to control the visibility of the cell's code.

### `mo.md`
#### Description
`mo.md` is a function from the Marimo library used to render markdown content within a cell. It allows for the inclusion of formatted text, headings, and other markdown features in the notebook.

### `mo.ui.slider`
#### Description
`mo.ui.slider` creates a slider UI element that users can interact with. The slider's value can be used in other cells to demonstrate Marimo's reactive execution capabilities.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| start | int | The starting value of the slider. |
| stop | int | The ending value of the slider. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| slider | Slider | A slider UI element that users can interact with. |

### `mo.accordion`
#### Description
`mo.accordion` is used to create an accordion UI element, which can contain expandable sections of content. It is used in the tutorial to provide additional tips and explanations.

### `mo.ui.dropdown`
#### Description
`mo.ui.dropdown` creates a dropdown UI element that allows users to select from a list of options. It is used in the tutorial to demonstrate interactive UI elements.

### `mo.ui.text`
#### Description
`mo.ui.text` creates a text input UI element. It is used in the tutorial to demonstrate how text inputs can be integrated into Marimo notebooks.

### `mo.ui.button`
#### Description
`mo.ui.button` creates a button UI element that can trigger actions when clicked. It is used in the tutorial to demonstrate interactive elements and state management.

## References

- The script references the `marimo` library extensively, utilizing its features for creating reactive notebooks and UI elements.
- The script also references various UI components from the `marimo.ui` module, such as sliders, dropdowns, and buttons.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Provides the framework for creating reactive notebooks and UI elements. |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors, as it is primarily a tutorial designed to demonstrate features rather than manage complex error scenarios.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms, as it is focused on interactive demonstration rather than logging execution details.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API, as it is intended to be run as a standalone tutorial within the Marimo framework.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
