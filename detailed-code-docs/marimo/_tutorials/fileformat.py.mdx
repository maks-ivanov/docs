title: "fileformat.py"

## High-level description

The target file, `fileformat.py`, is part of the Marimo library's tutorial suite. It is designed to demonstrate the file format used by Marimo applications, which are stored as pure Python files. The tutorial explains the properties and benefits of this format, such as its readability, version control friendliness, and the ability to be edited and formatted using standard text editors and code formatters.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the `marimo.App` class, which is used to create a Marimo application. The application is composed of several cells, each defined by the `@app.cell` decorator. These cells are used to present different parts of the tutorial, such as introductory text, example programs, and explanations of the file format's properties.

## Symbols

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. Each cell can contain code or markdown content that is executed or displayed when the application runs. The decorator allows the encapsulation of logic or content in a modular way, similar to functions in a script.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Various | Varies | Each cell can take different inputs depending on its purpose, such as markdown content or example code. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Various | Varies | Outputs depend on the cell's content, such as rendered markdown or executed code. |

#### Internal Logic
The internal logic of each cell is straightforward, typically involving rendering markdown content or displaying example code. The cells are designed to be hidden (`hide_code=True`) to focus on the tutorial content rather than the underlying code.

### `marimo.App`
#### Description
The `marimo.App` class is used to create an instance of a Marimo application. This instance manages the lifecycle of the application, including the execution of cells and the rendering of content.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | N/A | The class is instantiated without parameters. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| app | `marimo.App` | An instance of the Marimo application. |

## References

The file references the `marimo` library, specifically the `marimo.App` class and the `@app.cell` decorator. These are crucial for understanding how the tutorial is structured and how the Marimo application is built and executed.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Provides the core functionality for creating and managing Marimo applications, including the `App` class and `@app.cell` decorator. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors, as it primarily focuses on rendering tutorial content. However, Marimo's framework likely includes mechanisms to handle errors related to cell execution and content rendering.

## Logging

The code does not implement logging, as its primary purpose is to serve as a tutorial for the Marimo file format.

## API/Interface Reference

The file does not expose an API or public interface, as it is intended to be a tutorial script within the Marimo framework.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code. The file appears to be complete and focused on its tutorial purpose.
