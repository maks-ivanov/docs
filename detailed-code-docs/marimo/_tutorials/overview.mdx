## High-level description

The `marimo/_tutorials` directory is a collection of tutorial scripts designed to introduce users to the Marimo framework, a reactive Python notebook environment. These tutorials cover a wide range of topics, including basic features, UI elements, dataflow execution, file formats, and integration with SQL and plotting libraries. Each tutorial is structured as a series of cells, leveraging Marimo's capabilities to create interactive and dynamic content.

## What does it do?

The tutorials in this directory serve as educational resources to help users understand and effectively use the Marimo framework. They demonstrate how to create and manage reactive notebooks, utilize various UI components, and integrate external libraries for data visualization and analysis. Users can interact with the tutorials by executing cells, adjusting UI elements, and observing the reactive execution model in action. This hands-on approach allows users to learn by doing, making it easier to grasp the concepts and features of Marimo.

## Entry points

The main files in the directory are:

- `__init__.py`: Manages and retrieves the source content of various tutorials, categorizing them into Python and Markdown tutorials.
- `intro.py`: Provides an introduction to Marimo's basic features and functionalities.
- `for_jupyter_users.py`: Introduces Jupyter users to Marimo, highlighting key differences and features.
- `dataflow.py`: Demonstrates the concept of reactive execution in Marimo notebooks.
- `fileformat.py`: Explains the file format used by Marimo applications.
- `layout.py`: Showcases layout functionalities in Marimo, such as arranging UI components and creating grids.
- `markdown.py`: Demonstrates how to render Markdown, integrate LaTeX, and interpolate Python values in Marimo.
- `plots.py`: Focuses on using plotting libraries like `matplotlib` within Marimo.
- `sql.py`: Guides users through integrating SQL within a Marimo environment.
- `ui.py`: Demonstrates the use of interactive UI elements in Marimo applications.
