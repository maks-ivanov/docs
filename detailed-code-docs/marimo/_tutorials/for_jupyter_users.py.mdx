## High-level description

The target file, `for_jupyter_users.py`, is a tutorial script designed to introduce Jupyter users to the Marimo notebook environment. It highlights the key differences between Jupyter and Marimo, focusing on features like reactive execution, built-in interactive elements, and the ability to share notebooks as web apps. The script is structured as a series of cells that demonstrate these features through explanations and code examples.

## Code Structure

The script is organized into a series of cells, each defined by the `@app.cell` decorator. These cells are used to demonstrate various features of Marimo, such as reactive execution and UI elements. The `marimo.App` class is used to create an application instance, which manages the execution of these cells. Markdown content is rendered using the `mo.md` method, and interactive UI elements are created using the `mo.ui` module.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
The `app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object for the Marimo notebook. It manages the execution of cells and the overall notebook environment.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo notebook. Each cell can contain Python code or Markdown content, and can optionally hide the code from the user interface.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | object | An instance of the Marimo module, used for rendering Markdown and creating UI elements. |

#### Outputs
Varies depending on the cell content, typically includes rendered Markdown or UI elements.

#### Internal Logic
- Cells marked with `hide_code=True` are used to render Markdown content without displaying the underlying code.
- Cells can define variables and demonstrate reactive execution by showing how changes in one cell affect others.

## Side Effects
- The script modifies the notebook's UI by rendering Markdown and creating interactive elements.
- It demonstrates the reactive execution model by automatically updating dependent cells when a variable changes.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Provides the core functionality for creating and managing Marimo notebooks, including reactive execution and UI elements. |

## Error Handling
The script does not explicitly handle errors, but it demonstrates Marimo's approach to variable re-assignment errors by explaining why re-assignment is disallowed and offering solutions.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose an API but serves as an interactive tutorial for users to learn about Marimo's features.

## TODOs
None

This tutorial script is a comprehensive guide for Jupyter users transitioning to Marimo, showcasing its unique features and providing practical examples to illustrate its capabilities.
