## High-level description

The target file, `marimo/_tutorials/ui.py`, is a tutorial script for the Marimo framework, which demonstrates the use of interactive user interface (UI) elements within a Marimo application. It showcases how to create and interact with various UI components, such as sliders, buttons, and composite elements, and explains the concept of reactive execution, where interacting with UI elements triggers the execution of dependent cells.

## Code Structure

The script is structured as a series of cells, each defined using the `@app.cell` decorator from the Marimo framework. These cells are executed in a reactive manner, meaning that changes to UI elements or state variables automatically trigger the execution of dependent cells. The script is organized into sections that introduce different UI elements, explain how interactions work, and demonstrate the use of state management in Marimo applications.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object for the Marimo framework. It is used to define and manage the execution of cells within the application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. Each cell can contain code that defines UI elements, manipulates state, or performs other operations. Cells can be configured to hide their code or to be reactive to changes in UI elements or state variables.

### `mo.ui.slider`
#### Description
Creates a slider UI element with specified start, stop, and step values. The slider's value can be accessed and used to trigger reactive execution of dependent cells.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| start | int | The starting value of the slider. |
| stop | int | The ending value of the slider. |
| step | int | The increment step for the slider. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| slider | Slider | A slider UI element. |

### `mo.state`
#### Description
Creates a state variable with an initial value and returns a getter and setter function. The state can be used to maintain and update values across different cells, enabling reactive execution when the state changes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| initial_value | Any | The initial value of the state. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| get_state | Callable | A function to get the current state value. |
| set_state | Callable | A function to set a new state value. |

### `mo.ui.button`
#### Description
Creates a button UI element that can trigger actions when clicked. It can be configured with an `on_change` callback to perform specific operations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| label | str | The label displayed on the button. |
| on_change | Callable | A callback function executed when the button is clicked. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| button | Button | A button UI element. |

## Side Effects

- The script modifies the global state by defining and updating state variables using `mo.state`.
- UI interactions trigger the execution of dependent cells, which can lead to changes in the application's state and output.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Provides the framework for creating reactive Python applications with UI elements. |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors beyond the basic functionality provided by the Marimo framework. It assumes that UI interactions and state updates are performed correctly.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms. It relies on the Marimo framework's default behavior for handling outputs and interactions.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone tutorial within the Marimo framework.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
