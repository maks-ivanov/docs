## High-level description

The target file, `marimo/_tutorials/plots.py`, is a tutorial script for the Marimo framework that demonstrates how to use various plotting libraries, primarily focusing on `matplotlib`. It provides examples of creating and displaying plots within Marimo's cell-based application structure, highlighting both imperative and object-oriented approaches to plotting. The script also includes interactive elements using Marimo's UI components.

## Code Structure

The script is structured around the `marimo.App` framework, which organizes code into cells using the `@app.cell` decorator. Each cell can contain code to execute, markdown for documentation, or UI elements for interaction. The script uses these cells to guide users through different plotting techniques and concepts.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which serves as the main application object for organizing and running the tutorial. It manages the execution of cells and the rendering of outputs.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo application. Each cell can contain code, markdown, or UI elements, and is executed in the order it appears in the script.

### `__()`
#### Description
The function `__()` is used multiple times throughout the script, each time with different parameters. It serves as a placeholder for various operations, such as rendering markdown, plotting with `matplotlib`, or creating UI elements.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | marimo | Used for rendering markdown and UI elements. |
| plt | matplotlib.pyplot | Used for creating plots. |
| x | numpy.ndarray | An array of values used for plotting. |
| exponent | marimo.ui.slider | A UI slider element for interactive plotting. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | varies | The output depends on the cell's content, such as a plot or markdown. |

#### Internal Logic
The internal logic of each `__()` function varies based on its purpose. For example, some functions render markdown using `mo.md()`, while others create plots using `plt.plot()`. Interactive elements are created using Marimo's UI components, such as sliders.

### `check_dependencies`
#### Description
A function defined within a cell to check for missing dependencies required by the tutorial, specifically `numpy` and `matplotlib`.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| module_not_found_explainer | marimo.md | A markdown warning if dependencies are missing. |

### `plt_show_explainer`
#### Description
A dictionary containing explanations about using `plt.show()` in the context of Marimo, returned by a cell for documentation purposes.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Framework for creating interactive tutorials and applications. |
| `matplotlib` | Library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python. |
| `numpy` | Library for numerical computations in Python. |

## Error Handling

The script includes a mechanism to check for missing dependencies (`numpy` and `matplotlib`) and provides a markdown warning if they are not installed.

## Logging

No explicit logging mechanisms are implemented in the script.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API but provides an interactive interface through Marimo's cell-based structure, allowing users to execute and interact with code cells.

## TODOs

No TODOs or notes are present in the code.
