## High-level description

The `dataflow.py` file is part of the Marimo library's tutorial section, specifically focusing on demonstrating the concept of reactive execution in Marimo notebooks. It explains how Marimo uses a dataflow graph to manage the execution of cells based on their dependencies, and provides examples and best practices for using this feature effectively.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the concept of Marimo cells, which are defined using the `@app.cell` decorator. Each cell can contain markdown content or executable code, and the cells are interconnected through a dataflow graph. The file includes several examples to illustrate how cells interact based on their defined global variables and dependencies.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object for managing the execution of cells in a Marimo notebook.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell within the Marimo notebook. Each cell can contain code or markdown content, and the decorator allows for additional configuration such as hiding code or disabling automatic execution.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | object | An instance of the Marimo object used for rendering markdown and managing cell execution. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | varies | The output of the cell, which can be markdown content or the result of executed code. |

#### Internal Logic
The decorator manages the execution of the cell based on its dependencies and the current state of the dataflow graph. It ensures that cells are executed in the correct order and handles the rendering of markdown content.

### `plot_wave`
#### Description
A function defined within a cell that plots a sine wave using the given amplitude and period. It checks for the presence of required libraries (`numpy` and `matplotlib`) before attempting to plot.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| amplitude | float | The amplitude of the sine wave. |
| period | float | The period of the sine wave. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| plot | object | The plot object created by `matplotlib`. |

#### Internal Logic
The function uses `numpy` to generate x-values and `matplotlib` to plot the sine wave. It includes checks to ensure the necessary libraries are installed before proceeding with the plot.

## Side Effects

- The execution of cells can modify global variables, which in turn can trigger the execution of dependent cells.
- The code includes examples that demonstrate how deleting a cell affects the global state and triggers re-execution of dependent cells.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Provides the core functionality for creating and managing Marimo notebooks. |
| `numpy` | Used for numerical operations and generating data for plots. |
| `matplotlib` | Used for plotting graphs and visualizing data. |

## Error Handling

The code includes examples of error handling related to the presence of required libraries (`numpy` and `matplotlib`). If these libraries are not installed, the code provides a markdown message indicating the missing dependency.

## Logging

The code does not explicitly implement logging, but it uses markdown to provide feedback and instructions to the user within the notebook.

## API/Interface Reference

The file does not expose an external API but provides an interface for defining and executing cells within a Marimo notebook. The `@app.cell` decorator is the primary interface for interacting with the notebook's execution model.

## TODOs

There are no explicit TODOs or notes left in the code. The file is structured as a tutorial, providing guidance and examples for users to understand and utilize Marimo's dataflow execution model effectively.
