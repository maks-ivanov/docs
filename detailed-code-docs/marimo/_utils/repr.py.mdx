## High-level description

The target file `marimo/_utils/repr.py` contains a utility function `format_repr` that is designed to generate a string representation of an object. This function takes an object and a dictionary of key-value pairs, and returns a formatted string that represents the object in a human-readable way, typically for debugging purposes.

## Code Structure

The file contains a single function, `format_repr`, which is a utility function used to format the string representation of an object. This function is standalone and does not interact with other symbols within the file.

## Symbols

### `format_repr`
#### Description
The `format_repr` function is a utility function that formats a string representation of an object. It takes an object and a dictionary of attributes, and returns a string that represents the object in a format similar to how Python's built-in `repr` function would display it. This is useful for creating custom string representations for objects, especially for debugging and logging purposes.

#### Inputs
| Name  | Type         | Description                                      |
|:------|:-------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| `obj` | `Any`        | The object for which the representation is being formatted. |
| `items` | `dict[str, Any]` | A dictionary containing attribute names and their corresponding values. |

#### Outputs
| Name    | Type   | Description                                      |
|:--------|:-------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| `output` | `str`  | A formatted string representing the object and its attributes. |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function iterates over the `items` dictionary, creating a list of strings where each string is formatted as `key=value`.
2. It then joins these strings with a comma and space, resulting in a single string that lists all key-value pairs.
3. Finally, it returns a string that includes the class name of the object and the formatted key-value pairs, enclosed in parentheses.

## References

The `format_repr` function is referenced in the `marimo/_server/sessions.py` file, where it is used in the `__repr__` method of the `Session` class. This indicates that the function is utilized to provide a string representation of `Session` objects, which likely aids in debugging and logging.

## Dependencies

The file imports `Any` from the `typing` module to allow for type hinting of the function parameters and return type. This is the only external dependency in the file.

| Dependency | Purpose                                      |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------------|
| `typing.Any` | Used for type hinting to indicate that the function can accept any type of object and dictionary values. |

## Error Handling

The function does not include explicit error handling. It assumes that the `items` parameter is a dictionary with string keys and that the object has a `__class__.__name__` attribute. If these assumptions are violated, Python's built-in exceptions will be raised.

## Logging

The function does not implement any logging mechanisms. It is a simple utility function focused on formatting strings.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
