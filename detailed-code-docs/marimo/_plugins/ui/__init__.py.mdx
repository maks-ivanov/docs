## High-level description

The `marimo/_plugins/ui/__init__.py` file serves as an initializer for a module that provides a library of interactive UI elements. It imports and exposes various UI components from their respective implementation files, making them available for use in other parts of the application. These components include elements like charts, buttons, sliders, tables, and more, which are used to build interactive user interfaces.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the UI elements listed in the `__all__` array. Each element corresponds to a specific UI component that is imported from its respective implementation module. These components are then made available for external use by including them in the `__all__` list, which defines the public API of the module.

## References

The file references several implementation modules within the `marimo._plugins.ui._impl` package. Each UI element is imported from its corresponding module, such as `altair_chart` from `altair_chart.py`, `array` from `array.py`, and so on. These references are crucial for understanding the source of each UI component.
