## High-level description

The directory is part of a larger system designed to manage and interact with various types of table-like data structures. It provides a framework and utilities for handling data in different formats, such as Pandas, Polars, PyArrow, and custom DataFrame-like objects. The main components include abstract base classes for table management, specific implementations for different data types, and utility functions for determining the appropriate manager for a given data input. The directory also includes a protocol for DataFrame interchange, allowing for interoperability between different DataFrame implementations.

## What does it do?

The codebase facilitates the management and manipulation of tabular data across various formats. It provides a standardized way to interact with data tables, allowing users to perform operations such as formatting, sorting, selecting rows or columns, and exporting data to CSV or JSON formats. The system is designed to be flexible and extensible, supporting multiple data formats and libraries. It includes:

- **DataFrame Interchange Protocol**: Defines a standard interface for exchanging data between different DataFrame implementations, ensuring compatibility and ease of integration.
- **Table Managers**: Implementations for managing data in specific formats, such as Pandas, Polars, and PyArrow. These managers provide methods for data manipulation and export.
- **Utility Functions**: Functions to determine the appropriate table manager for a given data input, ensuring that the correct tools are used for the data type at hand.
- **Formatting Utilities**: Functions to apply formatting to table data, allowing for customized presentation of data values.

The system is designed to be robust and adaptable, capable of handling a wide range of data types and structures. It leverages external libraries like Pandas, Polars, and PyArrow for efficient data handling and conversion, while also providing a framework for custom DataFrame-like objects.

## Entry points

The main files in the directory are organized to provide a clear flow of data management and manipulation:

- **`dataframe_protocol.py`**: Defines the DataFrame interchange protocol, including abstract base classes and enumerations for device and data types.
- **`default_table.py`**: Implements a default table manager for handling JSON-compatible data formats, providing basic data manipulation and export functionalities.
- **`df_protocol_table.py`**: Manages data structures conforming to the DataFrame Interchange Protocol, leveraging PyArrow for efficient data handling.
- **`format.py`**: Provides utility functions for formatting table data based on a specified mapping.
- **`pandas_table.py`**: Defines a table manager for Pandas DataFrames, offering various data manipulation and export functionalities.
- **`polars_table.py`**: Implements a table manager for Polars DataFrames, supporting data export, formatting, filtering, and summarization.
- **`pyarrow_table.py`**: Manages data tables using PyArrow, providing methods for data conversion, formatting, selection, and summarization.
- **`table_manager.py`**: Defines abstract base classes for table management, providing a framework for converting data to different formats and performing operations on tabular data.
- **`types.py`**: Defines a protocol for objects that behave like dataframes, facilitating interoperability with different implementations.
- **`utils.py`**: Provides utility functions to obtain a suitable table manager for a given data input, checking for necessary dependencies and handling different data types.

## Key Files

- **`dataframe_protocol.py`**: Establishes the DataFrame interchange protocol, crucial for ensuring compatibility between different DataFrame implementations.
- **`default_table.py`**: Provides a baseline implementation for managing JSON-compatible data, serving as a fallback when no specific manager is available.
- **`df_protocol_table.py`**: Specializes in handling data conforming to the DataFrame Interchange Protocol, using PyArrow for efficient operations.
- **`pandas_table.py`**: Focuses on managing Pandas DataFrames, leveraging the extensive capabilities of the Pandas library.
- **`polars_table.py`**: Tailored for Polars DataFrames, offering high-performance data manipulation and export.
- **`pyarrow_table.py`**: Utilizes PyArrow for managing data tables, providing robust data conversion and querying capabilities.
- **`table_manager.py`**: Defines the abstract framework for table management, setting the foundation for all specific implementations.
- **`types.py`**: Ensures interoperability by defining a protocol for DataFrame-like objects.
- **`utils.py`**: Facilitates the selection of the appropriate table manager, ensuring that the system can handle a wide range of data types effectively.

## Dependencies

The directory relies on several external libraries to provide its functionalities:

- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and export in the `pandas_table.py` file.
- **Polars**: Utilized for handling and manipulating Polars DataFrames in the `polars_table.py` file.
- **PyArrow**: Employed for efficient data handling and conversion in the `pyarrow_table.py` and `df_protocol_table.py` files.
- **Standard Python Libraries**: Such as `enum`, `abc`, and `typing` for defining enumerations, abstract base classes, and type hints.

These dependencies are chosen for their robust data handling capabilities and compatibility with various data formats, ensuring that the system can efficiently manage and manipulate large datasets.
