title: "dataframe.py"

## High-level description

The target file, `dataframe.py`, defines utility types and constants for handling table data within the Marimo UI plugin framework. It primarily focuses on defining a flexible type alias, `TableData`, which can represent various forms of tabular data, including lists, dictionaries, and dataframes from popular libraries like Pandas, Polars, and PyArrow. This setup facilitates the integration and manipulation of different data structures within the Marimo UI components.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in this file is the `TableData` type alias, which is a union of several possible data structures that can be used to represent tabular data. It leverages other type aliases and type variables defined in the file, such as `ListOrTuple` and `JSONType`, to create a comprehensive and flexible data type.

## References

- `marimo._loggers`: Used to obtain a logger instance for logging purposes.
- `marimo._output.mime.MIME`: Included as a possible data type within the `TableData` union.
- `marimo._plugins.core.web_component.JSONType`: Used as a component of the `TableData` type alias.

## Symbols

### `TableData`
#### Description
`TableData` is a type alias that represents a flexible data structure for tabular data. It can accommodate various forms of data, including lists of JSON-compatible types, dictionaries, and dataframes from Pandas, Polars, and PyArrow.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a type alias, not a function or class with inputs).

#### Outputs
N/A (This is a type alias, not a function or class with outputs).

#### Internal Logic
`TableData` is defined as a union of several types:
- `List[JSONType]`: A list of JSON-compatible types.
- `ListOrTuple[Union[str, int, float, bool, MIME, None]]`: A list or tuple of basic data types or MIME objects.
- `ListOrTuple[Dict[str, JSONType]]`: A list or tuple of dictionaries with string keys and JSON-compatible values.
- `Dict[str, ListOrTuple[JSONType]]`: A dictionary with string keys and list or tuple values of JSON-compatible types.
- `"pd.DataFrame"`, `"pl.DataFrame"`, `"pa.Table"`: String annotations for Pandas, Polars, and PyArrow dataframes, respectively, to avoid direct imports unless type checking.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo._loggers` | Provides logging capabilities. |
| `marimo._output.mime.MIME` | Represents MIME types within the data structure. |
| `marimo._plugins.core.web_component.JSONType` | Defines JSON-compatible types used in the data structure. |

## Logging

The file uses the `marimo_logger` from the `marimo._loggers` module to potentially log messages, although no logging calls are explicitly present in the provided code snippet.

## TODOs

No TODOs or notes are present in the target file.
