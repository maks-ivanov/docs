## High-level description

The target file `ids.py` defines a mechanism for generating unique identifiers for UI elements within the Marimo framework. It includes an `IDProvider` class that generates IDs with a specified prefix, ensuring stability across sessions, and a custom exception `NoIDProviderException` for handling cases where an ID provider is not available.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are the `IDProvider` class and the `NoIDProviderException` class. The `IDProvider` class is responsible for generating unique IDs for UI elements, while the `NoIDProviderException` is used to signal the absence of an ID provider. The `IDProvider` class uses a prefix and a counter to generate unique IDs, ensuring that each ID is distinct and stable across sessions.

## Symbols

### `NoIDProviderException`
#### Description
`NoIDProviderException` is a custom exception class that is raised when an ID provider is not available. This exception is used to handle cases where an attempt is made to generate an ID without a valid ID provider.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

### `IDProvider`
#### Description
`IDProvider` is a class that provides unique identifiers for UI elements. It generates IDs using a specified prefix and a counter, ensuring that each ID is unique and stable across sessions. This is particularly useful in UI frameworks where elements need consistent identifiers for synchronization and state management.

#### Inputs
| Name   | Type | Description                        |
|:-------|:-----|:-----------------------------------|
| prefix | str  | A unique prefix for the generated IDs. |

#### Outputs
| Name   | Type | Description                        |
|:-------|:-----|:-----------------------------------|
| this_id | str  | A unique identifier for a UI element. |

#### Internal Logic
- **Initialization**: The constructor (`__init__`) initializes the ID provider with a given prefix and sets the counter to zero.
- **ID Generation**: The `take_id` method generates a new ID by concatenating the prefix with the current counter value, then increments the counter to ensure the next ID is unique.

## References

- The `IDProvider` class is referenced in other parts of the codebase, such as in `kernel_context.py` and `script_context.py`, where it is used to manage UI element IDs within different runtime contexts.
- The `NoIDProviderException` is used in the same files to handle cases where an ID provider is not available.

## Dependencies

The code uses the `__future__` module to ensure compatibility with future versions of Python, specifically for annotations.

## Error Handling

The `NoIDProviderException` is used to handle errors related to the absence of an ID provider. This exception is raised when an attempt is made to generate an ID without a valid provider, allowing the system to handle this situation gracefully.

## Side Effects

The `IDProvider` class maintains an internal counter that is incremented each time an ID is generated. This counter is part of the object's state and affects the IDs generated in subsequent calls to `take_id`.

## Performance Considerations

The `IDProvider` class is designed to efficiently generate unique IDs by maintaining a simple counter. This approach ensures that ID generation is fast and has minimal overhead, making it suitable for use in performance-sensitive applications.
