## High-level description

The `sidebar` class in the `marimo/_plugins/stateless/sidebar.py` file is a specialized layout component designed to display content in a sidebar format within a Marimo application. It extends the `Html` class and provides a way to organize content in a sidebar layout, ensuring that the content is displayed correctly when it is the last expression in a cell. The class supports adding content and an optional footer, and it ensures that the content is formatted as HTML for rendering.

## Code Structure

The `sidebar` class is the main symbol in this file, and it extends the `Html` class. It utilizes several functions and classes from the Marimo library, such as `md`, `as_html`, `vstack`, and `build_stateless_plugin`, to format and render the content. The class also overrides several methods from the `Html` class to raise exceptions, indicating that certain operations are not supported for the sidebar.

## Symbols

### `sidebar`
#### Description
The `sidebar` class is a layout component that displays content in a sidebar format. It is designed to be used as the last expression in a cell to ensure proper rendering. The class allows for the inclusion of content and an optional footer, both of which can be strings or lists, and it formats them using Markdown or vertical stacking as needed.

#### Inputs
| Name   | Type          | Description                        |
|:-------|:--------------|:-----------------------------------|
| item   | object        | The content to display in the sidebar. |
| footer | Optional[object] | The content to display at the bottom of the sidebar. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | Html | An `Html` object representing the sidebar content. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Initialization**: The constructor checks if the `item` is a string or a list and wraps it in Markdown or a vertical stack (`vstack`) respectively. If a `footer` is provided, it is similarly processed and appended to the `item` content.
2. **HTML Construction**: The processed content is converted to HTML using the `as_html` function and passed to the `build_stateless_plugin` function to create the sidebar component.
3. **Unsupported Methods**: The class overrides several methods (`batch`, `center`, `right`, `left`, `callout`, `style`) from the `Html` class to raise `TypeError`, indicating that these operations are not supported for the sidebar.

## References

- **`Html` Class**: The `sidebar` class extends the `Html` class, inheriting its properties and methods for rendering HTML content.
- **`md` Function**: Used to convert string content into Markdown-formatted HTML.
- **`vstack` Function**: Used to stack list items vertically in the sidebar.
- **`as_html` Function**: Converts content into an `Html` object for rendering.
- **`build_stateless_plugin` Function**: Constructs the HTML for the sidebar component.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo._output.md` | Provides the `md` function for Markdown conversion. |
| `marimo._output.formatting` | Provides the `as_html` function for HTML conversion. |
| `marimo._output.hypertext` | Provides the `Html` class for HTML rendering. |
| `marimo._plugins.core.web_component` | Provides the `build_stateless_plugin` function for building the sidebar component. |
| `marimo._plugins.stateless.flex` | Provides the `vstack` function for vertical stacking of items. |

## Error Handling

The `sidebar` class raises `TypeError` for unsupported methods (`batch`, `center`, `right`, `left`, `callout`, `style`), ensuring that users are aware of the limitations of the sidebar component.
