## High-level description

The `carousel` function in the `marimo/_plugins/stateless/carousel.py` file is designed to create a carousel component from a sequence of items. It takes a list of items, converts them into HTML format, and returns an `Html` object that represents a carousel component. This function is part of the Marimo library, which provides tools for creating interactive and dynamic web components.

## Code Structure

The main function in this file is `carousel`, which utilizes several helper functions and classes from other parts of the Marimo library to achieve its functionality. It references the `Html` class for HTML representation and uses the `build_stateless_plugin` function to construct the HTML for the carousel component.

## References

- `Html`: A class from `marimo._output.hypertext` used to encapsulate HTML content.
- `md`: A function from `marimo._output.md` used to convert markdown text to HTML.
- `as_html`: A function from `marimo._output.formatting` used to convert objects to HTML.
- `build_stateless_plugin`: A function from `marimo._plugins.core.web_component` used to build the HTML for stateless components.

## Symbols

### `carousel`
#### Description
The `carousel` function creates a carousel component from a sequence of items. It processes each item in the sequence, converting it to HTML, and then constructs a carousel component using the `build_stateless_plugin` function. The resulting HTML is encapsulated in an `Html` object.

#### Inputs
| Name  | Type         | Description          |
|:------|:-------------|:---------------------|
| items | Sequence[object] | A list of items to be included in the carousel. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Html | Html | An `Html` object representing the carousel component. |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function iterates over the `items` sequence.
2. For each item, it checks if the item is a string. If so, it converts it to HTML using the `md` function; otherwise, it uses the `as_html` function.
3. It concatenates the HTML representations of all items into a single string.
4. It calls `build_stateless_plugin` with the component name "marimo-carousel" and the concatenated HTML string to create the carousel component.
5. The resulting HTML string is wrapped in an `Html` object and returned.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo._output.formatting` | Provides the `as_html` function for converting objects to HTML. |
| `marimo._output.hypertext` | Provides the `Html` class for encapsulating HTML content. |
| `marimo._output.md` | Provides the `md` function for converting markdown to HTML. |
| `marimo._plugins.core.web_component` | Provides the `build_stateless_plugin` function for constructing HTML components. |

## Error Handling

The function does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the input items can be converted to HTML using the provided functions. If an item cannot be converted, it may result in an error during execution.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in this function.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
