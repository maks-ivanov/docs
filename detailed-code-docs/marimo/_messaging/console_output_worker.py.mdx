## High-level description

The `console_output_worker.py` file is responsible for managing and processing console output messages in a buffered manner. It defines a mechanism to collect console messages, buffer them, and then write them out in batches to a specified stream. This is done to optimize performance and ensure that console outputs are efficiently managed and transmitted to the frontend.

## Code Structure

The main components of this file include the `ConsoleMsg` data class, several helper functions for managing console output, and the `buffered_writer` function which orchestrates the buffering and writing of console messages. The `ConsoleMsg` class is used to encapsulate the details of a console message, while the helper functions manage the buffering logic and determine when and how messages should be merged or written out.

## Symbols

### `ConsoleMsg`
#### Description
`ConsoleMsg` is a data class that represents a console message. It encapsulates the details of a message, including the stream type, cell ID, data, and mimetype.

#### Inputs
| Name     | Type             | Description                        |
|:---------|:-----------------|:-----------------------------------|
| stream   | StreamT          | The type of stream (STDOUT, STDERR, etc.) |
| cell_id  | CellId_t         | The identifier of the cell associated with the message |
| data     | str              | The actual console output data     |
| mimetype | KnownMimeType    | The mimetype of the data           |

#### Outputs
None

### `_write_console_output`
#### Description
This function writes a console output message to a specified stream. It constructs a `CellOp` object with the console output details and broadcasts it to the stream.

#### Inputs
| Name       | Type       | Description                        |
|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------------------------------|
| stream     | Stream     | The stream to which the message is broadcasted |
| stream_type| StreamT    | The type of stream (STDOUT, STDERR, etc.) |
| cell_id    | CellId_t   | The identifier of the cell associated with the message |
| data       | str        | The actual console output data     |
| mimetype   | KnownMimeType | The mimetype of the data         |

#### Outputs
None

### `_can_merge_outputs`
#### Description
Determines if two `ConsoleMsg` objects can be merged. This is based on whether they have the same stream type and mimetype.

#### Inputs
| Name   | Type       | Description                        |
|:-------|:-----------|:-----------------------------------|
| first  | ConsoleMsg | The first console message          |
| second | ConsoleMsg | The second console message         |

#### Outputs
| Name   | Type  | Description                        |
|:-------|:------|:-----------------------------------|
| result | bool  | True if the messages can be merged, False otherwise |

### `_add_output_to_buffer`
#### Description
Adds a `ConsoleMsg` to a buffer, merging it with the last message if possible. This function manages the buffering of console messages for each cell.

#### Inputs
| Name                    | Type                      | Description                        |
|:------------------------|:--------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| console_output          | ConsoleMsg                | The console message to be added to the buffer |
| outputs_buffered_per_cell | dict[CellId_t, list[ConsoleMsg]] | The buffer storing messages per cell |

#### Outputs
None

### `buffered_writer`
#### Description
The `buffered_writer` function is responsible for managing the buffering and timed flushing of console messages. It uses a condition variable to synchronize access to the message queue and flushes buffered messages to the stream when the timer expires.

#### Inputs
| Name      | Type               | Description                        |
|:----------|:-------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| msg_queue | deque[ConsoleMsg]  | A queue of console messages to be processed |
| stream    | Stream             | The stream to which messages are written |
| cv        | Condition          | A condition variable for synchronizing access to the message queue |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- The function continuously waits for new messages or a timer expiration.
- It uses a condition variable to wait for messages to be added to the queue.
- Messages are buffered and merged if possible.
- When the timer expires, all buffered messages are flushed to the stream.

## References

- `CellId_t` from `marimo._ast.cell`: Used as the type for cell identifiers.
- `CellChannel` and `CellOutput` from `marimo._messaging.cell_output`: Used for defining the channel type and constructing console output messages.
- `KnownMimeType` from `marimo._messaging.mimetypes`: Used to specify the mimetype of console messages.
- `CellOp` from `marimo._messaging.ops`: Used to broadcast console output messages to the stream.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `time`     | Used for managing timeouts and delays in message processing. |
| `dataclasses` | Provides the `dataclass` decorator for defining simple data structures. |
| `typing`   | Provides type annotations for better code clarity and type checking. |

## Performance Considerations

The use of a deque and condition variable for message buffering and synchronization is chosen for performance reasons, as it was found to be faster than using a built-in queue. The function is designed to minimize the frequency of writes to the stream by batching messages, which can improve performance in high-throughput scenarios.
