## High-level description

The `marimo/_cli` directory is a comprehensive command-line interface (CLI) module for the Marimo application. It provides a suite of tools and commands to interact with Marimo notebooks, manage configurations, convert files, and perform development tasks. The directory is structured into several components, each responsible for different functionalities:

- **CLI Commands**: Defined using the `click` library, these commands allow users to create, edit, run, and export Marimo notebooks, as well as manage configurations and tutorials.
- **File Handling**: Utilities for validating file paths, handling GitHub URLs, and managing temporary files.
- **Configuration Management**: Tools for displaying and managing user configuration settings.
- **Conversion Tools**: Functions to convert Jupyter notebooks and Markdown files into Marimo-compatible formats.
- **Development Utilities**: Commands for generating OpenAPI schemas and managing Marimo processes.
- **Environment Information**: Functions to gather and display system environment details for debugging.
- **Version Management**: Tools to check for updates to the Marimo package on PyPI.
