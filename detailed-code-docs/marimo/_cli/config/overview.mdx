## High-level description

The `marimo/_cli/config` directory is part of the Marimo command-line interface (CLI) configuration module. It provides functionality for managing and displaying user configuration settings in a user-friendly manner. The main components within this directory include command definitions for interacting with the configuration and utility functions for formatting the output. The directory leverages the Click library to define CLI commands and uses TOML for configuration data serialization and deserialization.

## What does it do?

The code in this directory allows users to interact with their Marimo configuration through a command-line interface. Specifically, it provides a command to display the current configuration settings in a readable format. When a user runs the `show` command, the system retrieves the configuration data, formats it using TOML, and highlights the headers for better readability. This is particularly useful for users who need to review or verify their configuration settings in a structured and visually appealing manner.

## Entry points

The main entry point in this directory is the `commands.py` file, which defines the CLI commands related to configuration management. The `config` command group serves as a container for related commands, and the `show` command is the primary command for displaying the configuration.

## Key Files

- **`commands.py`**: This file defines the CLI commands for configuration management. It includes the `config` command group and the `show` command, which retrieves and displays the user's configuration.

- **`utils.py`**: This file provides utility functions for formatting TOML data. The main function, `highlight_toml_headers`, is used to apply color formatting to TOML headers, enhancing the readability of the configuration output.

## Dependencies

- **Click**: Used to define and manage the command-line interface. Click is a popular library for creating command-line applications in Python, chosen for its simplicity and flexibility.

- **tomlkit**: Utilized for serializing and deserializing TOML data. TOML is a configuration file format that is easy to read due to its clear syntax.

- **marimo._cli.print**: Provides functions for colored terminal output, such as `green` and `orange`, which are used to format text in the terminal.

- **marimo._config.manager**: Manages user configuration data, providing methods to retrieve and save configuration settings.

## Configuration

The configuration settings are managed by the `UserConfigManager` class, which is responsible for retrieving and saving user configuration data. The `show` command in `commands.py` uses this class to access the configuration and display it to the user. The configuration data is expected to be in TOML format, which is processed and highlighted for better readability.
