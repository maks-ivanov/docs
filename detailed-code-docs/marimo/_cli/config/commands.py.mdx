## High-level description

The target file, `commands.py`, is part of the Marimo CLI configuration module. It defines a command-line interface (CLI) group and a command for displaying the Marimo configuration. The `config` group serves as a container for related commands, and the `show` command specifically retrieves and displays the user's configuration in a formatted manner.

## Code Structure

- The `config` function is a Click command group that organizes related commands.
- The `show` function is a Click command that retrieves and displays the user's configuration using the `UserConfigManager` class.
- The `show` command is added to the `config` command group.

## References

- `UserConfigManager` from `marimo._config.manager`: Manages user configuration, providing methods to retrieve and save configuration data.
- `highlight_toml_headers` from `marimo._cli.config.utils`: Highlights TOML headers for better readability.
- `green` from `marimo._cli.print`: Formats text in green color for terminal output.

## Symbols

### `config`
#### Description
Defines a Click command group for Marimo configuration-related commands. It serves as a container for commands like `show`.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

### `show`
#### Description
Retrieves and displays the Marimo user configuration in a formatted manner. It uses the `UserConfigManager` to access the configuration and formats the output with color and structure for better readability.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
1. Instantiates `UserConfigManager` to manage user configuration.
2. Retrieves the configuration file path and prints it in green using the `green` function.
3. Converts the configuration data to a TOML string using `tomlkit.dumps`.
4. Highlights the TOML headers using `highlight_toml_headers`.
5. Outputs the formatted configuration to the terminal.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `click` | Provides the CLI framework for defining commands and groups. |
| `tomlkit` | Used to serialize and deserialize TOML data. |
| `marimo._cli.config.utils` | Provides utility functions for formatting TOML headers. |
| `marimo._cli.print` | Provides functions for colored terminal output. |
| `marimo._config.manager` | Manages user configuration data. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors within the `show` command. It relies on the underlying libraries and functions to manage exceptions, such as file access errors or TOML parsing issues.

## Logging

No explicit logging is implemented in this file. However, the `UserConfigManager` class used within the `show` command does include logging for configuration saving operations.

## TODOs

No TODOs or notes are present in the code.
