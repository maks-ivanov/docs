## High-level description

The target file, `marimo/_output/mime.py`, defines a protocol for handling MIME types within the Marimo application. It specifies a `MIME` protocol that requires implementing classes to define a `_mime_` method, which returns a tuple containing a MIME type and associated data. This protocol is intended for use with Marimo's media viewer, facilitating the rendering of various media types.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in the code is the `MIME` protocol, which is a dataclass that serves as a blueprint for classes that need to provide MIME type information. The protocol specifies that any implementing class must define the `_mime_` method. This method is expected to return a tuple consisting of a `KnownMimeType` and a string, which represents the data associated with that MIME type.

## References

- `KnownMimeType`: This is a type alias imported from `marimo._messaging.mimetypes`, which defines a set of literal MIME types that are recognized by the system.

## Symbols

### `MIME`
#### Description
The `MIME` protocol is a blueprint for classes that need to provide MIME type information for use in Marimo's media viewer. It requires implementing classes to define a `_mime_` method that returns a tuple of a MIME type and the corresponding data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | N/A  | The protocol itself does not take inputs directly. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | tuple[KnownMimeType, str] | A tuple containing a MIME type and the associated data. |

#### Internal Logic
The `MIME` protocol does not implement any internal logic itself. It serves as a contract that requires implementing classes to provide a specific method, `_mime_`, which must return a tuple of a `KnownMimeType` and a string.

## Side Effects
There are no side effects associated with the `MIME` protocol itself, as it is a protocol definition and does not execute any logic.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `dataclasses` | Used to define the `MIME` protocol as a dataclass. |
| `typing.Protocol` | Provides the `Protocol` base class for defining the `MIME` protocol. |
| `marimo._messaging.mimetypes.KnownMimeType` | Defines the set of recognized MIME types that can be used with the `MIME` protocol. |

## TODOs
- The code contains a TODO comment indicating a need for a single source of truth for supported MIME types, as the documented types are currently copied from the frontend. This suggests a potential improvement in maintaining consistency and reducing redundancy in MIME type definitions across the application.
