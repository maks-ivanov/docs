title: "__init__.py"
---

The target file `marimo/_output/md_extensions/__init__.py` is essentially an empty file, containing only a copyright notice. This file is part of a Python package, as indicated by its location in a directory structure that typically represents a package (`md_extensions`).

## High-level description
The purpose of this file is to serve as an initializer for the `md_extensions` package within the `marimo._output` module. In Python, the presence of an `__init__.py` file in a directory indicates that the directory should be treated as a package. This allows the package to be imported and used in other parts of the codebase.

## Code Structure
Since the file is empty except for the copyright notice, there are no symbols, functions, classes, or methods defined within it. Its primary role is to signal to Python that the directory is a package.

## References
There are no direct references to other parts of the codebase within this file, as it does not contain any executable code or imports.

## Symbols
There are no significant symbols defined in this file.

## Dependencies
There are no external libraries or modules used in this file.

## Configuration
There are no configuration options or settings defined in this file.

## Error Handling
There is no error handling implemented in this file.

## Logging
There is no logging mechanism implemented in this file.

## API/Interface Reference
This file does not define any API or public interface.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code. 

In summary, the `__init__.py` file in the `md_extensions` package is a placeholder to ensure the directory is recognized as a package by Python. It does not contain any functional code or configuration.
