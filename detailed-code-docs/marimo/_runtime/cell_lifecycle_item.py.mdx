## High-level description

The `cell_lifecycle_item.py` file defines an abstract base class `CellLifecycleItem` that represents a lifecycle item associated with a cell in a runtime environment. This class provides a framework for managing the creation and disposal of resources or state associated with a cell's lifecycle, ensuring that necessary setup and cleanup operations are performed at the beginning and end of a cell's execution.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in this file is the `CellLifecycleItem` class, which is an abstract base class. It defines two abstract methods, `create` and `dispose`, which must be implemented by any subclass. These methods are intended to be called at the start and end of a cell's lifecycle, respectively.

## Symbols

### `CellLifecycleItem`
#### Description
The `CellLifecycleItem` class is an abstract base class that defines a contract for managing the lifecycle of a cell in a runtime environment. It provides two abstract methods, `create` and `dispose`, which subclasses must implement to handle the setup and cleanup of resources or state associated with a cell.

#### Inputs
- `create` method:
  | Name    | Type            | Description                          |
  |:--------|:----------------|:-------------------------------------|
  | context | `RuntimeContext` | The runtime context in which the cell is executed. |

- `dispose` method:
  | Name    | Type            | Description                          |
  |:--------|:----------------|:-------------------------------------|
  | context | `RuntimeContext` | The runtime context in which the cell is executed. |
  | deletion| `bool`          | A flag indicating whether the cell is being removed from the graph. |

#### Outputs
- `create` method:
  | Name | Type | Description |
  |:-----|:-----|:------------|
  | None | None | The method does not return a value. |

- `dispose` method:
  | Name   | Type | Description |
  |:-------|:-----|:------------|
  | result | `bool` | Returns `True` if the disposal is successful and the lifecycle item should be removed from the registry, or `False` if the disposal needs to be retried in the next cell lifecycle. |

#### Internal Logic
- The `create` method is intended to be implemented by subclasses to perform any necessary setup or side-effects at the beginning of a cell's lifecycle.
- The `dispose` method is intended to be implemented by subclasses to perform cleanup operations at the end of a cell's lifecycle. The method should return `True` if the cleanup is successful, or `False` if it needs to be retried.

## References

- The `CellLifecycleItem` class references the `RuntimeContext` type from the `marimo._runtime.context.types` module, which provides the context in which the cell is executed.

## Dependencies

The file uses the `abc` module to define the abstract base class and methods, and the `typing` module for type annotations, specifically `TYPE_CHECKING` to avoid circular imports during runtime.

## Error Handling

The `dispose` method's return value provides a mechanism for handling errors or incomplete cleanup operations by allowing the method to be retried in the next cell lifecycle if necessary.
