The target file `marimo/_runtime/__init__.py` is an empty Python file that contains only a copyright notice. This file is part of a Python package, as indicated by its location within a directory structure and its naming convention (`__init__.py`).

## High-level description
The purpose of this file is to serve as an initializer for the `marimo._runtime` package. In Python, the presence of an `__init__.py` file in a directory indicates that the directory should be treated as a package. This file can be used to execute initialization code for the package or to define what is available when the package is imported.

The file is essentially a placeholder, and its primary role is to indicate that `marimo/_runtime` is a package. Future development might involve adding initialization code or package-level imports to this file.
