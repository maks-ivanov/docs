title: "scratch.py"

## High-level description

The target file `marimo/_runtime/scratch.py` defines a constant `SCRATCH_CELL_ID` which is used to identify a special type of cell, referred to as a "scratch" cell, within the Marimo runtime environment. This identifier is likely used to manage temporary or ad-hoc code execution that does not persist or affect the main execution graph of cells.

## Code Structure

The file is minimal and contains only a single constant definition. The `SCRATCH_CELL_ID` is defined as a constant of type `CellId_t`, which is a type alias for `str` as defined in the related file `marimo/_ast/cell.py`.

## References

- `CellId_t`: This is a type alias for `str` defined in `marimo/_ast/cell.py`. It is used to type the `SCRATCH_CELL_ID` constant.

## Symbols

### `SCRATCH_CELL_ID`
#### Description
`SCRATCH_CELL_ID` is a constant that holds a special identifier for scratch cells in the Marimo runtime. Scratch cells are likely used for temporary code execution that does not interfere with the main execution graph of cells.

#### Inputs
This symbol does not take any inputs as it is a constant definition.

#### Outputs
| Name            | Type     | Description                                      |
|:----------------|:---------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| SCRATCH_CELL_ID | CellId_t | A string identifier for scratch cells, set to `"__scratch__"` |

## Dependencies

The file imports `CellId_t` from `marimo._ast.cell`, which is a type alias for `str`. This import is used to type the `SCRATCH_CELL_ID` constant.

## Usage Context

The `SCRATCH_CELL_ID` is used in the Marimo runtime to identify and manage scratch cells. In the related file `marimo/_runtime/runtime.py`, this identifier is used in the `Kernel` class, specifically in the `run_scratchpad` method, to handle the execution of scratchpad code. This suggests that scratch cells are treated differently from regular cells, possibly allowing for quick, temporary code execution without affecting the main cell graph.

## Conclusion

The `SCRATCH_CELL_ID` serves as a unique identifier for scratch cells within the Marimo runtime, facilitating the management and execution of temporary code snippets. This allows users to execute code in an isolated manner, without impacting the main execution flow of the application.
