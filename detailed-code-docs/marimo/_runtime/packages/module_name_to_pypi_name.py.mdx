## High-level description

The target file `module_name_to_pypi_name.py` provides a function that returns a dictionary mapping Python module names to their corresponding package names on the Python Package Index (PyPI). This mapping is useful for developers who need to know the PyPI package name associated with a particular module name, which can differ from the module name used in code.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in this file is the function `module_name_to_pypi_name`, which is responsible for returning the dictionary containing the module-to-PyPI package mappings. There are no other symbols or complex interactions within this file.

## Symbols

### `module_name_to_pypi_name`
#### Description
The function `module_name_to_pypi_name` returns a dictionary that maps module names to their corresponding PyPI package names. This mapping is essential for resolving the correct package name when installing dependencies via PyPI, as the module name used in code may not always match the package name on PyPI.

#### Inputs
This function does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mapping | `dict[str, str]` | A dictionary where keys are module names and values are the corresponding PyPI package names. |

#### Internal Logic
The function simply returns a hardcoded dictionary that contains the mappings between module names and their PyPI package names. There is no complex logic or computation involved.

## References

The related file `module_name_to_conda_name.py` references the `module_name_to_pypi_name` function to create a similar mapping for Conda package names. It uses the PyPI mapping as a starting point and modifies it for known differences in Conda package names.

## Dependencies

This file does not have any external dependencies.

## Error Handling

There is no error handling implemented in this file, as the function simply returns a static dictionary.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in this file.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
