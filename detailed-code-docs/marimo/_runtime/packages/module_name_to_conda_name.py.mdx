title: "module_name_to_conda_name.py"

## High-level description

The target file `module_name_to_conda_name.py` provides a function that maps Python module names to their corresponding package names in the Conda package manager. It leverages an existing mapping from module names to PyPI package names and adjusts it for known discrepancies specific to Conda.

## Code Structure

The main function in this file, `module_name_to_conda_name`, relies on another function, `module_name_to_pypi_name`, from a related file to obtain an initial mapping of module names to PyPI package names. It then modifies this mapping to correct known differences between PyPI and Conda package names.

## References

- `module_name_to_pypi_name`: This function is imported from `marimo/_runtime/packages/module_name_to_pypi_name.py` and provides the initial mapping of module names to PyPI package names.

## Symbols

### `module_name_to_conda_name`
#### Description
The function `module_name_to_conda_name` generates a dictionary mapping Python module names to their corresponding Conda package names. It starts with a mapping from module names to PyPI package names and adjusts it for known discrepancies specific to Conda.

#### Inputs
This function does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name    | Type         | Description                                      |
|:--------|:-------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| mapping | `dict[str, str]` | A dictionary mapping module names to Conda package names. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Initial Mapping**: The function calls `module_name_to_pypi_name` to get a dictionary mapping module names to PyPI package names.
2. **Adjustments for Conda**: It modifies this mapping to account for known differences between PyPI and Conda. For example, it changes the mapping for the module `cv2` from `opencv-python` (PyPI) to `opencv` (Conda).
3. **Return**: The adjusted mapping is returned.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo._runtime.packages.module_name_to_pypi_name` | Provides the initial mapping of module names to PyPI package names. |

## Error Handling

The function does not include explicit error handling. It assumes that the `module_name_to_pypi_name` function will return a valid dictionary.

## Side Effects

There are no side effects from this function as it only returns a dictionary and does not modify any external state or resources.

## Performance Considerations

The function is efficient as it primarily involves dictionary operations, which are generally fast in Python. The performance is largely dependent on the size of the dictionary returned by `module_name_to_pypi_name`.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
