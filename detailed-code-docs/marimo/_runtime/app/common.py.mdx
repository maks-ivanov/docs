## High-level description

The target file `marimo/_runtime/app/common.py` defines type aliases and a tuple structure used for representing the output of a cell execution in the Marimo application framework. It provides a standardized way to encapsulate the outputs and definitions resulting from the execution of a cell, which is a fundamental unit of computation in the Marimo system.

## Code Structure

The file defines three main type aliases: `OutputsType`, `DefsType`, and `RunOutput`. These types are used to structure the data related to the execution of cells within the Marimo framework. The `OutputsType` and `DefsType` are dictionaries that map cell identifiers and definition names to their respective values, while `RunOutput` is a tuple that combines these two types.

## Symbols

### `OutputsType`
#### Description
`OutputsType` is a type alias for a dictionary that maps a `CellId_t` (a string identifier for a cell) to any value. This type is used to represent the outputs of a cell after it has been executed.

#### Inputs
- None directly, as this is a type alias.

#### Outputs
- None directly, as this is a type alias.

### `DefsType`
#### Description
`DefsType` is a type alias for a dictionary that maps a string (representing a definition name) to any value. This type is used to represent the definitions made by a cell during its execution.

#### Inputs
- None directly, as this is a type alias.

#### Outputs
- None directly, as this is a type alias.

### `RunOutput`
#### Description
`RunOutput` is a type alias for a tuple containing `OutputsType` and `DefsType`. It encapsulates both the outputs and the definitions resulting from the execution of a cell, providing a unified structure for handling execution results.

#### Inputs
- None directly, as this is a type alias.

#### Outputs
- None directly, as this is a type alias.

## References

- `CellId_t`: This is a type alias for a string defined in `marimo/_ast/cell.py`, representing the unique identifier for a cell.
- The `RunOutput` type is used in other parts of the codebase, such as in `marimo/_runtime/app/kernel_runner.py` and `marimo/_runtime/app/script_runner.py`, where it is returned as the result of running cells.

## Dependencies

The file imports the following modules and types:
- `Any`, `Dict`, `Tuple` from the `typing` module for type annotations.
- `CellId_t` from `marimo._ast.cell`, which is a type alias for a string used to identify cells.

## Conclusion

The `common.py` file in the Marimo framework provides essential type definitions that standardize how cell execution results are represented and handled. These types are crucial for ensuring consistent data structures across different components of the framework that deal with cell execution and its outputs.
