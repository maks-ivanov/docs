## High-level description

The code in `marimo/_data/models.py` defines data structures for representing data tables and their columns, as well as summaries of columns. These structures are used to model data tables, including their source, name, number of rows and columns, and the types of data they contain. The code also includes definitions for various data types and literals that can be used in these data structures.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are interconnected as follows:
- `DataTableColumn` is used within `DataTable` to represent individual columns of a data table.
- `ColumnSummary` provides a summary of a column's data, which can be used in conjunction with `DataTable` to provide insights into the data contained within a table.
- `DataType`, `ExternalDataType`, `NumericLiteral`, `TemporalLiteral`, and `NonNestedLiteral` are type definitions that are used to specify the types of data that can be represented in the columns and summaries.

## Symbols

### `DataTableColumn`
#### Description
Represents a column in a data table, including its name, data type, and external data type.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | The name of the column. |
| type | DataType | The data type of the column. |
| external_type | ExternalDataType | The external data type of the column, typically from a source library like pandas or numpy. |

#### Outputs
None

### `DataTable`
#### Description
Represents a data table, including its source, name, number of rows and columns, and the columns it contains.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| source_type | DataTableSource | The source type of the data table (e.g., "local" or "duckdb"). |
| source | str | The source of the data table. |
| name | str | The name of the data table. |
| num_rows | Optional[int] | The number of rows in the data table. |
| num_columns | Optional[int] | The number of columns in the data table. |
| variable_name | Optional[str] | The variable name associated with the data table. |
| columns | List[DataTableColumn] | The list of columns in the data table. |

#### Outputs
None

### `ColumnSummary`
#### Description
Represents a summary of a column in a data table, including statistics like total count, number of nulls, unique values, and various statistical measures.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| total | Optional[int] | The total number of entries in the column. |
| nulls | Optional[int] | The number of null entries in the column. |
| unique | Optional[int] | The number of unique entries in the column. |
| min | Optional[NonNestedLiteral] | The minimum value in the column. |
| max | Optional[NonNestedLiteral] | The maximum value in the column. |
| mean | Optional[NonNestedLiteral] | The mean value of the column. |
| median | Optional[NonNestedLiteral] | The median value of the column. |
| std | Optional[NonNestedLiteral] | The standard deviation of the column. |
| true | Optional[int] | The count of true values in a boolean column. |
| false | Optional[int] | The count of false values in a boolean column. |
| p5 | Optional[NonNestedLiteral] | The 5th percentile value of the column. |
| p25 | Optional[NonNestedLiteral] | The 25th percentile value of the column. |
| p75 | Optional[NonNestedLiteral] | The 75th percentile value of the column. |
| p95 | Optional[NonNestedLiteral] | The 95th percentile value of the column. |

#### Outputs
None

## References

- The `DataType` and `ExternalDataType` are used to define the types of data that can be represented in `DataTableColumn`.
- `NonNestedLiteral` is used in `ColumnSummary` to represent various statistical measures.

## Dependencies

The code uses standard Python libraries such as `dataclasses`, `datetime`, `decimal`, and `typing` for defining data structures and types. These libraries are used to provide type annotations and to define the data structures in a concise and readable manner.
