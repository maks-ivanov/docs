The target file `marimo/_config/__init__.py` is currently empty except for a copyright notice. This suggests that it is intended to be a part of a Python package, specifically the `marimo._config` module. The presence of the `__init__.py` file indicates that this directory is meant to be treated as a package by Python, allowing for the inclusion of other modules within the `marimo._config` namespace.

## High-level description
The file is intended to serve as an initializer for the `marimo._config` package, which is likely part of a larger project named Marimo. Its current state suggests that it may be a placeholder for future configuration-related code or logic that will be added to this package.
