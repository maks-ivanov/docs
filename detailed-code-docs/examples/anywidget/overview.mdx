## High-level description

The `examples/anywidget` directory contains example scripts that demonstrate the use of the `marimo` framework to create interactive applications with custom widgets. The two main scripts, `reactive_quak.py` and `tldraw_colorpicker.py`, showcase different functionalities and integrations with external libraries for data visualization and user interaction. The `reactive_quak.py` script focuses on reactive data visualization using a custom widget and Altair charts, while the `tldraw_colorpicker.py` script demonstrates interactive color selection and scatter plot visualization using a color picker widget and Matplotlib.

## What does it do?

The directory provides examples of how to build interactive applications using the `marimo` framework. These applications are designed to be dynamic, meaning they can update their user interface in response to changes in data or user input.

- **Reactive Quak Application (`reactive_quak.py`)**: This application reads a dataset of athletes from a remote Parquet file, processes the data using the `polars` library, and visualizes it using a custom widget from the `quak` library and an Altair chart. The application is structured using `marimo`'s reactive programming model, which allows for dynamic updates to the UI based on data changes. Users can interact with the data through the custom widget, and the visualization updates accordingly.

- **Tldraw Color Picker Application (`tldraw_colorpicker.py`)**: This application creates an interactive color picker using the `tldraw` library and visualizes a scatter plot using `matplotlib`. Users can select colors dynamically, which are then applied to the scatter plot points. The application demonstrates how to integrate a color picker widget into a `marimo` application and use it to influence the appearance of a data visualization.

## Entry points

The main files in the directory are `reactive_quak.py` and `tldraw_colorpicker.py`. Each script serves as an entry point for its respective application, showcasing different aspects of building interactive applications with `marimo`.

- **`reactive_quak.py`**: This script is organized around the `marimo.App` class, with several cells defined using the `@app.cell` decorator. The cells handle tasks such as data loading, widget creation, data selection, and visualization. The data flow involves reading a dataset, processing it, and visualizing it with a custom widget and Altair chart.

- **`tldraw_colorpicker.py`**: This script also uses the `marimo.App` framework, with cells defined to handle data generation, widget creation, and plot rendering. The data flow involves generating random data for a scatter plot and using a color picker widget to dynamically update the plot's appearance.

## Dependencies

Both scripts rely on several external libraries to provide their functionality:

- **`marimo`**: Used to create and manage the interactive applications and UI components.
- **`polars`** (in `reactive_quak.py`): Used for efficient data manipulation and processing.
- **`quak`** (in `reactive_quak.py`): Provides a custom widget for displaying data.
- **`altair`** (in `reactive_quak.py`): Used for creating interactive data visualizations.
- **`matplotlib`** (in `tldraw_colorpicker.py`): Used for plotting the scatter plot.
- **`numpy`** (in `tldraw_colorpicker.py`): Used for generating random data.
- **`tldraw`** (in `tldraw_colorpicker.py`): Provides the `ReactiveColorPicker` widget for color selection.
