title: "package.json"
---

## High-level description
This `package.json` file defines the configuration and dependencies for a Node.js project. It appears to be a simple web application that likely uses WebSockets and may involve AI-related functionality, given the presence of the `@gptscript-ai/gptscript` dependency.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @gptscript-ai/gptscript | AI-related functionality, possibly for text generation or processing |
| express | Web application framework for Node.js |
| express-ws | WebSocket module for Express |
| nodemon | Development tool for automatically restarting the server on file changes |
| ws | WebSocket client and server implementation for Node.js |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| name | string | "examples" | The name of the project |
| version | string | "1.0.0" | The current version of the project |
| description | string | "" | An empty description field |
| main | string | "index.js" | The entry point of the application |
| license | string | "ISC" | The license under which the project is distributed |

### Scripts
| Script | Command | Description |
|:-------|:--------|:------------|
| dev | "nodemon server.js" | Runs the server using nodemon for development |
| test | "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1" | A placeholder test script that exits with an error |

## Notes
1. The project is set up for development with `nodemon`, allowing for automatic server restarts when files change.
2. There are no test scripts implemented yet, as indicated by the placeholder test command.
3. The main file is set to `index.js`, but the development script runs `server.js`. This discrepancy might need to be addressed.
4. The project appears to be in its initial stages (version 1.0.0) and lacks a description, keywords, and author information.
5. The inclusion of WebSocket-related dependencies (`express-ws` and `ws`) suggests that the application likely implements real-time communication features.
