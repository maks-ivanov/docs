## High-level description

The directory contains a collection of scripts designed to demonstrate various applications of the `pymde` library for creating and visualizing embeddings. These scripts utilize the `marimo` framework to create interactive applications or notebooks, allowing users to explore different aspects of embeddings through user interfaces. The main components include scripts for visualizing complete graphs, debugging embeddings, drawing graphs, embedding numbers, analyzing Google Scholar networks, performing interactive cluster analysis, demonstrating rotational invariance, visualizing binary trees, and embedding US counties.

## What does it do?

The scripts in this directory provide interactive demonstrations of embedding techniques using the `pymde` library. Each script focuses on a specific use case or dataset, such as the MNIST dataset, Google Scholar co-authorship networks, or US county demographic data. Users can interact with the applications to adjust parameters, visualize results, and gain insights into the embedding processes. The `marimo` framework facilitates the creation of user interfaces, allowing users to manipulate inputs like the number of nodes, penalty functions, or embedding dimensions, and observe the effects on the generated embeddings.

## Entry points

The directory contains multiple scripts, each serving as an entry point for a specific demonstration:

- **`complete_graph.py`**: Visualizes complete graphs with user-selected parameters.
- **`debugging_embeddings.py`**: Guides users through sanity-checking embeddings using the MNIST dataset.
- **`drawing_graphs.py`**: Allows users to visualize and manipulate graph embeddings.
- **`embedding_numbers.py`**: Demonstrates embeddings of the MNIST dataset with adjustable parameters.
- **`google_scholar.py`**: Embeds and visualizes a co-authorship network from Google Scholar.
- **`interactive_cluster_analysis.py`**: Performs cluster analysis on the MNIST dataset with interactive visualizations.
- **`rotational_invariance.py`**: Demonstrates rotational invariance in embeddings.
- **`tree.py`**: Visualizes binary trees with adjustable sizes.
- **`us_counties.py`**: Embeds and visualizes US county demographic data.

## Dependencies

The scripts rely on several external libraries:

- **`marimo`**: Used for creating interactive applications and managing UI components.
- **`pymde`**: Utilized for generating and manipulating embeddings.
- **`matplotlib.pyplot`**: Employed for plotting and visualizing data.
- **`torch`**: Used for tensor operations and checking CUDA availability.
- **`altair`**: Used for creating interactive visualizations.
- **`pandas`**: Utilized for data manipulation and creating DataFrames.
- **`numpy`** and **`scipy.sparse`**: Used for numerical operations and sparse matrix handling.

These dependencies enable the scripts to perform complex embedding computations and provide interactive visualizations, enhancing the user's ability to explore and understand the data.
