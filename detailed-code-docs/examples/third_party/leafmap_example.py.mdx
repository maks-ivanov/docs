## High-level description

The target file `leafmap_example.py` is a script that demonstrates the integration of the `leafmap` library with the `marimo` framework. It sets up a simple application using `marimo` to display a map with various basemaps and a tile layer using `leafmap`. The script is designed to be run as a standalone application.

## Code Structure

The script is structured around the `marimo` framework, which uses a decorator-based approach to define application cells. Each cell is a function decorated with `@app.cell`, which allows it to be part of the `marimo` application. The script imports necessary libraries, defines cells for markdown content and map creation, and finally runs the application.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which serves as the main application object for the `marimo` framework. It is used to define and run the application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a cell within the `marimo` application. Each cell can perform specific tasks, such as rendering markdown or creating a map.

### `__()`
#### Description
This is a placeholder function name used multiple times in the script. Each instance of `__()` serves a different purpose based on its content.

#### Inputs and Outputs
- The first `__()` function takes `mo` (an alias for `marimo`) as input and outputs markdown content using `mo.md()`.
- The second `__()` function takes `leafmap` as input and outputs a `leafmap.Map` object with added basemaps and a tile layer.
- The third `__()` function imports `marimo` and `leafmap` and returns them for use in other cells.

#### Internal Logic
- The first cell uses `mo.md()` to render markdown instructions for installing `leafmap` and `marimo`.
- The second cell creates a `leafmap.Map` object centered on specific coordinates, adds basemaps, and a Google Satellite tile layer.
- The third cell imports necessary libraries and returns them for use in other cells.

### `if __name__ == "__main__":`
#### Description
This conditional statement checks if the script is being run as the main program and, if so, calls `app.run()` to start the `marimo` application.

## References

- `marimo`: The main framework used to create and run the application.
- `leafmap`: A library used to create and manipulate maps.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Used to create and manage the application framework. |
| `leafmap`  | Used to create and manipulate maps within the application. |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the necessary libraries are installed and that the map creation process will succeed without issues.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose any API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone application.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
