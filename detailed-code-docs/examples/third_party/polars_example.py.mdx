## High-level description

The target file, `polars_example.py`, is a script that demonstrates the use of the `Polars` library within a `marimo` application. It showcases how to load a CSV file into a Polars DataFrame, filter the data based on user input through dropdowns, and visualize the filtered data using Altair charts. The script is structured as a series of `marimo` cells, each performing a specific task in the data processing and visualization pipeline.

## Code Structure

The script is organized into several `marimo` cells, each defined by the `@app.cell` decorator. These cells are executed in sequence and are responsible for different parts of the data processing and visualization workflow. The main components include:

- Importing necessary libraries and setting up the application.
- Loading data from a CSV file into a Polars DataFrame.
- Creating UI elements for filtering data.
- Filtering the data based on user input.
- Visualizing the filtered data using Altair.
- Displaying the data in a table format.

## Symbols

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell in the `marimo` application. Each cell represents a unit of work, such as importing libraries, processing data, or rendering UI components.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | Module | The `marimo` module, used for UI components and application logic. |
| pl | Module | The `polars` module, used for data manipulation. |
| alt | Module | The `altair` module, used for data visualization. |
| df | DataFrame | The Polars DataFrame containing the loaded data. |
| type_1_filter | UI Component | Dropdown for filtering by "Type 1". |
| type_2_filter | UI Component | Dropdown for filtering by "Type 2". |
| filtered | DataFrame | The filtered Polars DataFrame. |
| table | UI Component | The table UI component displaying data. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| alt | Module | The `altair` module, returned for use in other cells. |
| mo | Module | The `marimo` module, returned for use in other cells. |
| np | Module | The `numpy` module, returned for use in other cells. |
| pl | Module | The `polars` module, returned for use in other cells. |
| df | DataFrame | The Polars DataFrame containing the loaded data. |
| type_1_filter | UI Component | Dropdown for filtering by "Type 1". |
| type_2_filter | UI Component | Dropdown for filtering by "Type 2". |
| values_1 | List | List of unique values from "Type 1". |
| values_2 | List | List of unique values from "Type 2". |
| filtered | DataFrame | The filtered Polars DataFrame. |
| table | UI Component | The table UI component displaying data. |

#### Internal Logic
- **Data Loading**: A CSV file is loaded into a Polars DataFrame using `pl.read_csv`.
- **UI Creation**: Dropdowns are created for filtering data based on unique values in specific columns.
- **Data Filtering**: The DataFrame is filtered based on the selected values from the dropdowns.
- **Data Visualization**: An Altair chart is created to visualize the filtered data.
- **Data Display**: The filtered data is displayed in a table format using `marimo` UI components.

## References

- **Polars**: Used for data manipulation and filtering.
- **Altair**: Used for creating visualizations.
- **Marimo**: Provides the application framework and UI components.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Provides the application framework and UI components. |
| polars | Used for efficient data manipulation and filtering. |
| numpy | Used for numerical operations, though not explicitly utilized in the script. |
| altair | Used for creating interactive visualizations. |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the data loading, filtering, and visualization operations will succeed without issues. In a production environment, it would be advisable to add error handling to manage potential issues such as network errors when loading data or invalid user inputs.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms. Adding logging could be beneficial for debugging and monitoring the application's behavior, especially in a more complex or production setting.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code. The script appears to be complete and functional for its intended demonstration purpose.
