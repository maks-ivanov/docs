## High-level description

The `mermaid.py` file is a script that utilizes the `marimo` library to create an interactive application for rendering and editing Mermaid diagrams. It defines a series of cells that set up a Mermaid graph, provide a code editor for Mermaid syntax, and render the resulting diagram using Markdown. The application is designed to run as a standalone script, allowing users to interact with Mermaid diagrams through a graphical interface.

## Code Structure

The code is structured around the `marimo.App` class, which is used to define an application with multiple cells. Each cell is a function decorated with `@app.cell`, and these functions are executed in sequence to build the application's functionality. The main symbols in the code are the `marimo` library, the `App` instance, and the cell functions that define the application's behavior.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object. It is used to define and run the application by registering cell functions that contribute to the application's functionality.

### Cell Functions
Each cell function is decorated with `@app.cell` and contributes to the application's functionality. The functions are executed in the order they are defined.

#### First Cell Function
##### Description
This cell imports the `marimo` library as `mo` and returns it. It sets up the environment for subsequent cells to use the `marimo` library.

##### Inputs
None

##### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The `marimo` module imported as `mo`. |

#### Second Cell Function
##### Description
This cell uses the `mo.mermaid` function to render a predefined Mermaid graph. The graph is centered in the output.

##### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The `marimo` module imported as `mo`. |

##### Outputs
None

##### Internal Logic
- Calls `mo.mermaid` with a string defining a Mermaid graph.
- Centers the rendered graph using the `center()` method.

#### Third Cell Function
##### Description
This cell creates a code editor for editing Mermaid syntax using `mo.ui.code_editor`. It initializes the editor with a sequence diagram and returns the editor object.

##### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The `marimo` module imported as `mo`. |

##### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| graph | object | The code editor object for Mermaid syntax. |

##### Internal Logic
- Calls `mo.ui.code_editor` with initial Mermaid sequence diagram code.
- Sets the language to "mermaid" and provides a label "Mermaid editor".

#### Fourth Cell Function
##### Description
This cell renders the Mermaid diagram from the code editor using `mo.md` and `mo.mermaid`. It displays the rendered diagram in Markdown format.

##### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| graph | object | The code editor object containing Mermaid syntax. |
| mo | module | The `marimo` module imported as `mo`. |

##### Outputs
None

##### Internal Logic
- Uses `mo.md` to render Markdown text.
- Embeds the Mermaid diagram using `mo.mermaid` with the current value from the code editor.

## Side Effects

- The script modifies the application's state by defining and executing cell functions.
- It interacts with the `marimo` library to render and display Mermaid diagrams.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Provides the framework for building interactive applications and rendering Mermaid diagrams. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors. It relies on the `marimo` library to manage any exceptions that may occur during the execution of cell functions.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is designed to be run as a standalone application.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
