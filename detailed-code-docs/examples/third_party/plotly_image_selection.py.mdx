## High-level description

The target file, `plotly_image_selection.py`, is a script that demonstrates the use of the `marimo` library to create interactive Plotly visualizations with image selection capabilities. It showcases how to integrate Plotly figures with Marimo's UI components to enable user interactions, such as selecting ranges on images and overlaying traces on images.

## Code Structure

The script is structured using the `marimo` library's `App` and `cell` decorators to define interactive components. It imports necessary libraries like `plotly.graph_objects`, `plotly.express`, and `skimage.io` to handle image processing and visualization. The script is divided into several cells, each responsible for a specific part of the visualization process, such as loading images, creating figures, and displaying interactive plots.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which serves as the main application object for managing the interactive components and running the application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a cell in the Marimo application. Each cell represents a unit of computation or UI component that can be executed independently.

### `__()`
#### Description
Multiple functions are defined with the name `__`, each decorated with `@app.cell`. These functions are responsible for different tasks such as importing libraries, displaying markdown text, creating and updating Plotly figures, and managing UI components.

#### Inputs and Outputs
- Inputs and outputs vary for each function, typically involving Marimo UI components and Plotly figures.

#### Internal Logic
- The functions use Plotly to create figures and Marimo to wrap these figures into interactive components. They also handle image loading and display markdown text for documentation purposes.

## References

- The script references the `marimo` library for creating interactive applications and UI components.
- It uses `plotly.graph_objects` and `plotly.express` for creating and manipulating visualizations.
- The `skimage.io` module is used for reading images from URLs.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Used for creating interactive applications and UI components. |
| `plotly` | Used for creating interactive visualizations. |
| `scikit-image` | Used for image processing tasks, specifically reading images. |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that all operations, such as image loading and figure creation, will succeed. In a production environment, it would be advisable to add error handling for network requests and data processing steps.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms. Adding logging could be beneficial for debugging and monitoring the application's behavior.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone script to demonstrate the capabilities of Marimo and Plotly for interactive visualizations.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
