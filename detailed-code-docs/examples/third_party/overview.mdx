## High-level description

The `examples/third_party` directory contains a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate the integration of various third-party libraries with the `marimo` framework. Each script is designed to showcase specific functionalities, such as data exploration, map visualization, diagram rendering, and interactive plotting. The main components within this directory include:

- `duckdb_example.py`: Demonstrates dataset exploration and SQL querying using DuckDB.
- `leafmap_example.py`: Integrates `leafmap` for map visualization.
- `mapbox.py`: Uses Plotly's Mapbox for interactive map visualizations.
- `mermaid.py`: Renders and edits Mermaid diagrams.
- `plotly_image_selection.py`: Creates interactive Plotly visualizations with image selection.
- `polars_example.py`: Utilizes the `Polars` library for data manipulation and visualization.

## What does it do?

The scripts in this directory provide interactive applications that leverage the `marimo` framework to create user-friendly interfaces for various data processing and visualization tasks. Here's a brief overview of what each script does:

- **`duckdb_example.py`**: Allows users to search and explore datasets from Hugging Face, apply filters, and execute SQL queries on dataset files using DuckDB. It provides a user interface for dataset selection and SQL querying.

- **`leafmap_example.py`**: Sets up a simple application to display a map with various basemaps and a tile layer using `leafmap`. Users can interact with the map and switch between different views.

- **`mapbox.py`**: Demonstrates how to create a scatter plot on a street map using Plotly's Mapbox. Users can toggle between different map styles, such as street and satellite views, and visualize data about US cities.

- **`mermaid.py`**: Provides an interactive application for rendering and editing Mermaid diagrams. Users can input Mermaid syntax in a code editor and see the resulting diagram rendered in real-time.

- **`plotly_image_selection.py`**: Showcases interactive Plotly visualizations with image selection capabilities. Users can select ranges on images and overlay traces, enhancing the interactivity of image-based data visualizations.

- **`polars_example.py`**: Demonstrates loading a CSV file into a Polars DataFrame, filtering data based on user input, and visualizing the filtered data using Altair charts. It provides dropdowns for filtering and displays the data in a table format.

## Entry points

The main files in this directory are the individual scripts themselves, each serving as an entry point for its respective demonstration. The code is organized conceptually around the `marimo` framework, which uses a decorator-based approach to define interactive cells. Each script imports necessary libraries, defines cells for specific tasks, and runs the application using `marimo.App`.

## Dependencies

The scripts in this directory rely on several external libraries and frameworks, including:

- **`marimo`**: Used across all scripts for creating interactive applications and UI components.
- **`duckdb`**: Utilized in `duckdb_example.py` for executing SQL queries on dataset files.
- **`pandas`**: Used in `duckdb_example.py` for data manipulation.
- **`requests`**: Used in `duckdb_example.py` for making HTTP requests to the Hugging Face API.
- **`leafmap`**: Used in `leafmap_example.py` for map visualization.
- **`plotly`**: Used in `mapbox.py` and `plotly_image_selection.py` for creating interactive plots and maps.
- **`scikit-image`**: Used in `plotly_image_selection.py` for image processing tasks.
- **`polars`**: Used in `polars_example.py` for efficient data manipulation.
- **`altair`**: Used in `polars_example.py` for creating interactive visualizations.

These dependencies were chosen for their specific capabilities in data processing, visualization, and creating interactive user interfaces.
