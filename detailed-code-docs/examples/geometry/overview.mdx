## High-level description

The `examples/geometry` directory contains scripts that utilize the `marimo` library to create interactive applications for visualizing mathematical concepts. Specifically, it includes applications for exploring the Mandelbrot set and various 3D surfaces. These scripts provide user interfaces that allow users to interactively adjust parameters and visualize the results using `matplotlib` for plotting.

## What does it do?

The scripts in this directory are designed to help users explore complex mathematical concepts through interactive visualizations:

1. **Mandelbrot Set Visualization (`mandelbrot.py`)**:
   - This script allows users to explore the fractal nature of the Mandelbrot set. Users can adjust parameters such as the number of iterations, zoom level, and panning offsets to see how these changes affect the visualization of the Mandelbrot set. The application provides a graphical plot that updates in real-time as users modify the controls.

2. **3D Surface Visualization (`surfaces.py`)**:
   - This script provides an interactive application for visualizing different 3D surfaces, such as a paraboloid, saddle, sphere, and torus. Users can select a surface type and adjust parameters to see how these changes affect the shape of the surface. The application uses a 3D plot to display the selected surface, allowing users to explore the geometric properties of each surface type.

Both applications leverage the `marimo` library to create a user-friendly interface with controls for parameter adjustment, and they use `matplotlib` for rendering the visualizations.

## Entry points

The main files in this directory are `mandelbrot.py` and `surfaces.py`. Each file serves as an entry point for its respective application:

- **`mandelbrot.py`**: This file is the entry point for the Mandelbrot set visualization application. It initializes the `marimo` application, sets up the user interface, and defines the logic for computing and plotting the Mandelbrot set.

- **`surfaces.py`**: This file is the entry point for the 3D surface visualization application. It initializes the `marimo` application, sets up the user interface, and defines the logic for generating and plotting various 3D surfaces.

In both scripts, the `marimo` library is used to organize the code into interactive components, with each component defined by a function decorated with `@app.cell`. These components include UI elements, computational logic, and plotting functions. The data flow involves user inputs being processed by the application to update the visualizations in real-time.
