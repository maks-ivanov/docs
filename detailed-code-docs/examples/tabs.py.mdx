## High-level description

The target file `examples/tabs.py` is a Python script that uses the `marimo` library to create a simple web application with a tabbed interface. The application allows users to input and organize data related to a user and an organization. It demonstrates the use of `marimo`'s UI components, such as text inputs and tabs, to create an interactive user interface.

## Code Structure

The script is structured around the `marimo` library's `App` class and its `@app.cell` decorator, which is used to define individual cells or components of the application. Each cell is a function that contributes to the application's UI or logic. The script defines several cells to create markdown content, input fields, and a tabbed interface, and to display a welcome message based on user input.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object. It is used to define and run the web application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a cell in the `marimo` application. Each cell represents a component or a piece of logic in the application.

### `__(mo)`
#### Description
This cell function uses the `mo` (marimo) object to add a markdown header "Tabs" to the application.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | object | The marimo object used to interact with the UI components. |

#### Outputs
None

### `__(mo)`
#### Description
This cell function adds a markdown description about using `mo.ui.tabs` to organize outputs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | object | The marimo object used to interact with the UI components. |

#### Outputs
None

### `__(mo)`
#### Description
This cell function creates two vertical stacks of UI components: one for editing user information and another for editing organization information. It then organizes these stacks into tabs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | object | The marimo object used to interact with the UI components. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| employees | object | A UI component for inputting the number of employees. |
| first | object | A UI component for inputting the first name. |
| last | object | A UI component for inputting the last name. |
| org | object | A UI component for inputting the organization name. |
| organization | object | A vertical stack of organization-related UI components. |
| settings | object | A vertical stack of user-related UI components. |

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a vertical stack `settings` for user information with text inputs for "First Name" and "Last Name".
- Creates a vertical stack `organization` for organization information with text input for "Organization Name" and a number input for "Number of Employees".
- Uses `mo.ui.tabs` to create a tabbed interface with "User" and "Organization" tabs.

### `__(employees, first, last, mo, org)`
#### Description
This cell function generates a welcome message using the input values from the user and organization fields.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| employees | object | The UI component for the number of employees. |
| first | object | The UI component for the first name. |
| last | object | The UI component for the last name. |
| mo | object | The marimo object used to interact with the UI components. |
| org | object | The UI component for the organization name. |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Constructs a welcome message using the values from the `first`, `last`, and `org` inputs.
- Displays the message if all input fields have values.
- Uses a dynamic number of celebration emojis based on the employee number.

### `__()`
#### Description
This cell function imports the `marimo` library as `mo` and returns it.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | module | The imported marimo module. |

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Used to create and manage the web application's UI components. |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that all inputs are valid and that the `marimo` library functions as expected.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface beyond the UI components created with `marimo`.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
