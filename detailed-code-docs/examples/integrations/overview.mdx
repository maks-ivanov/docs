## High-level description

The `examples/integrations` directory contains example scripts that demonstrate how to integrate with various Google Cloud services using the `marimo` framework. Each script provides a user interface for interacting with a specific Google Cloud service, such as BigQuery, Cloud Storage, or Google Sheets. The scripts are structured using `marimo`'s reactive notebook framework, which organizes functionality into cells that are executed in response to user inputs or other cell outputs.

## What does it do?

The scripts in this directory provide interactive applications for accessing and manipulating data in Google Cloud services:

1. **Google Cloud BigQuery**: This script allows users to authenticate with Google Cloud, select datasets and tables, and preview data from a selected table. It provides a user interface for configuring credentials, selecting datasets and tables, and displaying data in a table format.

2. **Google Cloud Storage**: This script enables users to browse Google Cloud Storage buckets and their contents. Users can authenticate with Google Cloud, select a storage bucket, filter files by prefix, and display file details in a table format. The application also allows users to view the content of selected files, handling different content types such as images and text.

3. **Google Sheets**: This script demonstrates how to authenticate with Google Sheets and read data from a Google Sheet. Users can input a Google Sheets URL, and the application retrieves and displays the spreadsheet data in a table format. Authentication is handled using either Application Default Credentials or a Service Account Key File.

## Entry points

The main files in this directory are:

- `google_cloud_bigquery.py`: Demonstrates integration with Google Cloud BigQuery.
- `google_cloud_storage.py`: Demonstrates integration with Google Cloud Storage.
- `google_sheets.py`: Demonstrates integration with Google Sheets.

Each script is organized into `marimo` cells, which are functions decorated with `@app.cell`. These cells are executed in sequence to build a user interface for interacting with the respective Google Cloud service. The data flow involves user inputs for authentication and selection, followed by data retrieval and display.

## Dependencies

The scripts in this directory rely on several external libraries:

- **`marimo`**: Used to create the application and UI components. It provides the framework for building interactive applications with reactive cells.
- **`google-cloud-bigquery`**: Provides the client library for interacting with Google Cloud BigQuery.
- **`google-cloud-storage`**: Provides the client for interacting with Google Cloud Storage.
- **`gspread`**: A library for accessing Google Sheets.
- **`oauth2client`**: Used for handling OAuth2 authentication.
- **`pandas`**: Used for data manipulation and display.

These dependencies are chosen to facilitate interaction with Google Cloud services and to provide a user-friendly interface for data manipulation and display.
