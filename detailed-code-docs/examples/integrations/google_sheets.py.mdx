## High-level description

The target file `google_sheets.py` is an example integration using the `marimo` framework to interact with Google Sheets. It demonstrates how to authenticate with Google Sheets using either Application Default Credentials or a Service Account Key File, and how to read data from a Google Sheet and display it in a table format using the `marimo` UI components.

## Code Structure

The code is structured using the `marimo` framework, which organizes functionality into cells. Each cell is a function decorated with `@app.cell`, and these cells are executed in sequence when the application runs. The main components include setting up Google Sheets authentication, obtaining a spreadsheet URL, and displaying the spreadsheet data.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which is used to define and run the application. It is configured with a full-width layout.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell in the `marimo` application. Each cell represents a unit of functionality that can be executed independently.

### `__()`
#### Description
This is a placeholder function name used for multiple cells. Each cell performs a specific task, such as importing libraries, configuring UI elements, or handling Google Sheets authentication and data retrieval.

#### Inputs and Outputs
The inputs and outputs vary for each cell, depending on its specific functionality. For example, some cells take user input via UI components, while others return credentials or data objects.

#### Internal Logic
- **Import Libraries**: The first cell imports necessary libraries like `gspread`, `pandas`, and `oauth2client`.
- **Display Markdown**: Another cell uses `mo.md` to display markdown content, such as instructions for installing dependencies.
- **UI Configuration**: A cell sets up a text input for the credentials file path and displays configuration instructions using an accordion UI component.
- **Google Sheets Authentication**: A cell handles authentication by setting up credentials using either a service account key file or application default credentials.
- **Spreadsheet URL Input**: A cell provides a text area for the user to input the Google Sheets URL.
- **Data Retrieval and Display**: The final cell retrieves data from the specified Google Sheet and displays it in a table using `pandas` and `marimo` UI components.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Framework for building interactive applications. |
| `gspread` | Library for accessing Google Sheets. |
| `oauth2client` | Library for handling OAuth2 authentication. |
| `pandas` | Used for data manipulation and display. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors beyond basic checks, such as verifying if a spreadsheet URL is provided. Authentication errors or issues with accessing Google Sheets are not specifically managed within the code.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The code does not expose an API but provides a user interface through `marimo` for interacting with Google Sheets.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
