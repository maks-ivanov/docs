## High-level description

The code in `examples/task_list.py` is a simple task list application built using the `marimo` framework. It defines a series of cells that create a user interface for adding, displaying, and managing tasks. The application allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and clear completed tasks.

## Code Structure

The code is structured using the `marimo` framework, which organizes functionality into "cells". Each cell is a function decorated with `@app.cell`, and these cells collectively define the behavior and UI of the application. The main components include task management logic, UI elements for task input and display, and state management for tasks.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which serves as the main application object. It is used to define and run the application.

### `Task`
#### Description
`Task` is a data class representing a task with a name and a completion status.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | The name of the task. |
| done | bool | Indicates whether the task is completed. Defaults to `False`. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Task | Task | A new task instance. |

### `get_tasks`, `set_tasks`, `mutation_signal`, `set_mutation_signal`
#### Description
These are state management functions provided by `marimo` to manage the list of tasks and a mutation signal.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| get_tasks | function | Retrieves the current list of tasks. |
| set_tasks | function | Updates the list of tasks. |
| mutation_signal | bool | A signal indicating a change in the task list. |
| set_mutation_signal | function | Updates the mutation signal. |

### `task_entry_box`
#### Description
A UI element for entering new tasks, created using `marimo.ui.text`.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| task_entry_box | UI element | A text input box for entering task names. |

### `add_task`, `add_task_button`, `clear_tasks_button`
#### Description
Functions and UI elements for adding tasks and clearing completed tasks.

#### Internal Logic
- `add_task`: Adds a new task to the list if the entry box is not empty and sets the mutation signal.
- `add_task_button`: A button that triggers the `add_task` function.
- `clear_tasks_button`: A button that removes completed tasks from the list.

### `task_list`
#### Description
A UI element displaying the list of tasks with checkboxes to mark them as completed.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| task_list | UI element | An array of checkboxes representing tasks. |

### `mo`
#### Description
`mo` is an alias for the `marimo` module, used within cells to access UI and state management functions.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Provides the framework for building the application, including UI components and state management. |
| dataclasses | Used to define the `Task` data class. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors beyond basic function definitions and state management. It relies on the `marimo` framework to manage UI interactions and state updates.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The code does not expose an API or public interface beyond the UI elements defined within the application.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
