## High-level description

The `examples/personal_finance` directory contains Python scripts designed to provide interactive financial tools using the `marimo` library. These tools include a compound interest simulator and a mortgage calculator. Both applications leverage the `marimo` framework to create interactive notebooks that allow users to input financial parameters and visualize the results through dynamic plots and calculations.

## What does it do?

The directory offers two main financial tools:

1. **Compound Interest Simulator**: This tool allows users to simulate the growth of an investment portfolio over time. Users can adjust parameters such as the initial investment amount, monthly contributions, expected annual return, investment duration, and capital gains tax rate. The tool then calculates the growth of the investment, taking into account the compounding effect, and visualizes the results using plots. This helps users understand how their investments might grow over time under different scenarios.

2. **Mortgage Calculator**: This application helps users estimate their mortgage payments and related financials when considering purchasing a home. Users input their income, home purchase details, and monthly expenses. The calculator then computes the mortgage payments, potential tax liabilities, and savings. It guides users through the process with interactive steps, providing a comprehensive view of their financial situation related to home buying.

Both tools are designed to be user-friendly, with interactive elements that make it easy for users to experiment with different financial scenarios and immediately see the results.

## Entry points

The directory contains two main scripts that serve as entry points for their respective applications:

- `compound_interest.py`: This script is the entry point for the compound interest simulation tool. It organizes the simulation process into interactive cells using the `marimo` library, allowing users to input parameters and visualize the investment growth.

- `mortgage_calculator.py`: This script is the entry point for the mortgage calculator application. It structures the mortgage calculation process into a series of interactive steps, guiding users through inputting their financial details and understanding their mortgage-related financials.

## Key Files

- **`compound_interest.py`**: Contains the logic for simulating compound interest growth. It includes a `Portfolio` class for modeling investment growth and a `simulate` function for calculating and plotting the investment's progress over time.

- **`mortgage_calculator.py`**: Implements the mortgage calculator functionality. It includes functions for calculating federal taxes and creating mortgage loans, using the `mortgage` module for detailed financial calculations.

## Dependencies

Both scripts rely on several external libraries:

- **`marimo`**: Used to create interactive notebook environments with UI components and markdown rendering. It allows the applications to be modular and user-friendly.

- **`matplotlib.pyplot`**: Utilized for plotting graphs and visualizing financial data, such as investment growth and mortgage payments.

- **`mortgage`**: Specifically used in the mortgage calculator for handling mortgage-related calculations, such as creating loans and determining monthly payments.

- **`numpy`**: Employed in the mortgage calculator for numerical operations, particularly in handling arrays of interest and principal payments.

These dependencies are chosen to facilitate interactive user experiences and accurate financial calculations, making the tools both informative and engaging for users.
