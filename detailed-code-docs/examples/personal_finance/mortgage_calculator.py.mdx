## High-level description

The `mortgage_calculator.py` file is a personal finance application built using the Marimo framework. It provides a comprehensive mortgage calculator that allows users to input their income, home purchase details, and monthly expenses to calculate their mortgage payments, tax liabilities, and potential savings. The application is structured as a series of interactive cells that guide the user through the process of estimating their financial situation related to home buying.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into multiple `@app.cell` functions, each representing a step in the mortgage calculation process. These cells are executed in sequence to gather user inputs, perform calculations, and display results. The main symbols in the code include:

- `app`: An instance of `marimo.App`, which manages the execution of the application.
- `mo`: A reference to the Marimo module, used for UI components and markdown rendering.
- `calculate_federal_tax`: A nested function within a cell that calculates federal tax based on income brackets.
- Various UI components: Created using `mo.ui.number` for user inputs and `mo.md` for displaying markdown content.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
An instance of the `marimo.App` class, which serves as the main application object managing the execution of the mortgage calculator.

### `mo`
#### Description
A reference to the Marimo module, used extensively throughout the code to create UI components and render markdown content.

### `calculate_federal_tax`
#### Description
Calculates the federal tax based on the provided taxable income using predefined tax brackets.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| income | float | The taxable income for which the federal tax is to be calculated. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tax | float | The calculated federal tax based on the income. |

#### Internal Logic
The function iterates over a list of tax brackets, calculating the tax for each bracket until the income is fully taxed. It uses a loop to apply the tax rate to the portion of income within each bracket.

### `loan`
#### Description
Represents a mortgage loan, created using the `mortgage.Loan` class, which calculates the monthly payment based on the principal, interest rate, and term.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| principal | float | The principal amount of the loan. |
| interest | float | The annual interest rate of the loan. |
| term | int | The term of the loan in years. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| loan | Loan | An instance of the `mortgage.Loan` class representing the mortgage loan. |

## References

- `numpy`: Used for numerical operations, particularly in handling arrays of interest and principal payments.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Provides the framework for building interactive applications with UI components and markdown rendering. |
| `mortgage` | Used for mortgage-related calculations, such as creating loans and calculating payments. |
| `numpy` | Utilized for numerical operations, particularly in handling arrays of interest and principal payments. |
| `matplotlib.pyplot` | Used for plotting graphs of cumulative and monthly mortgage payments. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors beyond basic exception raising. It assumes valid user inputs and does not include validation or error messages for incorrect inputs.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms. It primarily focuses on user interaction and calculation display.

## API/Interface Reference

The application does not expose an external API. It is designed as an interactive user interface using the Marimo framework, where users input data and receive calculated results directly within the application.

## TODOs

There are no explicit TODOs or notes left in the code. The application appears to be complete in its current form, providing a full workflow for calculating mortgage-related financials.
