## High-level description

The target file `examples/layout.py` is a Python script that uses the `marimo` library to create a reactive notebook application. The script demonstrates how to use horizontal and vertical stacking (`hstack` and `vstack`) to layout UI elements and outputs in a structured manner. It includes interactive UI components such as dropdowns, sliders, and checkboxes to manipulate the layout parameters dynamically.

## Code Structure

The script is structured as a series of `@app.cell` decorated functions, which define individual cells in a `marimo` notebook. Each cell can contain UI elements, markdown content, or logic to manipulate and display data. The cells are executed in a reactive manner, meaning changes in UI elements automatically trigger updates in dependent cells.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which represents the notebook application. It is used to define and manage the reactive cells within the notebook.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell in the `marimo` notebook. Each decorated function represents a cell that can contain UI elements, markdown, or other logic.

### `__()`
#### Description
The `__()` functions are anonymous functions (using the placeholder name `__`) that define the content and behavior of each cell. They utilize the `mo` object to interact with the `marimo` UI and markdown capabilities.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | object | The `marimo` object used to create UI elements and markdown content. |
| align | object | UI element for alignment options. |
| justify | object | UI element for justification options. |
| gap | object | UI element for setting the gap between elements. |
| size | object | UI element for setting the size of elements. |
| wrap | object | UI element for enabling or disabling wrapping. |
| boxes | list | List of HTML elements representing boxes. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| align | object | The selected alignment option. |
| gap | object | The selected gap value. |
| justify | object | The selected justification option. |
| size | object | The selected size value. |
| wrap | object | The selected wrap option. |
| boxes | list | List of created box elements. |
| create_box | function | Function to create a box element. |

#### Internal Logic
- The script defines several UI elements using `mo.ui` methods, such as dropdowns, sliders, and checkboxes.
- It uses `mo.md` to render markdown content within the cells.
- The `hstack` and `vstack` methods are used to layout elements horizontally and vertically, respectively.
- A helper function `create_box` is defined to generate HTML box elements with dynamic sizes.

## Side Effects
- The script modifies the UI state by creating interactive elements that affect the layout and appearance of the notebook.
- It dynamically updates the layout based on user interactions with the UI elements.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Used to create and manage the reactive notebook application, including UI elements and markdown rendering. |

## Error Handling
The script does not explicitly handle errors. It relies on the `marimo` library to manage UI interactions and updates.

## Logging
The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone `marimo` notebook application.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
