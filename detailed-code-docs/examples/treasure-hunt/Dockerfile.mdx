title: "Dockerfile"
---

## High-level description
This Dockerfile defines the environment and configuration for a Python Flask application, specifically for a treasure hunt game. It sets up a lightweight Python 3.9 container, installs dependencies, copies the application code, and configures the Flask server to run the app.

## Code Structure
The Dockerfile follows a typical structure for building a Python application container:
1. Base image selection
2. Working directory setup
3. Dependency installation
4. Application code copying
5. Port exposure
6. Environment variable configuration
7. Command to run the application

## Symbols

### FROM python:3.9-slim
#### Description
Specifies the base image for the Docker container, using the official Python 3.9 slim version.

### WORKDIR /app
#### Description
Sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`.

### COPY requirements.txt .
#### Description
Copies the `requirements.txt` file from the host to the current directory in the container.

### RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
#### Description
Installs Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` without caching the downloaded packages.

### COPY . .
#### Description
Copies all files from the current directory on the host to the working directory in the container.

### EXPOSE 5000
#### Description
Informs Docker that the container will listen on port 5000 at runtime.

### ENV FLASK_APP=app.py
#### Description
Sets the environment variable `FLASK_APP` to `app.py`, specifying the main application file for Flask.

### ENV FLASK_DEBUG=False
#### Description
Sets the `FLASK_DEBUG` environment variable to `False`, disabling Flask's debug mode.

### CMD ["flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0"]
#### Description
Specifies the command to run when the container starts, launching the Flask application and binding it to all network interfaces.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Python 3.9 | Runtime environment for the application |
| Flask | Web framework for the application (inferred from the use of `flask` command) |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| FLASK_DEBUG | Boolean | False | Enables/disables Flask debug mode |

## Notes
- The Dockerfile is designed for a production-like environment, with debugging disabled by default.
- The application is set to listen on all network interfaces (`0.0.0.0`), making it accessible from outside the container.
- Dependencies are installed from a `requirements.txt` file, which should be present in the same directory as the Dockerfile.
- The main application file is expected to be named `app.py`.
