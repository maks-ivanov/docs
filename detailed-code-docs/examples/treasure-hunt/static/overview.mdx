## High-level description
This directory contains static assets for a treasure hunt web application. It includes CSS for styling and JavaScript for implementing the game's functionality using Vue.js. The assets are designed to create an interactive and visually appealing user interface for the treasure hunt game.

## What does it do?
The static assets in this directory work together to create the frontend of a treasure hunt game. The CSS file (style.css) defines the visual appearance of the application, ensuring a clean and modern design. The JavaScript file (app.js) implements the game's logic using Vue.js, handling user input, communicating with the server to retrieve clues, and displaying the results. Together, these files create an interactive web application where users can input locations and receive clues in a formatted, easy-to-read manner.

## Key Files

### css/style.css
This file defines the styling for the entire application. It sets up the overall layout, typography, and visual appearance of various elements. Key features include:
- Using 'Roboto' sans-serif font for text
- Creating a centered layout with a maximum width for content
- Styling for input fields, buttons, and content boxes
- Specific styling for markdown-rendered content
- Styling for the GPT logo

### js/app.js
This file contains the core functionality of the treasure hunt game implemented as a Vue.js application. Key features include:
- Creating a Vue application instance to manage the game's state and user interactions
- Implementing a `getClues` method that sends user input to the server and handles the response
- Configuring the Marked library for parsing and rendering Markdown content
- Error handling for server communication
- Integration with Axios for HTTP requests and highlight.js for code syntax highlighting

## Dependencies
1. Vue.js (version not specified): Used as the frontend framework for building the user interface
2. Axios (version not specified): Used as the HTTP client for making requests to the server
3. Marked (version not specified): Used for parsing and rendering Markdown content
4. highlight.js (version not specified): Used for syntax highlighting in code blocks
5. Roboto font: Used as the primary font for the application

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, the JavaScript file (app.js) includes some configurable options:

1. Marked library configuration:
   - Enables GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)
   - Enables smart lists
   - Sets up custom rendering for code blocks with syntax highlighting

2. Vue application configuration:
   - Mounts the application to the element with id 'app'
   - Sets up reactive data properties for managing game state

These static assets are designed to work in conjunction with a server-side application that handles the `/get-clues` endpoint. The server is expected to receive POST requests with a `code` parameter containing the user's input and respond with Markdown-formatted clues.
