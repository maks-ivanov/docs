title: "package.json"

## High-level description
This `package.json` file defines the dependencies for a project named "treasure-hunt". It specifies a single dependency, the "marked" package, which is a popular Markdown parser and compiler for JavaScript.

## Symbols

### Dependencies
#### Description
The `dependencies` object in this `package.json` file lists the external packages required for the project to function properly.

#### Internal Logic
The file uses npm's semantic versioning syntax to specify the version of the "marked" package. The `^` symbol before the version number indicates that npm should install the latest minor or patch version within the 12.x.x range.

| Dependency | Version | Description |
|:-----------|:--------|:------------|
| marked | ^12.0.1 | A flexible markdown parser and compiler for JavaScript |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marked | Used for parsing and compiling Markdown content in the project |

## Configuration
This `package.json` file serves as a configuration file for npm (Node Package Manager). It defines the project's dependencies, which npm will use to install the required packages when running `npm install`.

## Notes
1. The project name "treasure-hunt" is inferred from the file path, as it's not explicitly stated in the provided JSON content.
2. The file only contains the `dependencies` field, suggesting it might be a partial `package.json` file or a minimal configuration for a simple project.
3. No other metadata such as version, description, or scripts are present in this file, which is unusual for a complete `package.json` file.
