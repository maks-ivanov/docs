title: "Dockerfile"
---

## High-level description
This Dockerfile creates a lightweight Alpine-based container for running the car-notifier application. It sets up the necessary environment, installs required dependencies, and configures the container to execute the car-notifier.gpt script using the GPTScript runtime.

## Symbols

### FROM
#### Description
Specifies the base image for the Docker container.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| alpine:latest | string | The latest version of the Alpine Linux base image |

### COPY
#### Description
Copies the car-notifier.gpt script from the host machine into the Docker container.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| car-notifier.gpt | file | The GPTScript file for the car-notifier application |
| ./ | string | The destination directory in the container (root directory) |

### RUN
#### Description
Executes commands to set up the container environment. It updates the package manager, installs necessary dependencies, downloads and installs GPTScript, and sets up a writable cache directory.

#### Internal Logic
1. Updates the package manager index
2. Installs curl and PostgreSQL client version 16
3. Downloads and runs the GPTScript installation script
4. Creates a .cache directory in the root and sets its permissions to be writable

### CMD
#### Description
Specifies the command to run when the container starts.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| gptscript | string | The GPTScript runtime command |
| --cache=false | string | A flag to disable caching |
| car-notifier.gpt | string | The GPTScript file to execute |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| alpine:latest | Base operating system for the container |
| curl | Used for downloading the GPTScript installer |
| postgresql16-client | PostgreSQL client for database interactions |
| GPTScript | Runtime for executing the car-notifier.gpt script |

## Performance Considerations
The use of Alpine Linux as the base image ensures a small container size, which can lead to faster deployments and reduced resource usage. The `--no-cache` option in the `apk add` command helps keep the image size smaller by not storing the package cache.
