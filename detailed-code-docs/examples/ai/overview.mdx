## High-level description

The `examples/ai` directory contains a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate the use of the `marimo` framework to build interactive applications. These applications leverage various AI capabilities, such as data labeling, text and image generation, PDF content querying, and media processing. Each script is structured using `marimo`'s cell-based architecture, which organizes the application into discrete, reusable components. The main components across these scripts include user interface elements, state management, and integration with external APIs like OpenAI and Substrate.

## What does it do?

The scripts in this directory provide interactive applications for different AI-driven tasks:

1. **Data Labeling (`data_labeler.py`)**: This application allows users to label a set of examples as "Real" or "AI Generated" and add notes to each example. It provides navigation controls to move through the examples and saves the labels and notes to a JSON file.

2. **Superhero Name Generator (`openai.py`)**: Users can input an animal name, and the application generates superhero names using OpenAI's GPT-4 model. It also allows users to generate a catchphrase and create an image representing the superhero using OpenAI's image generation capabilities.

3. **PDF Question Answering (`question-pdf.py`)**: This web application lets users upload a PDF document and ask questions about its content. It processes the PDF by splitting it into text chunks, embedding these chunks, and performing a similarity search to find relevant sections in response to user queries. The relevant text is used to generate a response using a GPT model.

4. **Media Content Generation (`substrate-run.py`)**: This application interacts with the Substrate API to generate and process media content. Users can input an API key, generate an image based on a prompt, upscale the image, and create a video using stable video diffusion techniques.

## Entry points

The directory contains multiple scripts, each serving as an entry point for a specific application:

- **`data_labeler.py`**: Entry point for the data labeling application.
- **`openai.py`**: Entry point for the superhero name generator application.
- **`question-pdf.py`**: Entry point for the PDF question answering application.
- **`substrate-run.py`**: Entry point for the media content generation application.

Each script is self-contained and can be run independently to start the respective application.

## Dependencies

The scripts in this directory rely on several external libraries and frameworks:

- **`marimo`**: Used across all scripts to build interactive applications with a cell-based approach.
- **`openai`**: Utilized in `openai.py` and `question-pdf.py` for interacting with OpenAI's API to generate text and images.
- **`json` and `os`**: Used in `data_labeler.py` for reading and writing JSON files and checking file existence.
- **`PyPDF2`**: Used in `question-pdf.py` for reading PDF files.
- **`langchain`**: Used in `question-pdf.py` for text processing and embeddings.
- **`substrate`**: Used in `substrate-run.py` for interacting with the Substrate API for media generation and processing.

These dependencies are chosen to provide robust functionality for building interactive applications and integrating with AI services.
