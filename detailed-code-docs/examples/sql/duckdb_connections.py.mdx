## High-level description

The `duckdb_connections.py` file is a script that uses the `marimo` library to create a web-based interface for interacting with a DuckDB database. It allows users to input a database URL, connect to a PostgreSQL database via DuckDB, and perform various operations such as listing tables, querying data, and exploring metadata functions. The script is structured using `marimo`'s cell-based approach, which organizes the code into discrete, interactive components.

## Code Structure

The script is organized into several `@app.cell` functions, each representing a distinct interactive component or step in the process of connecting to and interacting with a DuckDB database. These cells are executed in sequence, and they make use of the `marimo` library to create UI elements and handle database operations. The main symbols in the code are the `@app.cell` functions, which are used to define the logic for each step of the application.

## Symbols

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a cell in the `marimo` application. Each cell represents a distinct part of the application, such as importing modules, creating UI elements, or executing SQL queries.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Various | Varies | Each cell can have different inputs depending on its purpose, such as modules, UI elements, or database connections. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Various | Varies | Each cell can produce different outputs, such as UI elements, database connections, or query results. |

#### Internal Logic
Each cell contains specific logic related to its purpose. For example, some cells import necessary modules, others create UI elements like text inputs or dropdowns, and others execute SQL queries using DuckDB.

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which serves as the main application object. It is used to define and run the interactive web application.

### `mo`
#### Description
`mo` is an alias for the `marimo` module, used within the cells to access `marimo`'s functionality, such as creating UI elements and executing SQL queries.

### `duckdb`
#### Description
`duckdb` is a module imported within a cell to interact with DuckDB, a database management system. It is used to execute SQL commands and manage database connections.

## References

- The script references the `marimo` library extensively to create UI elements and manage application state.
- The `duckdb` module is used for database operations, specifically to connect to a PostgreSQL database and execute SQL queries.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Used to create the web-based interface and manage application state. |
| `duckdb` | Used to interact with the DuckDB database and execute SQL queries. |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors beyond basic exception raising. It assumes that the provided database URL is valid and that the DuckDB operations will succeed.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms. It focuses on creating an interactive interface without logging operations or errors.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API but provides a web-based interface for interacting with a DuckDB database. The interface includes elements like text inputs for the database URL, dropdowns for selecting functions, and sliders for setting query limits.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code. The script appears to be complete and functional for its intended purpose.
