## High-level description

The `examples/sql` directory contains a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate the use of the `marimo` library to create interactive web applications for data exploration and visualization. These scripts focus on different datasets and database systems, including DuckDB, SQLite, and CSV files, to showcase various functionalities such as querying, filtering, and visualizing data. The main components of this directory are individual scripts, each structured using `marimo`'s cell-based approach to define interactive components and workflows.

## What does it do?

The scripts in this directory provide interactive web-based interfaces for exploring and visualizing data from different sources:

1. **DuckDB Connections**: This script allows users to connect to a PostgreSQL database via DuckDB, input a database URL, and perform operations like listing tables and querying data. It uses `marimo` to create a user-friendly interface with interactive components.

2. **Electric Vehicles**: This application visualizes data on electric vehicles registered in Washington State. Users can filter the data by model year, city, and make, and view the results in bar charts. The script uses the Altair library for data visualization.

3. **SQL Cars**: This script provides an interactive data exploration tool for a dataset of cars. Users can filter and visualize car data using SQL queries executed via DuckDB. The application includes UI components like dropdowns and sliders, and uses Altair for visualizing trends and comparisons.

4. **SQLite**: This script demonstrates how to interact with an SQLite database using `marimo`. It includes examples of attaching a database, executing SQL queries, and displaying results. The script also features functionality to download a sample SQLite database if not present.

Each script is designed to be run as a standalone application, leveraging `marimo` to manage the application state and user interactions.

## Entry points

The directory contains multiple scripts, each serving as an entry point for a specific use case:

- **`duckdb_connections.py`**: Start here to explore how to connect to and interact with a DuckDB database using a web interface.
- **`electric_vehicles.py`**: Use this script to visualize and filter electric vehicle data from Washington State.
- **`sql_cars.py`**: This script is ideal for exploring and visualizing car data with interactive filtering options.
- **`sqlite.py`**: Begin with this script to learn how to interact with an SQLite database and execute SQL queries using `marimo`.

Each script is self-contained and demonstrates a specific aspect of data interaction and visualization using the `marimo` framework.
