## High-level description

The target file `examples/sql/sqlite.py` is a script that demonstrates how to use the `marimo` library to interact with an SQLite database. It provides examples of attaching a database, executing SQL queries, and displaying results using `marimo`'s capabilities. The script also includes functionality to download a sample SQLite database if it is not already present.

## Code Structure

The script is structured around the `marimo` library, which is used to create an application (`app`) with interactive cells. Each cell is defined using the `@app.cell` decorator, and these cells perform specific tasks such as displaying markdown content, executing SQL queries, and downloading a sample database. The script is designed to be run as a standalone application using `app.run()`.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which is used to create and manage the interactive application. It is configured with a medium width.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define interactive cells within the `marimo` application. Each cell can contain code that performs specific tasks, such as displaying markdown, executing SQL queries, or downloading files.

### `__generated_with`
#### Description
This variable indicates the version of the tool or library used to generate the script, which is "0.7.18" in this case.

### `__(mo)`
#### Description
This is a placeholder function name used for multiple cells. Each instance of this function performs different tasks depending on the context of the cell.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mo | object | An instance of the `marimo` library used to execute SQL and display markdown. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| _df | DataFrame | The result of the SQL query execution, though it is not explicitly returned or used. |

#### Internal Logic
- The first cell displays markdown content explaining the use of SQLite with `marimo`.
- The second cell executes SQL commands to detach and attach a SQLite database and queries the table names.
- The third cell displays markdown content explaining the next SQL query.
- The fourth cell executes a SQL query to calculate the average track length for each composer in the database.
- The fifth cell contains logic to download a sample SQLite database if it is not already present.

### `download_sample_data`
#### Description
A function defined within a cell to download the Chinook SQLite database from a specified URL if it does not already exist locally.

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if the database file exists locally.
- If not, it downloads the file from a given URL and saves it locally.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Used to create and manage the interactive application and execute SQL queries. |
| os | Used to check for the existence of the database file. |
| requests | Used to download the sample SQLite database from a URL. |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors. Potential errors such as network issues during the download or SQL execution errors are not managed within the script.

## Logging

The script includes print statements to inform the user about the download status of the database, indicating whether it is being downloaded or a cached version is being used.

## TODOs

There are no explicit TODOs or notes left in the code.
