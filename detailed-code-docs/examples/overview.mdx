## High-level description

The `examples` directory is a comprehensive collection of Python scripts and notebooks designed to demonstrate the capabilities of the `marimo` framework in building interactive applications. These examples cover a wide range of functionalities, including AI-driven applications, data visualization, financial tools, optimization techniques, and integrations with third-party libraries and services. Each subdirectory or script within this directory serves as a standalone demonstration of specific features or use cases, leveraging `marimo`'s cell-based architecture to create modular and reactive user interfaces.

## What does it do?

The `examples` directory provides a variety of interactive applications and demonstrations, each focusing on different aspects of data processing, visualization, and user interaction:

1. **AI Applications**: Scripts like `data_labeler.py` and `openai.py` showcase AI-driven tasks such as data labeling and text/image generation using OpenAI's API.

2. **Data Visualization**: Examples like `reactive_plots.py` and `pokemon_stats.py` demonstrate how to create interactive plots and dashboards using libraries like Altair and Seaborn.

3. **Financial Tools**: Applications such as `compound_interest.py` and `mortgage_calculator.py` provide interactive simulations for financial calculations, helping users understand investment growth and mortgage payments.

4. **Optimization Techniques**: Scripts like `regularization_and_sparsity.py` and `smallest_enclosing_circle.py` illustrate optimization problems and solutions, offering interactive interfaces for exploring these concepts.

5. **Third-party Integrations**: Examples like `duckdb_example.py` and `leafmap_example.py` demonstrate how to integrate with external libraries and services, such as DuckDB for SQL querying and Leafmap for map visualization.

6. **Interactive Notebooks**: The directory includes several scripts that create interactive notebooks, such as `bayes_theorem.py` for visualizing Bayes' Theorem and `sine_wave.py` for plotting sine waves with adjustable parameters.

Each script or subdirectory is designed to be self-contained, allowing users to explore specific functionalities or use cases independently. The `marimo` framework is used throughout to manage application state, user interactions, and UI components, providing a consistent and user-friendly experience across all examples.
