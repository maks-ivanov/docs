## High-level description
The "examples" directory contains a collection of diverse projects and applications that demonstrate various use cases and implementations of GPTScript, a tool for AI-powered content generation and automation. These examples cover a wide range of applications, from web scraping and email notifications to code review automation, document summarization, recipe generation, and interactive games.

## What does it do?
The examples in this directory showcase different ways to leverage GPTScript and AI technologies for practical applications:

1. Car Notifier: Automates web scraping of car listings and sends email notifications.
2. GPT Review (GitHub Actions and Jenkins): Implements automated code review systems for pull requests.
3. Hamlet Summarizer: Demonstrates large document summarization using chunking techniques.
4. JSON Notebook: Shows how to use GPTScript within a Jupyter Notebook for JSON querying.
5. Node.js Image Generation: Creates a web application for AI-powered logo design.
6. Recipe Generator: Develops a web app that generates recipes based on images of groceries.
7. Treasure Hunt: Builds an interactive game that generates clues for a real-world treasure hunt.

These examples illustrate how GPTScript can be integrated with various technologies and frameworks to create powerful AI-driven applications.

## Key Files
Each example project typically includes:

1. Main application files (e.g., Python scripts, Node.js files)
2. Configuration files (e.g., Dockerfile, requirements.txt)
3. GPTScript files (e.g., .gpt files containing AI prompts and logic)
4. README files with setup and usage instructions

## Dependencies
The examples utilize a range of dependencies, including:

1. GPTScript: The core library for AI-powered content generation
2. OpenAI API: Used by GPTScript for accessing AI models
3. Web frameworks: Flask, Express.js
4. Frontend libraries: Vue.js, Bootstrap
5. Database systems: PostgreSQL
6. Email services: SendGrid
7. CI/CD tools: GitHub Actions, Jenkins

## Configuration
Most examples require configuration of:

1. OpenAI API key as an environment variable
2. Project-specific environment variables (e.g., database URLs, API keys)
3. Docker configurations for containerized applications

These examples provide a comprehensive showcase of GPTScript's capabilities and its potential for integration into various software development and automation workflows.
