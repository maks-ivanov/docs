## High-level description

The target file `examples/table.py` is a script that demonstrates the creation of interactive tables using the `marimo` library. It showcases different table configurations, including single selection, multi-selection, and no selection, using a dataset of characters from the TV show "The Office". The script is structured to run as a standalone application using the `marimo.App` framework.

## Code Structure

The script is organized into several functions, each decorated with `@app.cell`, which is a feature of the `marimo` library to define interactive components or cells in the application. The main components include:

- Initialization of the `marimo` application.
- Definition of markdown cells for documentation and explanation.
- Creation of tables with different selection modes.
- Definition of a dataset representing characters from "The Office".
- Running the application if the script is executed as the main module.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which serves as the main application object. It is used to define and manage the interactive components of the application.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a function as a cell in the `marimo` application. Each cell can perform a specific task, such as rendering markdown, creating UI components, or handling data.

### `office_characters`
#### Description
This is a list of dictionaries, each representing a character from "The Office". Each dictionary contains the character's first name, last name, a skill level represented by a slider, and a favorite place represented by an image.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| office_characters | list | A list of dictionaries with character data. |

### `mo.ui.table`
#### Description
This function is used to create a table UI component. It takes data and configuration options such as selection mode and pagination.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data | list | The data to be displayed in the table. |
| selection | str | The selection mode for the table, e.g., "single", "multi", or `None`. |
| pagination | bool | Whether to enable pagination for the table. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| table | object | A table UI component. |

### `mo.ui.tabs`
#### Description
This function creates a tabbed interface to display different views or components. In this script, it is used to show the table and its current selection.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tabs | dict | A dictionary mapping tab names to components. |

## References

- The `marimo` library is extensively used for creating UI components and managing application state.
- The `mo.ui.table` and `mo.ui.tabs` functions are key components for rendering tables and tabbed interfaces.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| marimo | Used for creating and managing the interactive application and UI components. |

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that the `marimo` library functions and the data provided are correct and valid.

## Logging

The script does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API but provides an interactive interface through the `marimo` application framework.

## TODOs
