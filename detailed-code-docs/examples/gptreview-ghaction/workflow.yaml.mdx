## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow file defines an automated process for reviewing pull requests using GPTScript. It triggers on pull request events, retrieves PR details, runs a code review using GPTScript, and posts the review results as a comment on the pull request.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of a single job named `pr_review` with multiple steps that execute sequentially to perform the code review process.

## Symbols

### `pr_review` (job)
#### Description
This job runs the entire PR review process on an Ubuntu latest runner.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks out the repository
2. Retrieves PR details
3. Installs GPTScript
4. Runs GPTScript for code review
5. Posts the review comment
6. Sets PR status based on the review outcome

### `Get PR Details` (step)
#### Description
Extracts relevant information about the pull request from the GitHub event payload.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| PR_URL | string | The URL of the pull request |
| PR_NUMBER | integer | The number of the pull request |
| PR_FILES | integer | The number of changed files in the pull request |

#### Internal Logic
Uses `jq` to parse the GitHub event JSON and extract PR details, then sets them as environment variables.

### `Install GPTScript` (step)
#### Description
Installs GPTScript using a curl command that downloads and executes an installation script.

### `Run GPTScript for Code Review` (step)
#### Description
Executes GPTScript to perform the code review on the pull request.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | secret | API key for OpenAI services |
| GH_TOKEN | secret | GitHub token for authentication |
| PR_URL | string | The URL of the pull request to review |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| REVIEW | string | The generated code review content |

#### Internal Logic
Runs the `gptscript` command with the `codereview.gpt` script, passing the PR_URL as an argument. The output is captured and stored in the REVIEW environment variable.

### `Post Review Comment` (step)
#### Description
Posts the generated code review as a comment on the pull request.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| GITHUB_TOKEN | secret | GitHub token for authentication |
| REVIEW | string | The generated code review content |

#### Internal Logic
Uses the `gh` CLI tool to post a comment on the pull request with the content of the REVIEW variable.

### `Set PR Status Fail` (step)
#### Description
Sets the PR status to fail if the review requires changes.

#### Internal Logic
Checks if the REVIEW content contains "Require Changes". If true, it prints a message and exits with a non-zero status code, causing the workflow to fail.

### `Set PR Status Pass` (step)
#### Description
Sets the PR status to pass if the review approves the changes.

#### Internal Logic
Checks if the REVIEW content contains "Approved". If true, it prints a message indicating approval.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v2 | Checks out the repository code |
| jq | Parses JSON data from GitHub event payload |
| curl | Downloads the GPTScript installation script |
| gptscript | Performs the code review |
| gh CLI | Posts comments on the pull request |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | secret | N/A | API key for OpenAI services |
| GH_TOKEN | secret | N/A | GitHub token for authentication |

## Error Handling
The workflow includes basic error handling:
- If the GPTScript review requires changes, the workflow will fail (exit code 1).
- If the GPTScript review approves the changes, the workflow will pass.

## API/Interface Reference
| Trigger | Event | Description |
|:--------|:------|:------------|
| pull_request | opened, synchronize, reopened | Triggers the workflow when a PR is opened, updated, or reopened |

This workflow interacts with the GitHub API through the `gh` CLI tool to post comments on pull requests.
