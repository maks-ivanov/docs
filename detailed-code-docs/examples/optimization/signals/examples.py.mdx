## High-level description

The target file, `examples/optimization/signals/examples.py`, is a script designed to demonstrate the use of the `marimo` library for data analysis and visualization. It sets up an application using `marimo.App` and defines a series of cells that load, process, and visualize both real and synthetic datasets. The script showcases various data decomposition techniques, such as trend analysis and changepoint detection, using the `marimo` framework's capabilities to create interactive and reactive notebooks.

## Code Structure

The script is structured around the `marimo.App` framework, which allows for the creation of reactive notebooks. Each function decorated with `@app.cell` represents a cell in the notebook, which can perform tasks such as data loading, processing, visualization, and markdown rendering. The script uses a combination of data loaders, plotting libraries, and solution modules to demonstrate different data analysis techniques.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
`app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which serves as the main application object for the notebook. It manages the execution of cells and the overall flow of the notebook.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define a cell in the `marimo` notebook. Each decorated function represents a cell that can perform a specific task, such as rendering markdown, plotting data, or processing datasets.

### `dataloaders`
#### Description
`dataloaders` is a module imported within the script that provides functions to load various datasets used in the examples, such as CO2 data, solar power generation data, and synthetic datasets for changepoint detection and soiling analysis.

### `solutions`
#### Description
`solutions` is a module that contains functions to solve specific data analysis problems, such as decomposing time series data into components. It provides problem-specific methods like `co2_problem`, `pvdaq_problem`, and `basic_changepoint_problem_exact`.

### `mo`
#### Description
`mo` is an alias for the `marimo` module, which provides various utilities for creating markdown content, UI elements, and managing the reactive execution of cells.

### `plt`
#### Description
`plt` is an alias for `matplotlib.pyplot`, a plotting library used to create visualizations within the notebook cells.

### `np`
#### Description
`np` is an alias for the `numpy` library, used for numerical operations and data manipulation within the script.

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors within the cells. It relies on the `marimo` framework to manage the execution flow and any potential errors that may arise during cell execution.

## Logging

The script does not implement any specific logging mechanisms. It primarily focuses on data visualization and analysis within the `marimo` notebook environment.

## API/Interface Reference

The script does not expose an API or public interface. It is intended to be run as a standalone `marimo` notebook application, demonstrating various data analysis techniques.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
