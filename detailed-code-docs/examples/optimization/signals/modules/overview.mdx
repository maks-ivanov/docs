## High-level description

The `modules` directory within the `examples/optimization/signals` project is designed to handle various aspects of signal decomposition, particularly in the context of environmental and solar energy data. It provides a comprehensive framework for defining, managing, and solving signal decomposition problems using a variety of components and datasets. The directory includes modules for data loading, component management, problem definition, and visualization, all of which are essential for analyzing and breaking down complex signals into simpler, interpretable components.

## What does it do?

The modules in this directory collectively enable the decomposition of complex signals into simpler components, which can be analyzed and interpreted more easily. This process is particularly useful in fields like environmental science and solar energy, where understanding the underlying patterns and trends in data is crucial.

1. **Data Loading and Generation**: The `dataloaders.py` module provides functions to fetch and preprocess real-world datasets, such as CO2 emissions and solar power data, as well as generate synthetic datasets for testing purposes. This ensures that the data is in a suitable format for analysis and modeling.

2. **Component Management**: The `components.py` module defines various types of signal components and their parameters, allowing users to construct and manage these components effectively. It also provides utility functions for sorting and generating UI controls for component parameters.

3. **Problem Definition and Solving**: The `problems.py` and `solutions.py` modules define specific signal decomposition problems and provide the necessary tools to solve them. These problems are tailored to different types of signals, such as CO2 emissions, solar power generation, and soiling effects on solar panels. The modules use the `gfosd` library to configure and solve these optimization problems.

4. **Visualization and Explanation**: The `intro_problem.py` and `explainer.py` modules offer functionality for visualizing signals and their decompositions, as well as providing explanations for different component types. This helps users understand the results of the decomposition and the role of each component.

5. **Image Handling**: The `layout.py` module provides functionality to convert images to base64-encoded strings and create image elements using the `marimo` library. This is useful for embedding images directly into HTML or other documents.

## Entry points
