## High-level description

The target file, `intro_problem.py`, is part of a signal decomposition module that generates synthetic data and provides a framework for decomposing signals into simpler components. It defines a class `IntroProblem` that initializes with synthetic data and offers methods to plot the data and its decomposition into specified components using the `gfosd` library.

## Code Structure

- The `IntroProblem` class is the main component, which uses the `generate_synthetic_data` function to create synthetic time-series data.
- The class provides methods to plot the original data and its decomposition into components.
- The decomposition is achieved using the `gfosd.Problem` class, which is part of the `gfosd` library, and the components are specified using the `components` module.

## References

- `gfosd`: A library used for signal decomposition.
- `components`: A module that defines various component classes and utilities for signal decomposition.
- `problems`: A module that provides plotting utilities.

## Symbols

### `generate_synthetic_data`
#### Description
Generates synthetic time-series data consisting of a sine wave, a linear trend, and random noise.

#### Inputs
| Name  | Type | Description                  |
|:------|:-----|:-----------------------------|
| seed  | int  | Seed for random number generation. |
| samples | int | Number of samples in the generated data. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description                  |
|:-----|:-----|:-----------------------------|
| data | Data | An object containing time and signal arrays. |

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the random seed for reproducibility.
- Generates a time array `t` and constructs a sine wave, a linear trend, and random noise.
- Combines these components into a signal and returns it as a `Data` object.

### `IntroProblem`
#### Description
A class that encapsulates a signal decomposition problem using synthetic data and provides methods to plot the data and its decomposition.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description                  |
|:-----|:-----|:-----------------------------|
| seed | int  | Seed for generating synthetic data. |

#### Outputs
- None directly, but provides methods for plotting.

#### Internal Logic
- Initializes with synthetic data generated by `generate_synthetic_data`.
- Defines a set of component options for decomposition using the `components` module.
- Provides a `plot` method to visualize the original signal.
- Provides a `plot_decomp` method to visualize the decomposition of the signal into specified components.

## Side Effects
- The `generate_synthetic_data` function sets the random seed, which affects any subsequent random number generation.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `gfosd` | Used for signal decomposition. |
| `numpy` | Used for numerical operations and data manipulation. |
| `components` | Provides component classes for signal decomposition. |
| `problems` | Provides plotting utilities. |

## Error Handling
The code does not explicitly handle errors. It assumes that inputs are valid and that the `gfosd` library functions as expected.

## Logging
The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## TODOs
No TODOs or notes are present in the code.
