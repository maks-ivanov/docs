## High-level description

The `explainer.py` file provides a function `explainer` that returns descriptive explanations for different types of signal decomposition components. These components are part of a library defined in the `components` module. The function is designed to help users understand the purpose and characteristics of each component class used in signal decomposition tasks.

## Code Structure

The main symbol in this file is the `explainer` function. It utilizes a dictionary to map component names from the `components` module to their respective explanations. The `components` module is imported as `LIB`, and its attributes are used as keys in the dictionary.

## Symbols

### `explainer`
#### Description
The `explainer` function provides a textual explanation for a given component class name. It is intended to help users understand the role and behavior of different components in signal decomposition.

#### Inputs
| Name      | Type   | Description                                      |
|:----------|:-------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| component | str    | The name of the component class to be explained. |

#### Outputs
| Name      | Type          | Description                                      |
|:----------|:--------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| output    | Optional[str] | A string containing the explanation of the component, or `None` if the component is not recognized. |

#### Internal Logic
- The function defines a dictionary `explainers` where keys are component names from the `components` module, and values are formatted strings explaining each component.
- It checks if the provided `component` exists in the `explainers` dictionary.
- If the component is found, it returns the corresponding explanation; otherwise, it returns `None`.

## References

- The `explainer` function references the `components` module, specifically the `Components` class, to access component names like `ASYMMETRIC_SMALL`, `UNIFORMLY_SMALL`, etc.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose                                      |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------------|
| components | Provides the component class names used as keys in the `explainers` dictionary. |

## Error Handling

The function handles the case where an unrecognized component name is provided by returning `None`. This is a simple form of error handling to ensure that the function does not fail when given an invalid input.

## Logging

There is no logging implemented in this code.

## API/Interface Reference

The `explainer` function acts as an interface to retrieve explanations for component classes. It does not expose an API endpoint but serves as a callable function within the codebase.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
