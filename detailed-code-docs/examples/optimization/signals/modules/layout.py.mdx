## High-level description

The target file `layout.py` provides functionality to convert an image file into a base64-encoded string and then use this string to create an image element using the `marimo` library. This is useful for embedding images directly into HTML or other documents where base64 encoding is required.

## Code Structure

The code consists of two main functions: `_pillow_image_to_base64_string` and `image`. The `_pillow_image_to_base64_string` function is a helper function used by the `image` function to convert a PIL image into a base64 string. The `image` function then uses this base64 string to create an image element using the `marimo` library.

## Symbols

### `_pillow_image_to_base64_string`
#### Description
This function converts a PIL image object into a base64-encoded string. It is a helper function used to facilitate the conversion of image data into a format suitable for embedding in HTML or other documents.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| img  | `PIL.Image` | A PIL image object that needs to be converted to a base64 string. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| base64_string | `str` | A base64-encoded string representation of the image. |

#### Internal Logic
1. A `BytesIO` buffer is created to hold the image data.
2. The image is saved into this buffer in PNG format.
3. The buffer's contents are encoded into a base64 string.
4. The base64 string is decoded into a UTF-8 string and returned.

### `image`
#### Description
This function takes a file path to an image, converts the image to a base64-encoded string, and then creates an image element using the `marimo` library.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| path | `str` | The file path to the image that needs to be processed. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| image_element | `str` | An image element created using the `marimo` library with the base64-encoded image as its source. |

#### Internal Logic
1. The image is opened from the given file path using PIL's `Image.open`.
2. The image is converted to a base64 string using `_pillow_image_to_base64_string`.
3. A data URL is constructed by prefixing the base64 string with `data:image/png;base64,`.
4. The `marimo.image` function is called with the data URL to create an image element.

- The `marimo` library is used to create image elements.
- The `PIL` (Python Imaging Library) is used to handle image file operations.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Used to create image elements from base64-encoded strings. |
| `PIL`      | Used for opening and handling image files. |
| `base64`   | Used for encoding image data into base64 format. |
| `io`       | Used for creating an in-memory byte stream to hold image data. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors. Potential errors could arise from file I/O operations (e.g., file not found) or image processing (e.g., unsupported image format). It is assumed that the caller will handle any exceptions that may occur.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.
