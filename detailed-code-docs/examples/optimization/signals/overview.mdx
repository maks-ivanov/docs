## High-level description

The `examples/optimization/signals` directory is a comprehensive framework designed to facilitate signal decomposition, particularly in the context of environmental and solar energy data. It provides interactive tutorials and examples using the `marimo` library to guide users through the process of breaking down complex signals into simpler components. The directory includes applications and modules for data loading, component management, problem definition, and visualization, enabling users to experiment with different data decomposition techniques and understand their effects.

## What does it do?

The directory serves multiple purposes:

1. **Interactive Tutorials**: The `app.py` file provides an interactive tutorial on signal decomposition using the `marimo` framework. It guides users through the process of decomposing signals into simpler components, allowing them to experiment with different component classes and understand their effects on signal decomposition. The application is structured as a series of interactive cells that use Marimo's UI components to facilitate user interaction and visualization.

2. **Data Analysis and Visualization**: The `examples.py` file demonstrates the use of the `marimo` library for data analysis and visualization. It sets up an application using `marimo.App` and defines a series of cells that load, process, and visualize both real and synthetic datasets. The script showcases various data decomposition techniques, such as trend analysis and changepoint detection, using the `marimo` framework's capabilities to create interactive and reactive notebooks.

3. **Signal Decomposition Framework**: The `modules` directory provides a comprehensive framework for defining, managing, and solving signal decomposition problems. It includes modules for data loading, component management, problem definition, and visualization, all of which are essential for analyzing and breaking down complex signals into simpler, interpretable components. This process is particularly useful in fields like environmental science and solar energy, where understanding the underlying patterns and trends in data is crucial.

## Entry points

The directory is organized into several key files and modules that handle different aspects of signal decomposition:

- **`app.py`**: This file is the main entry point for the interactive tutorial on signal decomposition. It uses the `marimo` framework to create an interactive application that guides users through the process of decomposing signals into simpler components.

- **`examples.py`**: This file serves as an entry point for demonstrating data analysis and visualization techniques using the `marimo` library. It sets up a reactive notebook environment where users can explore various data decomposition techniques.

- **`modules` directory**: This directory contains several modules that provide the underlying framework for signal decomposition. It includes files for data loading, component management, problem definition, and visualization, each of which plays a crucial role in the overall functionality of the codebase.

## Key Files

- **`components.py`**: Defines classes and functions for managing signal decomposition components and their parameters. It is crucial for constructing and managing the components used in signal decomposition.

- **`dataloaders.py`**: Handles data loading and generation for various datasets, ensuring that data is ready for analysis.

- **`problems.py`**: Provides a framework for defining and solving signal decomposition problems, using real-world and synthetic data.

- **`solutions.py`**: Defines specific signal decomposition problems and configures them using the `gfosd` library.

- **`intro_problem.py`**: Offers a class for generating synthetic data and visualizing its decomposition, useful for understanding the decomposition process.

- **`explainer.py`**: Provides explanations for different component types, helping users understand their roles in signal decomposition.

- **`layout.py`**: Converts images to base64-encoded strings and creates image elements, useful for embedding images in documents.

## Dependencies

The directory relies on several external libraries and frameworks:

- **`marimo`**: Provides the framework for building interactive applications and reactive notebooks.
- **`gfosd`**: Used for signal decomposition and component construction.
- **`numpy`**: Provides numerical operations and data structures.
- **`matplotlib.pyplot`**: Used for plotting and visualizing data.
- **`pandas`**: Used for data manipulation and handling time-series data.
- **`PIL` (Python Imaging Library)**: Used for opening and handling image files.
- **`base64`**: Used for encoding image data into base64 format.
- **`io`**: Used for creating an in-memory byte stream to hold image data.
- **`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`**: Used for scaling data in the `Soiling` class.

These dependencies are chosen for their capabilities in handling data, performing numerical operations, and providing the necessary tools for signal decomposition and visualization.
