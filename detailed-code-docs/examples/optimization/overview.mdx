## High-level description

The `examples/optimization` directory contains Python scripts and modules that demonstrate various optimization techniques using interactive applications. These examples leverage the `marimo` library to create user-friendly interfaces that allow users to experiment with different optimization problems and visualize the results. The directory includes scripts for exploring regularization and sparsity in least squares regression, signal decomposition, and computing the smallest enclosing circle for a set of circles. Each script is designed to provide an educational and interactive experience, showcasing the power of optimization in different contexts.

## What does it do?

The directory serves as a collection of interactive tutorials and examples that illustrate different optimization techniques:

1. **Regularization and Sparsity**: The `regularization_and_sparsity.py` script demonstrates the impact of L1 and L2 regularization on the sparsity of solutions in a least squares regression problem. Users can adjust the regularization parameter and observe how the solutions change in terms of sparsity.

2. **Signal Decomposition**: The `signals` subdirectory provides a comprehensive framework for signal decomposition, particularly in the context of environmental and solar energy data. It includes interactive tutorials and examples that guide users through the process of breaking down complex signals into simpler components, using various data decomposition techniques.

3. **Smallest Enclosing Circle**: The `smallest_enclosing_circle.py` script creates an interactive application for computing the smallest enclosing circle for a set of randomly generated circles. Users can select the number of circles and visualize the result, gaining insights into the optimization process involved in finding the smallest enclosing circle.

## Entry points

The directory is organized into several key files and modules that handle different aspects of optimization:

- **`regularization_and_sparsity.py`**: This file is the main entry point for exploring regularization techniques in least squares regression. It uses the `marimo` framework to create an interactive application that allows users to experiment with different regularization strengths and observe the effects on solution sparsity.

- **`signals` subdirectory**: This subdirectory contains multiple entry points, including `app.py` for interactive tutorials on signal decomposition and `examples.py` for demonstrating data analysis and visualization techniques. These files set up reactive notebook environments where users can explore various data decomposition techniques.

- **`smallest_enclosing_circle.py`**: This file serves as an entry point for computing the smallest enclosing circle for a set of circles. It uses the `marimo` framework to create an interactive application that allows users to visualize the optimization process.

## Key Files

- **`components.py`**: Located in the `signals` subdirectory, this file defines classes and functions for managing signal decomposition components and their parameters, essential for constructing and managing the components used in signal decomposition.

- **`dataloaders.py`**: Also in the `signals` subdirectory, this file handles data loading and generation for various datasets, ensuring that data is ready for analysis.

- **`problems.py`**: Provides a framework for defining and solving signal decomposition problems, using real-world and synthetic data.

- **`solutions.py`**: Defines specific signal decomposition problems and configures them using the `gfosd` library.

- **`intro_problem.py`**: Offers a class for generating synthetic data and visualizing its decomposition, useful for understanding the decomposition process.

- **`explainer.py`**: Provides explanations for different component types, helping users understand their roles in signal decomposition.

- **`layout.py`**: Converts images to base64-encoded strings and creates image elements, useful for embedding images in documents.

## Dependencies

The directory relies on several external libraries and frameworks:

- **`marimo`**: Provides the framework for building interactive applications and reactive notebooks.
- **`cvxpy`**: Used for defining and solving optimization problems.
- **`numpy`**: Provides numerical operations and data structures.
- **`matplotlib.pyplot`**: Used for plotting and visualizing data.
- **`pandas`**: Used for data manipulation and handling time-series data.
- **`PIL` (Python Imaging Library)**: Used for opening and handling image files.
- **`base64`**: Used for encoding image data into base64 format.
- **`io`**: Used for creating an in-memory byte stream to hold image data.
- **`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`**: Used for scaling data in the `Soiling` class.

These dependencies are chosen for their capabilities in handling data, performing numerical operations, and providing the necessary tools for optimization and visualization.
