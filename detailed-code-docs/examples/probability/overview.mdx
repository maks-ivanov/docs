## High-level description

The `bayes_theorem.py` file is an interactive notebook created using the `marimo` library. It provides a visual and interactive explanation of Bayes' Theorem, allowing users to adjust probabilities using sliders and visualize the results through a probability plot. The notebook is designed to help users understand the theorem by manipulating the probabilities of events and observing the changes in the calculated conditional probability.

## Code Structure

The code is structured using the `marimo` library, which allows for the creation of interactive notebooks. The main components of the code are:

- **App Initialization**: The `marimo.App` is initialized with a full-width layout.
- **Interactive Cells**: Several `@app.cell` decorators are used to define interactive components, such as markdown explanations, sliders for input, and a probability plot.
- **Probability Calculation**: The code calculates the probability of a hypothesis given evidence using Bayes' Theorem and visualizes it.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
The `app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which serves as the main application object for the interactive notebook. It manages the layout and execution of the interactive cells.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define individual interactive components within the notebook. Each cell can contain markdown, UI elements, or logic for calculations and visualizations.

### `mo.md`
#### Description
The `mo.md` function is used to render markdown content within a cell. It is used to provide explanations and mathematical formulas related to Bayes' Theorem.

### `mo.ui.slider`
#### Description
The `mo.ui.slider` function creates a slider UI element that allows users to input probabilities. It is used to adjust the values of $P(H)$, $P(E \mid H)$, and $P(E \mid \neg H)$.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| label | str | The label for the slider, indicating the probability it represents. |
| value | float | The default value of the slider. |
| step | float | The increment step for the slider. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| slider | Slider object | A slider UI element for user interaction. |

### `construct_probability_plot`
#### Description
A function that constructs a probability plot using `matplotlib`. It visualizes the areas representing different probabilities involved in Bayes' Theorem.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a base rectangle representing the total probability space.
- Adds rectangles for $H$, $E \cap H$, and $E \cap \neg H$ with different colors and opacities.
- Uses `matplotlib` to render the plot and returns the plot object.

### `bayes_result`
#### Description
A calculated value representing the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence, $P(H \mid E)$, using Bayes' Theorem.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| bayes_result | float | The calculated conditional probability. |

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo` | Used to create the interactive notebook and UI components. |
| `matplotlib` | Used for plotting the probability visualization. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors, as it primarily relies on the `marimo` library for UI interactions and `matplotlib` for plotting. Any errors would likely arise from incorrect usage of these libraries or invalid input values.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms. It is designed for interactive use, where feedback is provided directly through the UI.

## API/Interface Reference

The code does not expose an API. It is an interactive notebook meant for educational purposes, allowing users to interact with the UI to understand Bayes' Theorem.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code. The code appears to be complete and functional for its intended purpose.
