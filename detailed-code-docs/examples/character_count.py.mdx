## High-level description

The `character_count.py` file is a simple application built using the `marimo` framework. It provides a user interface where users can input text, and it displays the character count of the entered text. The application is structured using `marimo`'s cell-based architecture, which allows for modular and reactive UI components.

## Code Structure

The code is structured using the `marimo` framework's `App` and `cell` decorators. Each `@app.cell` function represents a reactive component of the application. The functions are executed in sequence to build the UI and handle user interactions. The main symbols in the code are the `app` instance and the cell functions, which are used to define the UI and its behavior.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
The `app` is an instance of `marimo.App`, which serves as the main application object. It manages the lifecycle of the application and coordinates the execution of the cell functions.

### `@app.cell`
#### Description
The `@app.cell` decorator is used to define reactive components within the `marimo` application. Each decorated function represents a cell that can react to changes in its inputs and update the UI accordingly.

#### Inputs
- The inputs to each cell function vary, but they typically include instances of `marimo` components or data from previous cells.

#### Outputs
- The outputs of each cell function are typically UI components or data that are passed to subsequent cells.

### Cell Functions
#### Description
Each cell function is responsible for a specific part of the UI or application logic. They are executed in sequence to build the application.

#### Internal Logic
1. **First Cell Function**: Imports the `marimo` module and returns it for use in subsequent cells.
2. **Second Cell Function**: Uses `marimo` to display a markdown header titled "Character Count".
3. **Third Cell Function**: Creates a text area input for the user to enter text, with a placeholder and label.
4. **Fourth Cell Function**: Calculates the length of the text entered by the user and displays it using markdown.

## Side Effects

- The application modifies the UI by creating and updating components based on user input.
- The character count is dynamically updated as the user types in the text area.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `marimo`   | Provides the framework for building the reactive UI application. |

## Error Handling

The code does not explicitly handle errors. It relies on the `marimo` framework to manage any exceptions or errors that occur during the execution of the cell functions.

## Logging

The code does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference

The code does not expose an API or public interface. It is a standalone application intended to be run as a script.

## TODOs

There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.
