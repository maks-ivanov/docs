## High-level description
The `cliconfig.go` file defines structures and functions for managing GPTScript CLI configuration, including authentication and credential storage. It provides functionality to read, write, and manipulate configuration data, with a focus on handling authentication for various tools and services.

## Code Structure
The main symbols in this code are:
1. `AuthConfig`: A struct representing authentication configuration.
2. `CLIConfig`: A struct holding the overall CLI configuration.
3. `ReadCLIConfig`: A function to read and parse the CLI configuration file.

These symbols are interconnected, with `CLIConfig` containing a map of `AuthConfig` instances. The `ReadCLIConfig` function creates and populates a `CLIConfig` struct.

## Symbols

### `AuthConfig`
#### Description
A struct that represents authentication configuration, derived from `types.AuthConfig`.

#### Internal Logic
- Implements custom `MarshalJSON` and `UnmarshalJSON` methods to handle encoding and decoding of authentication data.
- Encodes username and password into a base64-encoded `Auth` field during marshaling.
- Decodes the `Auth` field back into username and password during unmarshaling.

### `CLIConfig`
#### Description
A struct that holds the overall CLI configuration, including authentication data and other settings.

#### Internal Logic
- Manages a map of `AuthConfig` instances for different server addresses.
- Implements methods for sanitizing, saving, and retrieving authentication configurations.
- Uses a mutex for thread-safe operations on the `auths` map.

### `ReadCLIConfig`
#### Description
A function that reads and parses the CLI configuration file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| gptscriptConfigFile | string | Path to the configuration file |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| *CLIConfig | *CLIConfig | Pointer to the parsed CLI configuration |
| error | error | Error, if any occurred during reading or parsing |

#### Internal Logic
1. Determines the configuration file path based on input, environment variable, or default location.
2. Reads the configuration file.
3. Unmarshals the JSON data into a `CLIConfig` struct.
4. Sets a default credential store if none is specified.
5. Validates the credential store setting.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| encoding/base64 | For encoding/decoding authentication data |
| encoding/json | For marshaling/unmarshaling JSON data |
| github.com/adrg/xdg | For handling XDG Base Directory Specification |
| github.com/docker/cli/cli/config/types | For Docker CLI configuration types |

## Error Handling
The code implements error checking and returns errors for various scenarios, such as file reading failures, JSON unmarshaling errors, and invalid credential store settings.

## Configuration
The code defines configuration options for credential stores based on the operating system:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| CredentialsStore | string | OS-dependent | The credential store to use (e.g., "osxkeychain", "wincred", "secretservice") |

## Performance Considerations
The code uses a mutex (`authsLock`) to ensure thread-safe access to the `auths` map in the `CLIConfig` struct, which is important for concurrent operations on the configuration data.
