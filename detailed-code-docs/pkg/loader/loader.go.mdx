## High-level description
This code defines a package `loader` that provides functionality for loading and parsing GPTScript programs and tools. It handles loading from local files, remote URLs, and OpenAPI specifications, and assembles them into a structured program representation.

## Code Structure
The main symbols in this code are interconnected to form a pipeline for loading and processing GPTScript programs:

1. `ProgramFromSource` and `Program` are the entry points for loading programs.
2. These functions use `resolve` to locate and load the source content.
3. `readTool` is used to parse the loaded content into tool definitions.
4. `link` is used to connect tools and resolve references between them.
5. Various helper functions like `loadLocal`, `loadURL`, and `loadOpenAPI` are used throughout the process.

## Symbols

### `ProgramFromSource`
#### Description
Loads a GPTScript program from a given source content string.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the operation |
| content | string | The source content of the program |
| subToolName | string | Name of a specific sub-tool to load (optional) |
| opts | ...Options | Additional options for loading |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| types.Program | struct | The loaded program |
| error | error | Any error encountered during loading |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new `types.Program` struct.
2. Calls `readTool` to parse the content into tool definitions.
3. Sets the entry tool ID for the program.

### `Program`
#### Description
Loads a GPTScript program from a given name or path.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the operation |
| name | string | Name or path of the program to load |
| subToolName | string | Name of a specific sub-tool to load (optional) |
| opts | ...Options | Additional options for loading |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| types.Program | struct | The loaded program |
| error | error | Any error encountered during loading |

#### Internal Logic
1. Normalizes the input name.
2. Creates a new `types.Program` struct.
3. Calls `resolve` to locate and load the program content.
4. Sets the entry tool ID for the program.

### `resolve`
#### Description
Resolves and loads a tool or program from a given name or path.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the tool is a built-in tool.
2. If not, calls `input` to load the source content.
3. Calls `readTool` to parse the content into tool definitions.
4. Returns the resulting tools.

### `readTool`
#### Description
Parses the content of a source into tool definitions.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the content is a pre-assembled program.
2. If not, attempts to parse as OpenAPI specification.
3. If not OpenAPI, parses as GPTScript.
4. Calls `link` to resolve references between tools.

### `link`
#### Description
Links tools together, resolving references between them.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds the tool to the program's tool set.
2. Resolves references to other tools.
3. Sets default values for the tool.

## Error Handling
The code uses Go's standard error handling mechanisms, returning errors from functions where they occur. It includes custom error types like `types.ErrToolNotFound` for specific error conditions.

## Performance Considerations
The code implements caching for OpenAPI documents to improve performance when loading the same document multiple times. The `CacheTimeout` constant is set to one hour, indicating how long cached items are considered valid.
