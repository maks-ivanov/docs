title: "log.go"

## High-level description
This file defines a package-level variable `log` for the `loader` package. It utilizes the `mvl` (Minimal Verbosity Logger) package from the `gptscript-ai/gptscript` project to create a logger instance.

## Symbols

### `log`
#### Description
`log` is a package-level variable that holds a logger instance created using the `mvl.Package()` function. This logger is likely used throughout the `loader` package for logging purposes.

#### Inputs
This variable doesn't have inputs as it's a declaration.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| log | mvl.Logger (assumed) | An instance of a logger from the mvl package |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/mvl | Provides logging functionality through the `Package()` function |

## Notes
1. The `mvl` package is likely a custom logging solution developed for the GPTScript project, focusing on minimal verbosity.
2. Using a package-level logger variable allows for consistent logging across all files within the `loader` package.
3. The actual usage of this logger is not visible in this file and would be found in other files within the `loader` package.
4. The `Package()` function from `mvl` presumably creates a logger instance specifically configured for package-level logging.

This file serves as a central point for initializing the logger for the entire `loader` package, promoting consistency in logging practices across the package.
