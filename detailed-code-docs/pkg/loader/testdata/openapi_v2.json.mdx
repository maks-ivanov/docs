## High-level description
This file contains an OpenAPI (Swagger) 2.0 specification for a simple Pet Store API. It defines the API's endpoints, request/response structures, and data models for managing pets in a pet store application.

## Code Structure
The JSON file is structured according to the OpenAPI 2.0 specification, with main sections including metadata, server information, paths (endpoints), and definitions (data models).

## Symbols

### Root Object
#### Description
The root object of the OpenAPI specification, containing all the necessary information to describe the API.

#### Internal Logic
- Specifies the OpenAPI version as 2.0 ("swagger": "2.0")
- Provides API metadata in the "info" section
- Defines server and base path information
- Lists supported schemes, content types for requests and responses
- Contains "paths" and "definitions" sections for API endpoints and data models

### Paths
#### Description
Defines the available API endpoints and their operations.

#### Internal Logic
- "/pets": Supports GET (list pets) and POST (create a pet) operations
- "/pets/{petId}": Supports GET operation to retrieve information about a specific pet

### Definitions
#### Description
Defines the data models used in the API.

#### Internal Logic
- "Pet": Represents a pet with id, name, and optional tag
- "Pets": An array of Pet objects
- "Error": Represents an error response with code and message

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /pets | GET | Query param: limit (optional) | 200: Array of Pets, default: Error | List all pets |
| /pets | POST | None | 201: Null response, default: Error | Create a pet |
| /pets/{petId} | GET | Path param: petId | 200: Pet object, default: Error | Get info for a specific pet |

## Dependencies
This file doesn't explicitly define any external dependencies, as it's a specification file rather than executable code.

## Configuration
The API configuration is defined within the specification:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| host | string | "petstore.swagger.io" | API host |
| basePath | string | "/v1" | Base path for API endpoints |
| schemes | array | ["http"] | Supported transfer protocols |
| consumes | array | ["application/json"] | Supported request content types |
| produces | array | ["application/json"] | Supported response content types |

## Error Handling
The specification defines a standard error response structure:

```json
"Error": {
  "required": ["code", "message"],
  "properties": {
    "code": {
      "type": "integer",
      "format": "int32"
    },
    "message": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  }
}
```

This structure is used for unexpected errors in all API endpoints.
