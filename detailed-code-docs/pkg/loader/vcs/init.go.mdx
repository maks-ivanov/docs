title: "init.go"
---

## High-level description
This code is part of a package initialization for a version control system (VCS) loader in the GPTScript project. It imports the GitHub loader implementation, ensuring that the GitHub VCS support is available when the `vcs` package is used.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a single package-level import statement within the `init.go` file of the `vcs` package.

## Symbols

### Package `vcs`
#### Description
The `vcs` package is likely responsible for handling various version control systems in the GPTScript project. This specific file ensures that the GitHub VCS support is loaded.

#### Internal Logic
The file uses a blank import (`_`) to import the `github` package from the project's loader. This import doesn't directly use any symbols from the `github` package but ensures that its `init()` function is executed when the `vcs` package is initialized.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/loader/github | Loads the GitHub VCS support |

## References
The `github` package, which is imported here, likely contains the implementation for GitHub-specific VCS operations. Based on the related code snippet provided (pkg/loader/github/github.go), we can infer that:

1. The `github` package defines a `Load` function that is registered with the loader system in its `init()` function.
2. It provides functionality to interact with GitHub repositories, including fetching commit information, downloading files, and handling authentication.
3. It supports both standard GitHub and GitHub Enterprise configurations.

By importing this package, the `vcs` module ensures that GitHub repositories can be handled by the GPTScript loader system.
