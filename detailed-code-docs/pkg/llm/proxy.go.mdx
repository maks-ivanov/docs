## High-level description
This code implements a proxy server for OpenAI API requests. It handles authentication, forwards requests to the appropriate OpenAI client, and manages the reverse proxy functionality. The proxy is designed to work within a larger system that manages different LLM (Language Model) clients.

## Code Structure
The main components are:
1. `ProxyInfo` method: Sets up the proxy server.
2. `ServeHTTP` method: Handles incoming HTTP requests.
3. `getClient` method (not shown, but referenced): Retrieves the appropriate OpenAI client.

## Symbols

### Registry.ProxyInfo
#### Description
This method initializes and starts the proxy server, returning the proxy token and URL.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| proxyToken | string | Authentication token for the proxy |
| proxyURL | string | URL of the proxy server |
| error | error | Any error encountered during setup |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if a proxy URL already exists.
2. If not, it creates a new TCP listener on a random port.
3. Starts an HTTP server in a goroutine.
4. Sets the proxy URL to the listener's address.

### Registry.ServeHTTP
#### Description
This method handles incoming HTTP requests to the proxy server.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| w | http.ResponseWriter | HTTP response writer |
| req | *http.Request | Incoming HTTP request |

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates the authorization token.
2. Reads and parses the request body.
3. Determines the OpenAI model to use.
4. Retrieves the appropriate OpenAI client.
5. Gets proxy information from the OpenAI client.
6. Sets up a reverse proxy to forward the request to the OpenAI API.

## Side Effects
- Creates and manages a TCP listener and HTTP server.
- Modifies incoming HTTP requests before forwarding them.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| net/http | HTTP server and client functionality |
| net/http/httputil | Reverse proxy implementation |
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/builtin | Default model information |
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/openai | OpenAI client implementation |

## Error Handling
The code includes error handling for various scenarios, such as:
- Authorization failures
- Issues reading the request body
- Failures in retrieving the OpenAI client
- Problems setting up the reverse proxy

Errors are typically returned as HTTP error responses with appropriate status codes.

## Performance Considerations
- The proxy server is started on-demand and listens on a random port.
- It uses a reverse proxy to efficiently forward requests to the OpenAI API.
- The server runs in a separate goroutine to handle concurrent requests.

This implementation provides a flexible and secure way to proxy OpenAI API requests, allowing for centralized management of authentication and client selection within a larger system.
