Here's a detailed documentation for the `assemble.go` file:

## High-level description
This file defines the `assemble` package, which provides functionality to serialize a GPTScript program into a single artifact. The main purpose is to combine the program structure and its tools into a single, easily transportable format.

## Symbols

### `Header`
#### Description
`Header` is a byte slice constant that serves as a magic number or identifier for the assembled GPTScript format. It contains the ASCII representation of the string "GPTSCRIPT!".

### `Assemble`
#### Description
`Assemble` is a function that serializes a GPTScript program into a single artifact. It writes the header followed by a JSON-encoded representation of the program to the provided output writer.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| prg | types.Program | The GPTScript program to be assembled |
| output | io.Writer | The writer to which the assembled program will be written |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | error | An error if the assembly process fails, nil otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
1. Write the `Header` to the output.
2. Use `json.NewEncoder` to encode the `prg` (Program) as JSON and write it to the output.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| encoding/json | For JSON encoding of the program |
| io | For writing the assembled program to an output stream |
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/types | For the Program type definition |

## References
The `Assemble` function is used in the `gptscript.go` file within the `cli` package. It's called when the `--assemble` flag is set, allowing users to create a single artifact from a GPTScript program.

## Performance Considerations
The `Assemble` function performs I/O operations and JSON encoding, which can be relatively expensive for large programs. However, for typical use cases, the performance impact should be minimal.

This assembly process creates a standardized format for GPTScript programs, which can be useful for distribution, storage, or transmission of complete programs in a single file.
