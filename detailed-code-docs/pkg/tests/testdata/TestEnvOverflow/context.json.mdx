## High-level description
This file, named `context.json`, appears to be a compressed or encoded JSON file. It contains a single key-value pair with a base64-encoded or gzipped content. The file is likely used as test data for the `TestEnvOverflow` test case.

## Symbols

### `_gz`
#### Description
The `_gz` key in the JSON object likely stands for "gzipped" or "compressed". Its value is a long string that appears to be base64-encoded compressed data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `_gz` | string | A base64-encoded string representing compressed data |

## Dependencies
This file doesn't directly depend on any external libraries or modules. However, to use this data in tests, the code that reads this file would likely need to use libraries for base64 decoding and gzip decompression.

## Configuration
This file serves as a configuration or test data file. The compressed content may contain environment variables or other context information for the `TestEnvOverflow` test.

## TODOs
- Decompress and decode the content of the `_gz` field to understand the actual test data being used.
- Consider documenting the expected structure of the decompressed data for better understanding of the test case.
