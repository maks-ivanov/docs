## High-level description
This directory, `pkg/tests/testdata`, contains test data and example files used for various test cases in the GPTScript project. It includes subdirectories and files that demonstrate different aspects of GPTScript functionality, such as environment handling, runtime configurations, and system context management.

## What does it do?
The contents of this directory serve several purposes:

1. Provide test data for environment overflow scenarios (TestEnvOverflow).
2. Demonstrate runtime configurations for both general and local development cases (TestRuntimes and TestRuntimesLocalDev).
3. Illustrate the structure and usage of GPTScript system context (TestSysContext).

These test data and examples are crucial for ensuring the correct behavior of GPTScript in various scenarios and for demonstrating how to interact with different aspects of the system.

## Key Files

1. TestEnvOverflow/context.json
   - Purpose: Contains compressed test data for environment overflow scenarios
   - Content: A JSON object with a single key-value pair, where the value is base64-encoded compressed data
   - Role: Provides test input for cases involving large environment variables or contexts

2. TestRuntimesLocalDev/package.json
   - Purpose: Defines a simple Node.js project configuration
   - Content: Project metadata, scripts, and dependencies (specifically the chalk library)
   - Role: Demonstrates how GPTScript might interact with or test Node.js projects

3. TestSysContext/context.json
   - Purpose: Represents a detailed GPTScript execution context
   - Content: JSON structure containing information about the current call, program structure, available tools, and configuration settings
   - Role: Provides a comprehensive snapshot of the GPTScript execution context for testing and debugging

4. TestSysContext/test.go
   - Purpose: Demonstrates how to access and use the GPTScript context in a Go program
   - Content: Go code that reads the GPTSCRIPT_CONTEXT environment variable and processes the context data
   - Role: Serves as an example of how to work with GPTScript context in a real application

## Dependencies
The test data and examples in this directory rely on various dependencies:

1. Node.js and npm (for the TestRuntimesLocalDev example)
   - chalk: "^5.0.0" (for console output styling in the Node.js example)

2. Go standard library (for the TestSysContext example)
   - encoding/json
   - fmt
   - os

3. GPTScript-specific dependencies
   - github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/engine (for the CallContext type in the TestSysContext example)

## Configuration
The test data includes various configuration elements:

1. In TestRuntimesLocalDev/package.json:
   - Project metadata (name, version, description, etc.)
   - Script definitions (e.g., "start": "node example.js")
   - Dependencies (chalk library)

2. In TestSysContext/context.json:
   - Model configuration (e.g., modelName: "gpt-4o")
   - Tool settings (e.g., chat mode, working directory)
   - References to external GPT script files (file.gpt and test.gpt)

3. Environment variables:
   - GPTSCRIPT_CONTEXT: Expected to contain JSON data representing the GPTScript context in the TestSysContext example

These test data and examples provide a comprehensive set of scenarios and configurations for testing various aspects of the GPTScript system, from environment handling to context management and runtime configurations.
