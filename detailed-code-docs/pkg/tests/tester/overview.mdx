I'll provide a comprehensive documentation for the `runner.go` file, focusing on its main functionality and key components.

## High-level description
This file implements a Runner for executing GPTScript programs. It manages the execution flow, handles credentials, and provides a chat-like interface for interacting with the program. The Runner is responsible for coordinating tool calls, managing state, and handling input/output operations.

## Code Structure
The main struct is `Runner`, which contains methods for running and chatting with GPTScript programs. It uses a `Client` for model interactions, a `MonitorFactory` for monitoring execution, and a `RuntimeManager` for managing tool runtimes. The `State` struct is used to maintain the execution state between calls.

## Symbols

### Runner
#### Description
The `Runner` struct is the core component responsible for executing GPTScript programs. It manages the execution flow, handles credentials, and provides methods for running and chatting with programs.

#### Internal Logic
- Initializes with a model client, credential store, and various options
- Manages execution state using the `State` struct
- Coordinates tool calls and handles input/output operations
- Provides methods for running programs and chatting with them

### New
#### Description
Creates a new `Runner` instance with the provided options.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| client | engine.Model | The model client for AI interactions |
| credStore | credentials.CredentialStore | The credential store for managing credentials |
| opts | ...Options | Optional configuration options |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| *Runner | *Runner | A new Runner instance |
| error | error | Any error encountered during initialization |

### Chat
#### Description
Executes a chat interaction with the GPTScript program, managing state between calls.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the operation |
| prevState | ChatState | The previous chat state |
| prg | types.Program | The GPTScript program to execute |
| env | []string | Environment variables |
| input | string | User input for the chat |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ChatResponse | ChatResponse | The response from the chat interaction |
| error | error | Any error encountered during execution |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes or resumes the chat state
2. Starts or resumes the program execution
3. Handles continuations and tool calls
4. Returns the chat response or continues the conversation

### Run
#### Description
Executes a GPTScript program and returns the output.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the operation |
| prg | types.Program | The GPTScript program to execute |
| env | []string | Environment variables |
| input | string | Input for the program |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| string | string | The output of the program execution |
| error | error | Any error encountered during execution |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `Chat` method to execute the program
2. Returns the content of the chat response as the program output

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| context | Provides context for cancellation and timeouts |
| encoding/json | JSON encoding and decoding |
| errors | Error handling |
| fmt | Formatted I/O |
| sort | Sorting utilities |
| strings | String manipulation |
| sync | Synchronization primitives |
| time | Time-related functions |

## Error Handling
The code uses a combination of returned errors and the `require` package from `testify` for error handling. Errors are propagated up the call stack and often wrapped with additional context using `fmt.Errorf`.

## Performance Considerations
- The `Runner` can be configured to run tool calls sequentially or in parallel, which can affect performance depending on the nature of the tools being executed.
- Credential handling is done sequentially to avoid race conditions when prompting users for input.

This documentation provides an overview of the main components and functionality of the `runner.go` file. The file is complex and contains many helper functions and additional logic not covered in detail here due to space constraints.
