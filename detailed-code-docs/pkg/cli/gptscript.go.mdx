## High-level description
This code implements the main command-line interface (CLI) for GPTScript, a tool for running and managing AI-powered scripts. It provides various subcommands and options for executing GPTScript programs, managing credentials, and interacting with language models.

## Code Structure
The main `GPTScript` struct in `gptscript.go` defines the core functionality and options for the CLI. It uses the `cobra` library for command-line parsing and execution. The `Run` method is the entry point for executing GPTScript programs, while other methods handle specific aspects like input/output processing, chat functionality, and model interactions.

## Symbols

### `GPTScript` struct
#### Description
The main struct that encapsulates the CLI functionality for GPTScript.

#### Internal Logic
1. Parses command-line arguments and options
2. Sets up the execution environment (workspace, credentials, etc.)
3. Loads and executes GPTScript programs
4. Handles input/output and chat interactions

### `New() *cobra.Command`
#### Description
Creates and configures the root command for the GPTScript CLI.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| rootCommand | *cobra.Command | The configured root command for the CLI |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new `GPTScript` instance
2. Sets up subcommands (Eval, Credential, Parse, Fmt, Getenv, SDKServer)
3. Configures global flags and options

### `(r *GPTScript) Run(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error`
#### Description
The main execution method for GPTScript programs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cmd | *cobra.Command | The cobra command being executed |
| args | []string | Command-line arguments |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the GPTScript options and environment
2. Handles special cases (UI mode, listing models/tools)
3. Loads and executes the specified GPTScript program
4. Manages chat sessions if applicable
5. Handles output and error reporting

### `(r *GPTScript) Chat(ctx context.Context, prevState runner.ChatState, prg types.Program, envs []string, input string) (runner.ChatResponse, error)`
#### Description
Manages chat interactions for GPTScript programs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the operation |
| prevState | runner.ChatState | Previous chat state |
| prg | types.Program | The GPTScript program |
| envs | []string | Environment variables |
| input | string | User input |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| response | runner.ChatResponse | The chat response |
| err | error | Any error that occurred |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the chat environment and monitor
2. Handles chat state management and continuation
3. Processes user input and generates responses
4. Manages tool executions within the chat context

## Dependencies
- `github.com/spf13/cobra`: Command-line interface library
- `github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/*`: Various GPTScript packages for program execution, chat handling, and model interactions

## Error Handling
The code uses Go's standard error handling mechanisms. Errors are propagated up the call stack and often returned alongside results. The `Run` method is responsible for handling and reporting top-level errors.

## Logging
The code uses a custom logging package (`mvl`) for debug and error logging. Log levels can be controlled through command-line flags.

## Configuration
The `GPTScript` struct contains numerous fields for configuring the behavior of the CLI, including cache options, OpenAI options, display options, and various flags for controlling execution behavior.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the provided code.
