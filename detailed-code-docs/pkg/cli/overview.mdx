## High-level description
This directory contains the command-line interface (CLI) implementation for GPTScript, a tool for running and managing AI-powered scripts. It provides various subcommands and options for executing GPTScript programs, managing credentials, formatting scripts, and interacting with language models.

## What does it do?
The CLI allows users to:
1. Execute GPTScript programs with various options
2. Manage credentials for different contexts and tools
3. Format GPTScript files
4. Parse GPTScript content and output as JSON
5. Retrieve environment variables, including handling compressed values
6. Run a GPTScript SDK server
7. Evaluate inline scripts with customizable parameters

## Entry points
The main entry point is defined in `main.go`, which sets up the execution environment and handles daemon processes if necessary. The core CLI functionality is implemented in `gptscript.go`, which defines the `GPTScript` struct and its methods for command execution and chat interactions.

Key files and their purposes:
- `gptscript.go`: Defines the main `GPTScript` struct and CLI command structure
- `eval.go`: Implements the `Eval` command for executing inline scripts
- `credential.go`, `credential_delete.go`, `credential_show.go`: Handle credential management
- `fmt.go`: Implements the formatting command for GPTScript files
- `parse.go`: Provides functionality to parse GPTScript content
- `sdk_server.go`: Implements the SDK server command

## Dependencies
The CLI relies on several external libraries and internal packages:
1. `github.com/spf13/cobra`: For building the command-line interface
2. `github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/*`: Various internal packages for GPTScript functionality
3. Standard Go libraries: `encoding/json`, `compress/gzip`, `os`, `context`, etc.

## Configuration
The CLI uses a combination of command-line flags, environment variables, and configuration files to set up its behavior. Key configuration options include:
- Cache settings
- OpenAI API options
- Display and output formatting options
- Credential management settings
- Model and tool selection

Error handling is implemented throughout the codebase, with errors being propagated up the call stack and often returned alongside results. The `Run` method in `gptscript.go` is responsible for handling and reporting top-level errors.

Logging is done using a custom logging package (`mvl`) for debug and error logging. Log levels can be controlled through command-line flags.

This CLI provides a comprehensive interface for working with GPTScript, allowing users to interact with AI models, manage scripts, and customize execution parameters through a command-line environment.
