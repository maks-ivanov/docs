## High-level description
This file defines a package-level variable `log` for logging purposes in the `cli` package of the GPTScript project. It utilizes the `mvl` (Minimal Viable Logging) package from the project's internal logging system.

## Symbols

### `log`
#### Description
`log` is a package-level variable that represents a logger instance for the `cli` package. It is created using the `mvl.Package()` function, which likely returns a logger configured for package-level logging.

#### Inputs
This variable doesn't have inputs as it's not a function.

#### Outputs
This variable doesn't have explicit outputs as it's not a function.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/mvl | Provides the logging functionality through the `mvl.Package()` function |

## Notes
1. The `log` variable is likely used throughout the `cli` package for logging various events, errors, or debug information.
2. The use of `mvl.Package()` suggests that the project employs a custom logging solution, possibly for better control over log formatting, levels, or output destinations.
3. As this is a package-level variable, it will be initialized when the package is imported and can be used by any function within the `cli` package without needing to be passed as an argument.
