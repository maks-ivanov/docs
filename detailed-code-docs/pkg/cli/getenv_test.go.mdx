title: "getenv_test.go"

## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `getEnv` function in the `cli` package. The tests verify the behavior of `getEnv` under different scenarios, including when no environment variable is set, when a regular value is set, and when a compressed value is set.

## Symbols

### `TestGetEnv`
#### Description
This function is the main test function that runs multiple test cases for the `getEnv` function. It uses table-driven tests to cover different scenarios.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | Testing object provided by Go's testing package |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a deferred cleanup function to restore the original environment variable value after the tests.
2. Defines a slice of test cases, each with a name, key, default value, environment value, and expected result.
3. Iterates through the test cases, running each as a subtest.
4. For each subtest:
   - Sets the environment variable to the test value
   - Calls the `getEnv` function with the test key and default value
   - Compares the result with the expected value
   - Fails the test if the result doesn't match the expected value

#### Test Cases
1. "NoValueUseDefault": Tests when no environment variable is set, expecting the default value to be returned.
2. "ValueExistsNoCompress": Tests when a regular (uncompressed) value is set in the environment variable.
3. "ValueExistsCompressed": Tests when a compressed value is set in the environment variable, expecting it to be decompressed.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| os | Used to set and get environment variables |
| testing | Go's built-in testing framework |

## Error Handling
The test function uses `t.Errorf` to report failures when the actual result doesn't match the expected result.

## Notes
1. The test uses a deferred function to clean up the environment variable after the tests, ensuring it doesn't affect other tests or the system state.
2. The compressed value test case suggests that the `getEnv` function being tested has the ability to decompress values stored in environment variables.
3. The `getEnv` function itself is not defined in this file, indicating it's likely defined in another file within the same package.

This test file demonstrates good testing practices, including table-driven tests, cleanup of test environment, and testing of edge cases (no value, regular value, and compressed value).
