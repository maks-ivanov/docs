Here's a detailed documentation for the `pkg/embedded/embed.go` file:

## High-level description
This file defines a package `embedded` that provides functionality to run GPTScript in an embedded mode. It allows for customization of the filesystem and sets up the environment for running GPTScript as an embedded application.

## Code Structure
The main function `Run` is the entry point for running GPTScript in embedded mode. It uses the `Options` struct to configure the filesystem and sets up the environment before potentially executing the main CLI functionality.

## Symbols

### `Options`
#### Description
A struct that holds configuration options for the embedded execution.

#### Fields
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| FS | fs.FS | An optional filesystem interface to be used |

### `Run`
#### Description
The main function to run GPTScript in embedded mode. It sets up the environment and potentially executes the main CLI functionality.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| opts | ...Options | Variadic parameter of Options for configuration |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | bool | Indicates whether the main CLI function was executed |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through the provided options and sets the internal filesystem if specified.
2. Calls `system.SetBinToSelf()` to set the binary path.
3. Checks if the `GPTSCRIPT_EMBEDDED` environment variable is set to "true".
   - If true, calls `cli.Main()` and returns true.
   - If false, sets the environment variable to "true" and returns false.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| io/fs | Provides the FS interface used in Options |
| os | Used for environment variable operations |
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/internal | Internal package (likely for shared functionality) |
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/cli | Contains the Main function for CLI execution |
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/system | Provides system-related functionality |

## Side Effects
- Modifies the `internal.FS` variable if a custom filesystem is provided.
- Sets the `GPTSCRIPT_EMBEDDED` environment variable to "true".

## Error Handling
This function does not explicitly handle errors. Any errors that occur during the execution of `cli.Main()` or `os.Setenv()` are not caught or returned.

## Notes
- The function is designed to be called multiple times, but will only execute `cli.Main()` once when the `GPTSCRIPT_EMBEDDED` environment variable is set to "true".
- The return value indicates whether `cli.Main()` was executed, which can be used by the caller to determine if further action is needed.
