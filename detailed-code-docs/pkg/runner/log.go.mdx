title: "log.go"
---

## High-level description
This file defines a package-level logger for the `runner` package using the `mvl` (Minimal Verbose Logging) package from the `gptscript-ai/gptscript` project. It provides a centralized logging mechanism for the entire `runner` package.

## Symbols

### `log`
#### Description
`log` is a package-level variable that holds a logger instance created by calling `mvl.Package()`. This logger is intended to be used throughout the `runner` package for consistent logging.

#### Inputs
This symbol doesn't have explicit inputs as it's a variable declaration.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| log | mvl.Logger (assumed) | An instance of a logger from the `mvl` package |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/mvl | Provides the logging functionality through the `Package()` function |

## Notes
1. The use of `mvl.Package()` suggests that this logging setup is designed to create a logger specific to the `runner` package.
2. The `mvl` package likely stands for "Minimal Verbose Logging," indicating a lightweight logging solution.
3. By declaring `log` at the package level, it can be easily accessed and used by other files within the `runner` package, promoting consistent logging practices across the package.
4. The actual logging methods (e.g., Info, Error, Debug) are not shown in this file but would be available through the `log` variable in other parts of the package.
