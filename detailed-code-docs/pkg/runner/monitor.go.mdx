## High-level description
This code defines a no-operation (noop) implementation of a monitoring system for a runner package. It provides stub implementations for a monitor factory and a monitor, which can be used as placeholders or for testing purposes when actual monitoring functionality is not required.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main structures: `noopFactory` and `noopMonitor`. The `noopFactory` is responsible for creating instances of `noopMonitor`, while `noopMonitor` implements the `Monitor` interface with empty method bodies.

## Symbols

### `noopFactory`
#### Description
A struct that implements a factory for creating no-operation monitors.

#### Methods

##### `Start`
###### Description
Creates and returns a new `noopMonitor` instance.

###### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| context | context.Context | The context for the operation |
| program | *types.Program | The program to be monitored |
| args | []string | Arguments for the program |
| workDir | string | Working directory for the program |

###### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Monitor | Monitor | A no-operation monitor instance |
| error | error | Always nil in this implementation |

##### `Pause`
###### Description
Returns a no-operation function that does nothing when called.

###### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| func() | func() | A function that does nothing when called |

### `noopMonitor`
#### Description
A struct that implements the `Monitor` interface with no-operation methods.

#### Methods

##### `Event`
###### Description
A method that does nothing when an event occurs.

###### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Event | Event | The event to be processed (ignored in this implementation) |

##### `Stop`
###### Description
A method that does nothing when stopping the monitor.

###### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| context | context.Context | The context for the operation |
| reason | string | The reason for stopping (ignored in this implementation) |
| err | error | Any error that occurred (ignored in this implementation) |

##### `Pause`
###### Description
Returns a no-operation function that does nothing when called.

###### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| func() | func() | A function that does nothing when called |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| context | For handling context in the Start method |
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/types | For using the Program type in the Start method |

This code provides a minimal, no-operation implementation of a monitoring system. It can be used as a placeholder in situations where actual monitoring is not required or as a default implementation in testing scenarios. The `noopFactory` and `noopMonitor` structures implement interfaces that are likely defined elsewhere in the codebase, allowing for easy substitution with more complex monitoring implementations when needed.
