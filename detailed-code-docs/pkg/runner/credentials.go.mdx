## High-level description
This code defines a function `parseCredentialOverrides` in the `runner` package. It parses credential override strings provided as command-line arguments, converting them into a structured map format for easier manipulation and use within the application.

## Symbols

### `parseCredentialOverrides`
#### Description
This function takes a slice of credential override strings and parses them into a nested map structure. It supports two formats of input: direct mapping of environment variables and key-value pairs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| overrides | []string | A slice of credential override strings |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| map[string]map[string]string | map[string]map[string]string | A nested map structure representing parsed credential overrides |
| error | error | An error if parsing fails |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initialize an empty map to store credential overrides.
2. Iterate through each override string in the input slice.
3. Split each override string into credential name and environment variables using `:` as a separator.
4. If the split fails, return an error.
5. Create a map for environment variables.
6. Split the environment variables string by `,`.
7. For each environment variable:
   - If it contains `=`, treat it as a key-value pair.
   - If not, treat it as an environment variable name and look up its value using `os.Getenv`.
8. Add the parsed environment variables to the credential override map.
9. Return the complete credential override map and nil error if successful.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| fmt | For error formatting |
| os | To access environment variables |
| strings | For string manipulation operations |

## Error Handling
The function returns an error if it encounters an invalid credential override format. Specifically, it checks if each override string contains a `:` separator. If not found, it returns an error with a descriptive message.

## Performance Considerations
The function uses `make` to pre-allocate maps, which can be more efficient than letting maps grow organically, especially for larger inputs. However, for very large numbers of overrides or environment variables, memory usage could become a concern.

This function is likely not performance-critical unless called frequently with large inputs. Its time complexity is O(n*m), where n is the number of override strings and m is the average number of environment variables per override.
