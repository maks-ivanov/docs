Here's a comprehensive documentation of the `pkg/runner/runner.go` file:

## High-level description
This file implements the core functionality for executing GPTScript programs. It defines the `Runner` struct, which manages the execution of tools and handles chat-based interactions. The runner coordinates between different components like the LLM model, credential management, and monitoring.

## Code Structure
The main symbols in the code are:
- `Runner`: The central struct that manages program execution.
- `MonitorFactory` and `Monitor`: Interfaces for creating and using monitoring capabilities.
- `Options`: Configuration options for the Runner.
- `AuthorizerFunc`: A function type for authorizing tool executions.
- `ChatResponse`: Represents the response from a chat interaction.
- Various event-related types and constants for tracking execution progress.

The `Runner` uses the `MonitorFactory` to create `Monitor` instances for each execution. It interacts with an `engine.Model` for LLM operations and uses a `credentials.CredentialStore` for managing credentials.

## Symbols

### `Options`
#### Description
Defines configuration options for creating a `Runner`.

#### Fields
| Name | Type | Description |

| Authorizer | AuthorizerFunc | Function for authorizing operations |

### `Complete`
#### Description
Merges multiple `Options` instances, with later options taking precedence.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| client | engine.Model | The LLM model client |

### `Chat`
#### Description
Executes a chat interaction with the given program and input.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | Context for the operation |
| prevState | ChatState | Previous chat state, if any |
| prg | types.Program | The program to execute |
| env | []string | Environment variables |
| input | string | Input for the chat |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| resp | ChatResponse | The chat response |
| err | error | Error, if any |

### `Run`
#### Description
Executes a program with the given input and returns the output.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | Context for the operation |
| prg | types.Program | The program to execute |
| env | []string | Environment variables |
| input | string | Input for the program |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | string | The program output |
| err | error | Error, if any |

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external packages and internal modules:
- Standard Go libraries: `context`, `encoding/json`, `errors`, `fmt`, `sort`, `strings`, `sync`, `time`
- Internal packages: `builtin`, `context2`, `credentials`, `engine`, `types`
- External package: `golang.org/x/exp/maps`

## Error Handling
The code uses Go's standard error handling mechanisms. Errors are propagated up the call stack and often wrapped with additional context using `fmt.Errorf`.

## Logging
The code doesn't implement explicit logging. However, the `Monitor` interface provides a mechanism for event tracking, which can be used for logging purposes.

## Performance Considerations
- The `sequential` field in `Runner` allows for controlling whether operations are executed sequentially or concurrently.
- Credential operations are protected by a mutex to ensure thread safety.
- The code uses goroutines for potential concurrent execution of sub-calls.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
