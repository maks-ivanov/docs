## High-level description
This code implements a credential helper system for managing authentication configurations in a Docker-like environment. It provides functionality to store, retrieve, and manage authentication credentials using both a file-based store and an external credential helper program.

## Code Structure
The main structure is `HelperStore`, which combines a file-based store and an external program for credential management. The code defines methods for erasing, getting, and storing credentials, as well as retrieving all stored credentials.

## Symbols

### NewHelper
#### Description
Creates a new `HelperStore` instance with a file-based store and an external helper program.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| c | *config.CLIConfig | CLI configuration |
| helper | string | Name of the external helper program |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| credentials.Store | interface | The created HelperStore |
| error | error | Any error encountered during creation |

### HelperStore
#### Description
A struct that combines a file-based credential store and an external program for credential management.

#### Internal Logic
- `file`: A file-based credential store
- `program`: A function to execute the external helper program

### HelperStore.Erase
#### Description
Erases credentials for a given server address from both the external helper and the file store.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| serverAddress | string | The server address to erase credentials for |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | error | Combined errors from both erase operations |

#### Internal Logic
1. Attempts to erase credentials using the external helper
2. Attempts to erase credentials from the file store
3. Combines and returns any errors encountered

### HelperStore.Get
#### Description
Retrieves credentials for a given server address, prioritizing the external helper over the file store.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| serverAddress | string | The server address to get credentials for |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| types.AuthConfig | struct | The retrieved authentication configuration |
| error | error | Any error encountered during retrieval |

#### Internal Logic
1. Attempts to get credentials from the external helper
2. If not found, falls back to the file store
3. Returns the credentials or an error

### HelperStore.GetAll
#### Description
Retrieves all stored credentials from the external helper.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| map[string]types.AuthConfig | map | A map of server addresses to their authentication configurations |
| error | error | Any error encountered during retrieval |

#### Internal Logic
1. Lists all server addresses from the external helper
2. Processes and corrects server addresses with ports
3. Retrieves individual credentials for each address
4. Returns a map of all credentials

### HelperStore.Store
#### Description
Stores authentication configuration using the external helper.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| authConfig | types.AuthConfig | The authentication configuration to store |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | error | Any error encountered during storage |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/docker/cli/cli/config/credentials | Provides credential store interfaces |
| github.com/docker/cli/cli/config/types | Defines AuthConfig type |
| github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers/client | Implements credential helper client |
| github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers/credentials | Defines credential types and errors |
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/config | Provides CLIConfig type |

## Error Handling
The code uses Go's standard error handling mechanisms. It combines errors from multiple operations using `errors.Join` in the `Erase` method. In the `Get` method, it specifically checks for `ErrCredentialsNotFound` to fall back to the file store.

## Performance Considerations
The `GetAll` method performs individual `Get` operations for each server address, which could be inefficient for a large number of stored credentials. Consider implementing a bulk retrieval method if performance becomes an issue.

This code provides a flexible credential management system that combines the security of external credential helpers with the simplicity of file-based storage, suitable for Docker-like CLI applications.
