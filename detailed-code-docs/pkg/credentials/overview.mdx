## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of a credential management system for the GPTScript project. It provides functionality for storing, retrieving, and manipulating credentials used by various tools and model providers. The system is designed to work with Docker-like credential helpers and configurations, offering a flexible and secure way to handle authentication information.

## What does it do?
The credential management system in this directory performs the following key functions:

1. Defines a `Credential` structure to represent authentication information, including context, tool name, type, environment variables, expiration, and refresh tokens.

2. Implements a credential store that can interact with both file-based storage and external credential helper programs.

3. Provides methods to add, retrieve, remove, and list credentials for different tools and contexts.

4. Offers utility functions for managing credential helper directories and validating credential contexts.

5. Includes a no-operation (noop) credential store implementation for testing or placeholder purposes.

6. Supports conversion between the internal credential format and Docker authentication configurations.

## Key Files

### credential.go
This file defines the core `Credential` struct and related types. It includes methods for credential manipulation and conversion to/from Docker auth config format. Key features include:

- `Credential` struct definition with fields for context, tool name, type, environment variables, expiration, and refresh token.
- Constants for credential types (tool and model provider).
- Methods for checking credential expiration and converting between internal and Docker auth formats.
- Utility functions for combining and splitting tool names and contexts.

### store.go
This file implements the main credential store functionality. It defines interfaces and structures for managing credentials, including:

- `CredentialBuilder` interface for ensuring credential helpers are set up.
- `CredentialStore` interface defining methods for credential management.
- `Store` struct implementing the `CredentialStore` interface using Docker's credential helpers and configuration.
- Methods for getting, adding, removing, and listing credentials.

### helper.go
This file implements a credential helper system that combines file-based storage with an external credential helper program. Key components include:

- `HelperStore` struct that manages both file-based and external program-based credential storage.
- Methods for erasing, retrieving, and storing credentials using the combined approach.
- Functionality to retrieve all stored credentials from the external helper.

### noop.go
This file provides a no-operation implementation of the credential store, useful for testing or as a placeholder. It includes:

- `NoopStore` struct implementing dummy versions of credential management methods.
- Methods that always return empty or nil values, simulating a store with no actual storage.

### util.go
This file contains utility functions for managing credential helper directories, including:

- `CredentialHelperDirs` struct for organizing paths related to credential helpers.
- `GetCredentialHelperDirs` function for generating standardized directory structures.

## Dependencies
The credential management system relies on several external libraries and frameworks:

- github.com/docker/cli/cli/config/credentials: For credential store interfaces and Docker-compatible credential management.
- github.com/docker/cli/cli/config/types: Defines AuthConfig type for Docker authentication.
- github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers/client: Implements credential helper client functionality.
- github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers/credentials: Defines credential types and errors.
- github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/config: Provides CLIConfig type for configuration management.

These dependencies are chosen to ensure compatibility with Docker's credential management system while providing the flexibility needed for GPTScript's specific requirements.

## Configuration
The credential management system uses several configuration options and environment variables:

- `GPTSCRIPT_EXISTING_CREDENTIAL`: Environment variable for existing credentials.
- `GPTSCRIPT_CREDENTIAL_EXPIRATION`: Environment variable for credential expiration.
- `ctxSeparator`: Constant defining the separator used in context strings (default: "///").

The system also relies on configuration provided through the `config.CLIConfig` struct, which is passed to the `NewStore` function when creating a new credential store.

The credential helper directories are configured based on a provided cache directory, with standardized paths for revision files, last checked files, and binary directories.

This credential management system provides a robust and flexible solution for handling authentication information in the GPTScript project, leveraging Docker's credential management patterns while adding custom functionality specific to GPTScript's needs.
