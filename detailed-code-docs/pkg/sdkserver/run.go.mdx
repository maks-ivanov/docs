## High-level description
This code implements a server for executing GPTScript programs. It provides functionality for running GPTScript tools, handling input/output, managing credentials, and streaming events during execution.

## Code Structure
The main components are:
- `server` struct (implied): Handles execution and streaming of GPTScript programs.
- `loaderFunc`: A function type for loading programs.
- `execAndStream`: Main method for executing and streaming results of a GPTScript program.
- Helper functions for processing events, writing responses, and handling errors.

## Symbols

### `loaderWithLocation`
#### Description
Creates a new loader function that includes a specified location in the loader options.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| f | loaderFunc | Original loader function |
| loc | string | Location to be added to loader options |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| loaderFunc | func | New loader function with location included |

### `execAndStream`
#### Description
Executes a GPTScript program and streams the results.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | Context for the execution |
| programLoader | loaderFunc | Function to load the program |
| logger | mvl.Logger | Logger for the execution |
| w | http.ResponseWriter | HTTP response writer |
| opts | gptscript.Options | Options for GPTScript execution |
| chatState | string | Current chat state |
| input | string | Input for the program |
| subTool | string | Sub-tool to be executed |
| toolDef | fmt.Stringer | Tool definition |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes GPTScript with provided options.
2. Loads the program using the provided loader.
3. Starts a goroutine to run the chat and collect output.
4. Processes and streams the output events.

### `processEventStreamOutput`
#### Description
Processes and streams the output events from a GPTScript execution.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | Context for the execution |
| logger | mvl.Logger | Logger for the execution |
| w | http.ResponseWriter | HTTP response writer |
| id | string | Run ID |
| events | &lt;-chan event | Channel for receiving events |
| output | &lt;-chan runner.ChatResponse | Channel for receiving chat responses |
| errChan | chan error | Channel for receiving errors |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up streaming headers.
2. Streams events as they are received.
3. Processes the final output or error.
4. Sends a DONE event when finished.

### `streamEvents`
#### Description
Streams events from a GPTScript execution as server-sent events.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | Context for the execution |
| logger | mvl.Logger | Logger for the execution |
| w | http.ResponseWriter | HTTP response writer |
| run | *runInfo | Information about the current run |
| events | &lt;-chan event | Channel for receiving events |

#### Internal Logic
1. Continuously receives events from the channel.
2. Processes each event and writes it as a server-sent event.
3. Stops when the context is done or a RunFinish event is received.

### Helper Functions
- `writeResponse`: Writes a JSON response to the HTTP writer.
- `writeError`: Writes an error response to the HTTP writer.
- `writeServerSentEvent`: Writes a server-sent event to the HTTP writer.
- `setStreamingHeaders`: Sets the appropriate headers for streaming server-sent events.

## Error Handling
The code uses a combination of returning errors and writing error responses to the HTTP writer. Errors are logged and sent back to the client as JSON responses with appropriate HTTP status codes.

## Logging
Logging is done using the `mvl.Logger` interface, which is passed to various functions. It's used to log debug information, warnings, and errors throughout the execution process.
