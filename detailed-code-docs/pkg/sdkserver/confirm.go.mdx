## High-level description
This code implements a server-side authorization mechanism for GPTScript. It provides functionality to authorize tool calls, handle confirmation requests, and manage the state of waiting confirmations.

## Code Structure
The main components are the `authorize` and `confirm` methods of the `server` struct. These methods interact with a shared `waitingToConfirm` map to manage authorization requests and responses.

## Symbols

### `authorize`
#### Description
This method handles the authorization process for a given context and input.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | engine.Context | The context of the current execution |
| input | string | The input for the authorization request |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| runner.AuthorizerResponse | struct | The response containing the authorization decision |
| error | error | Any error that occurred during the process |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the context is safe using `auth.IsSafe`.
2. If not safe, it creates a channel for the authorization response.
3. Sends an event to notify about the confirmation request.
4. Waits for the confirmation response or context cancellation.

### `confirm`
#### Description
This method handles the confirmation response for a given authorization request.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| w | http.ResponseWriter | The HTTP response writer |
| r | *http.Request | The HTTP request |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the confirmation ID from the request path.
2. Checks if there's a waiting confirmation for the given ID.
3. Decodes the authorization response from the request body.
4. Attempts to send the response to the waiting channel.
5. Sets appropriate HTTP status codes based on the outcome.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the shared `waitingToConfirm` map.
- Sends events through the `events` channel.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |

| fmt | For error formatting |
| net/http | For HTTP request handling |
| time | For timestamp generation |
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/auth | For safety checks |
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/context | For context management |
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/engine | For engine-related types |
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/runner | For runner-related types |

## Error Handling
The code uses error returns and HTTP status codes to handle various error scenarios, such as:
- Multiple authorization requests for the same ID
- Not found confirmation requests
- Failed request body decoding

## Logging
The code uses a logger obtained from the request context for error logging.

## Concurrency
The code uses a read-write mutex (`lock`) to protect access to the shared `waitingToConfirm` map, ensuring thread-safety in concurrent scenarios.
