## High-level description
This code implements HTTP handlers for managing prompts in a server-client architecture. It provides functionality for sending prompts to clients and receiving responses, utilizing a token-based authentication system and managing concurrent prompt requests.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main HTTP handler functions: `promptResponse` and `prompt`. These functions interact with a shared `server` struct that manages prompt channels and authentication. The `writePromptResponse` function is a helper for writing JSON responses.

## Symbols

### `promptResponse`
#### Description
Handles the client's response to a prompt.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| w | http.ResponseWriter | HTTP response writer |
| r | *http.Request | HTTP request object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the prompt ID from the URL path.
2. Checks if a prompt channel exists for the given ID.
3. Decodes the prompt response from the request body.
4. Attempts to send the response through the prompt channel.
5. Sets appropriate HTTP status codes based on the operation's success.

### `prompt`
#### Description
Handles incoming prompt requests from authenticated clients.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| w | http.ResponseWriter | HTTP response writer |
| r | *http.Request | HTTP request object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Verifies the authentication token.
2. Retrieves the prompt ID from the URL path.
3. Checks if a prompt channel already exists for the given ID.
4. Decodes the prompt from the request body.
5. Creates a new prompt channel and stores it.
6. Sends a prompt event to the events channel.
7. Waits for a response on the prompt channel or for the context to be canceled.
8. Writes the prompt response or an error.

### `writePromptResponse`
#### Description
Helper function to write JSON responses for prompts.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| logger | mvl.Logger | Logger instance |
| w | http.ResponseWriter | HTTP response writer |
| code | int | HTTP status code |
| resp | any | Response data to be marshaled to JSON |

#### Internal Logic
1. Marshals the response data to JSON.
2. Sets the HTTP status code.
3. Writes the JSON response to the response writer.
4. Logs any errors that occur during the process.

## Error Handling
The code uses the `writeError` function (not shown in this file) to handle and respond to various error conditions, such as invalid tokens, decoding errors, and not found errors.

## Concurrency
The code uses channels (`chan map[string]string`) to manage concurrent prompt requests and responses. It also employs a read-write mutex (`s.lock`) to safely access and modify the `waitingToPrompt` map.

## Performance Considerations
The code uses non-blocking channel operations in `promptResponse` to avoid potential deadlocks if the prompter is no longer waiting for a response.
