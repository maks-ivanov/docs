## High-level description
This code defines a `SessionFactory` and `Session` struct for managing and monitoring the execution of GPTScript programs. It integrates with a broader system for running AI-powered tools and handles event broadcasting, program execution, and state management.

## Code Structure
The `SessionFactory` creates `Session` instances, which implement the `runner.Monitor` interface. The `Session` struct manages the execution state and broadcasts events related to program execution. The code interacts with other packages like `engine`, `runner`, and `gserver` to coordinate program execution and event handling.

## Symbols

### SessionFactory
#### Description
A factory struct that creates `Session` instances for monitoring program execution.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| events | *broadcaster.Broadcaster[event] | Event broadcaster for sending execution events |

#### Internal Logic
- Creates new `Session` instances with the provided event broadcaster

### NewSessionFactory
#### Description
Constructor function for creating a new `SessionFactory`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| events | *broadcaster.Broadcaster[event] | Event broadcaster for sending execution events |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| *SessionFactory | *SessionFactory | Newly created SessionFactory instance |

### SessionFactory.Start
#### Description
Starts a new monitoring session for a program execution.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | Execution context |
| prg | *types.Program | Program to be executed |
| env | []string | Environment variables |
| input | string | Input for the program |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| runner.Monitor | runner.Monitor | Monitor interface for the session |
| error | error | Error, if any occurred during session creation |

#### Internal Logic
- Retrieves the run ID and tool category from the context
- Broadcasts a run start event if the category is not `NoCategory`
- Creates and returns a new `Session` instance

### Session
#### Description
Represents a monitoring session for a program execution.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the session |
| prj | *types.Program | Program being executed |
| env | []string | Environment variables |
| events | *broadcaster.Broadcaster[event] | Event broadcaster |

### Session.Event
#### Description
Broadcasts an event during program execution.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| e | runner.Event | Event to be broadcasted |

#### Internal Logic
- Locks the session to ensure thread-safety
- Broadcasts the event with additional session information

### Session.Stop
#### Description
Stops the monitoring session and broadcasts a finish event.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | Execution context |
| output | string | Final output of the program |
| err | error | Error, if any occurred during execution |

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if the tool category is not `NoCategory`
- Creates and broadcasts a run finish event with the output and any error

### Session.Pause
#### Description
Pauses the session by acquiring a lock and returns a function to resume.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| func() | function | Function to resume the session |

#### Internal Logic
- Acquires the session lock
- Returns a function that releases the lock when called
