title: "log.go"

## High-level description
This code defines a package-level variable `log` in the `env` package. It initializes `log` using the `mvl.Package()` function from an external library, likely for logging purposes within the `gptscript` project.

## Symbols

### `log`
#### Description
`log` is a package-level variable that is initialized using the `mvl.Package()` function. It is likely used for logging operations within the `env` package.

#### Inputs
This variable doesn't have inputs as it's a package-level declaration.

#### Outputs
The type of `log` is not explicitly stated in the code, but it's the return type of `mvl.Package()`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/mvl | Provides the `Package()` function used to initialize the `log` variable |

## Notes
1. The `log` variable is likely used throughout the `env` package for logging purposes, but its specific usage is not visible in this file.
2. The `mvl` package is part of the same project (`gptscript`), suggesting it's a custom logging solution for this project.
3. The exact capabilities and methods of the logging object returned by `mvl.Package()` are not apparent from this code alone and would require investigation of the `mvl` package implementation.
