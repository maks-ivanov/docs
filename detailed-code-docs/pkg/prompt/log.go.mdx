title: "log.go"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a package named `prompt` and sets up a logging mechanism using the `mvl` package from the `gptscript-ai/gptscript` project. The purpose of this file is to establish a logging instance for the `prompt` package.

## Symbols

### `log`
#### Description
`log` is a package-level variable that initializes a logger for the `prompt` package using the `mvl.Package()` function.

#### Inputs
This variable doesn't have explicit inputs as it's initialized at the package level.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| log | mvl.Logger (assumed) | A logger instance for the prompt package |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/mvl | Provides logging functionality |

## References
The `mvl` package is likely used throughout the `prompt` package for logging purposes. Other files in the `prompt` package would use this `log` variable for logging operations.

## Notes
1. The `mvl` package is part of the `gptscript-ai/gptscript` project, which suggests that it's a custom logging solution for this project.
2. The use of `mvl.Package()` implies that the logging is set up on a per-package basis, allowing for package-specific log configurations or filtering.
3. This pattern of setting up a package-level logger is common in Go projects to provide consistent logging across all files within a package.
4. The actual logging methods (e.g., Info, Error, Debug) are not shown in this file but would be available on the `log` variable based on the methods provided by the `mvl` package.

While this file is very short, it plays a crucial role in setting up logging for the entire `prompt` package, ensuring consistent and centralized logging throughout the package's implementation.
