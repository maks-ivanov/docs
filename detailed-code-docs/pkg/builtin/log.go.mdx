title: "log.go"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a package named `builtin` and initializes a variable `log` using the `mvl.Package()` function from an external package. It serves as a foundation for logging functionality within the GPTScript project.

## Symbols

### `log`
#### Description
The `log` variable is initialized using the `mvl.Package()` function. It likely represents a logging package or module that will be used throughout the `builtin` package for logging purposes.

#### Inputs
This variable doesn't have direct inputs as it's a package-level variable.

#### Outputs
The output type is not explicitly stated, but it's the return type of `mvl.Package()`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/mvl | Provides the `Package()` function used to initialize the `log` variable |

## Notes
1. The `builtin` package is likely a core package in the GPTScript project, providing fundamental functionality.
2. The use of `mvl.Package()` suggests that the project might be using a custom logging or package management system.
3. The actual implementation and usage of the `log` variable are not visible in this file, indicating that it's probably used in other files within the `builtin` package or the broader project.
4. The code is minimal, serving mainly to set up a logging mechanism for the `builtin` package.
