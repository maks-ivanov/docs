## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the builtin package in the GPTScript project. It specifically tests the `SysGetenv` function and ensures that all tools in the package can be displayed correctly.

## Symbols

### TestSysGetenv
#### Description
This function tests the `SysGetenv` function, which retrieves environment variables.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | Testing object for running the test and making assertions |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a progress tracker (discarded in this case).
2. Tests retrieving an existing environment variable:
   - Sets "MAGIC=VALUE" in the environment.
   - Calls `SysGetenv` with a JSON input requesting the "MAGIC" variable.
   - Verifies that the returned value is "VALUE".
3. Tests retrieving a non-existent environment variable:
   - Calls `SysGetenv` with a JSON input requesting the "MAGIC2" variable.
   - Verifies that the returned value indicates the variable is not set.

### TestDisplayCoverage
#### Description
This function tests the ability to display all tools in the builtin package.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | Testing object for running the test and making assertions |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates over all tools returned by `ListTools()`.
2. For each tool, attempts to convert its ID to a display string using `types.ToSysDisplayString`.
3. Verifies that no errors occur during this process.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| context | Provides context for function calls |
| testing | Provides testing framework |
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/types | Used for type conversions |
| github.com/hexops/autogold/v2 | Used for test assertions |
| github.com/stretchr/testify/require | Used for test assertions |

## Error Handling
The tests use `require.NoError(t, err)` to ensure that no errors occur during the execution of the tested functions. If an error occurs, the test will fail.

## References
The tests reference the following functions from the builtin package:
- `SysGetenv`: Used to retrieve environment variables.
- `ListTools`: Used to get a list of all available tools.

Additionally, it uses `types.ToSysDisplayString` from the types package to convert tool IDs to display strings.
