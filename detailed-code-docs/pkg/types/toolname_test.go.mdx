## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `ToolNormalizer` function and the `SplitToolRef` function in the `types` package. The tests verify the correct normalization of tool names and the parsing of tool references with various input formats.

## Symbols

### TestToolNormalizer
#### Description
This function tests the `ToolNormalizer` function with various input strings to ensure it correctly normalizes tool names.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | Testing object for running the test cases |

#### Internal Logic
The test uses the `autogold` library to compare the expected output with the actual output of the `ToolNormalizer` function for different input strings. It covers various scenarios such as:
- Replacing hyphens and underscores with camelCase
- Converting to lowercase except for the first letter of each word
- Handling file paths and extensions
- Dealing with special characters and URL-like strings

### TestParse
#### Description
This function tests the `SplitToolRef` function to ensure it correctly parses tool references with different formats.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | Testing object for running the test cases |

#### Internal Logic
The test uses the `autogold` library to compare the expected output with the actual output of the `SplitToolRef` function for different input strings. It covers scenarios such as:
- Parsing tool references with "from" and "with" clauses
- Handling tool references with and without subtool specifications
- Dealing with "as" clauses in the tool references

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/hexops/autogold/v2 | Used for creating and running golden tests |

## References
The test file references the following functions from the `types` package:
- `ToolNormalizer`: A function that normalizes tool names
- `SplitToolRef`: A function that splits a tool reference into its components

Note: The implementations of these functions are not provided in this file, but they are being tested here.
