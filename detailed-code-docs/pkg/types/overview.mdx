## High-level description
This directory contains types and utility functions for the GPTScript project. It defines structures and methods for handling tools, prompts, completions, and other core concepts of the system. The code provides functionality for parsing, normalizing, and manipulating tool names and references, managing sets of tools, and generating user-friendly display text for various operations.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides the foundational data structures and utilities for the GPTScript system. It enables:

1. Definition and management of tools, including their parameters, credentials, and metadata.
2. Handling of completion requests and responses, supporting various AI model configurations.
3. Normalization and parsing of tool names and references.
4. Generation of user-friendly display text for tool executions and system operations.
5. Management of prompts and credential information.
6. Creation of JSON schemas for API documentation.

These components work together to support the core functionality of GPTScript, allowing for flexible tool definitions, structured AI interactions, and consistent handling of system operations.

## Key Files

1. `tool.go`: Defines the core structures for tools, programs, and tool references. It includes methods for managing tool sets and parsing tool arguments.

2. `completion.go`: Contains types and methods for handling completion requests and responses, supporting various parameters for AI model interactions.

3. `toolname.go`: Provides functions for normalizing tool names, splitting tool references, and selecting unique tool names.

4. `toolstring.go`: Implements functions for generating user-friendly display text for tool executions and system operations.

5. `prompt.go`: Defines structures and constants related to prompts in the GPTScript system.

6. `jsonschema.go`: Contains a utility function for creating OpenAPI 3.0 schema objects, useful for API documentation.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries:

1. `github.com/getkin/kin-openapi/openapi3`: Used for OpenAPI schema handling.
2. `github.com/google/shlex`: Provides shell-style string splitting functionality.
3. `github.com/fatih/color`: Used for colored console output.
4. `github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/system`: Contains system-related constants and default schemas.
5. `golang.org/x/exp/maps`: Offers map manipulation utilities.

## Configuration
The code uses environment variables for configuration in some parts:

1. `PromptURLEnvVar`: Environment variable name for the GPTScript prompt URL.
2. `PromptTokenEnvVar`: Environment variable name for the GPTScript prompt token.
3. `GPTSCRIPT_OPENAPI_REVAMP`: When set to "true", enables pretty-printing of JSON arguments for the "sys.openapi" tool.

These environment variables allow for flexible configuration of the GPTScript system without modifying the code.

The types and utilities defined in this directory form the backbone of the GPTScript system, providing a structured and extensible framework for managing AI-powered tools and interactions. The code emphasizes flexibility, allowing for easy addition of new tools and customization of existing ones, while maintaining a consistent interface for interacting with the system.
