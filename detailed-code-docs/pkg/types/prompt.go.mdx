## High-level description
This Go code defines constants and a struct related to prompts in the GPTScript system. It establishes environment variable names for prompt URL and token, and defines a `Prompt` struct to represent prompt data with various fields.

## Symbols

### Constants
#### Description
Two constants are defined to represent environment variable names:

1. `PromptURLEnvVar`: Represents the environment variable name for the GPTScript prompt URL.
2. `PromptTokenEnvVar`: Represents the environment variable name for the GPTScript prompt token.

These constants are likely used elsewhere in the codebase to access or set these environment variables consistently.

### `Prompt` struct
#### Description
The `Prompt` struct is defined to represent a prompt in the GPTScript system. It contains fields for storing various aspects of a prompt, such as the message, input fields, sensitivity flag, and additional metadata.

#### Fields
| Name | Type | JSON Tag | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| Message | string | `message,omitempty` | The main content or text of the prompt |
| Fields | []string | `fields,omitempty` | A slice of strings representing input fields or options for the prompt |
| Sensitive | bool | `sensitive,omitempty` | A flag indicating whether the prompt contains sensitive information |
| Metadata | map[string]string | `metadata,omitempty` | A map for storing additional key-value pairs of metadata related to the prompt |

#### Internal Logic
The `Prompt` struct uses JSON tags for each field, which suggests that this struct is likely used for JSON serialization and deserialization. The `omitempty` tag on each field means that these fields will be omitted from the JSON output if they have zero values (empty string, nil slice, false boolean, or nil map).

## Dependencies
This code relies on the standard Go `json` package for JSON tag annotations, although it's not explicitly imported in this file.

## Notes
1. The use of environment variables for URL and token suggests that the GPTScript system might be configurable through environment settings.
2. The `Sensitive` field in the `Prompt` struct indicates that the system has a way to handle prompts with sensitive information differently.
3. The `Fields` slice in the `Prompt` struct suggests that prompts can have multiple input fields or options.
4. The `Metadata` map allows for flexible additional data to be associated with a prompt.

This code provides a foundation for working with prompts in the GPTScript system, allowing for structured representation of prompt data and consistent access to configuration through environment variables.
