## High-level description
This file defines a package-level variable `log` in the `types` package. It initializes `log` using the `mvl.Package()` function from the `github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/mvl` package, likely setting up logging functionality for the `types` package.

## Symbols

### `log`
#### Description
`log` is a package-level variable that is initialized using the `mvl.Package()` function. It is likely used for logging purposes within the `types` package.

#### Inputs
This variable doesn't have inputs as it's not a function.

#### Outputs
The exact type of `log` is not specified in the code, but it's the return value of `mvl.Package()`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/mvl | Provides the `Package()` function used to initialize the `log` variable |

## Notes
1. The `log` variable is likely used throughout the `types` package for logging operations, but its specific usage is not shown in this file.
2. The `mvl` package is presumably a custom logging package developed for the gptscript project, as indicated by the import path.
3. The exact capabilities and methods available on the `log` variable would depend on the implementation of `mvl.Package()`.
4. This file sets up logging at the package level, which is a common practice for centralizing and standardizing logging across a package.
