## High-level description
This code provides a function `currentBin()` that returns the full path of the currently executing binary. It's designed to allow forking a new version of the same executable, handling both relative and absolute paths, as well as executables in the system PATH.

## Symbols

### `currentBin()`
#### Description
The `currentBin()` function determines and returns the full path of the currently executing binary. It handles various scenarios to ensure the correct path is returned, including executables in the system PATH and relative paths.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't take any explicit inputs, but it uses `os.Args[0]` to get the name or path of the current executable.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return value | string | The full path of the currently executing binary |

#### Internal Logic
1. Get the name of the current executable from `os.Args[0]`.
2. If the name is just a filename (without path):
   - Use `exec.LookPath()` to find the full path in the system PATH.
   - Return this path if found.
3. If the name includes a path:
   - Try to convert it to an absolute path using `filepath.Abs()`.
   - Return the absolute path if successful.
4. If all else fails, return the original name from `os.Args[0]`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| os | To access command-line arguments (`os.Args`) |
| os/exec | To look up executables in the system PATH (`exec.LookPath`) |
| path/filepath | For path manipulation and conversion to absolute paths |

## References
The code mentions that it's copied from the Moby project (Docker), specifically from:
github.com/moby/moby/pkg/reexec at commit d25b0bd7ea6ce17ca085c54d5965eeeb66417e52

## Performance Considerations
The function performs file system operations (looking up paths and converting to absolute paths) which can be relatively expensive. However, it's designed to minimize these operations by checking conditions before performing them.

## Error Handling
The function handles errors internally without exposing them to the caller. If an error occurs during path lookup or conversion to absolute path, the function falls back to less precise but still functional alternatives.
