title: "log.go"

## High-level description
This file defines a package-level variable `log` for the `monitor` package. It utilizes the `mvl` (Minimal Verbosity Logger) package from the `gptscript-ai/gptscript` project to create a logger instance.

## Symbols

### `log`
#### Description
`log` is a package-level variable that holds an instance of a logger created using the `mvl.Package()` function. This logger is likely used throughout the `monitor` package for logging purposes.

#### Inputs
This variable doesn't have inputs as it's a declaration.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| log | mvl.Logger (assumed) | An instance of a logger created by `mvl.Package()` |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/mvl | Provides the `Package()` function to create a logger instance |

## Notes
1. The `mvl` package is likely a custom logging solution developed for the GPTScript project, focusing on minimal verbosity logging.
2. Using a package-level logger variable is a common pattern in Go for centralizing logging across a package.
3. The actual usage of this logger is not visible in this file and would be found in other files within the `monitor` package.
4. The specific features and methods of the logger depend on the implementation of the `mvl` package, which is not shown here.
