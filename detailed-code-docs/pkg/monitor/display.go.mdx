## High-level description
This code defines a `Console` struct and related functions for monitoring and displaying the execution of a GPTScript program. It provides functionality to track and log various events during the execution, manage the state of calls, and handle the output of the program.

## Code Structure
The main components of this code are:
1. `Console` struct: Manages the overall monitoring process.
2. `display` struct: Handles the detailed tracking and display of events.
3. `livePrinter` struct: Manages real-time printing of progress information.
4. Various helper types and functions for formatting and managing the execution state.

These components work together to provide a comprehensive monitoring and logging system for GPTScript execution.

## Symbols

### `Complete`
#### Description
This function completes the `Options` struct by merging multiple option sets.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| opts | ...Options | Variable number of Options structs |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Options | Merged Options struct |

#### Internal Logic
It iterates through the provided options, setting values in the result struct based on the first non-zero value encountered for each field.

### `Console`
#### Description
The `Console` struct represents the main monitoring interface.

#### Internal Logic
It manages the overall state of the monitoring process, including dump state, message printing, and call locking.

### `Start`
#### Description
Initializes a new monitoring session for a program run.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| _ | context.Context | Context (unused) |
| prg | *types.Program | Program to be monitored |
| _ | []string | Environment variables (unused) |
| input | string | Input for the program |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| runner.Monitor | Interface | Initialized monitor |
| error | Error | Any error encountered |

#### Internal Logic
Creates a new `display` instance, initializes it with the program details, and logs the start of the run.

### `Event`
#### Description
Handles various events during the program execution.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| event | runner.Event | Event to be processed |

#### Internal Logic
Updates the internal state based on the event type, manages the call stack, and handles logging and display of event information.

### `Stop`
#### Description
Finalizes the monitoring session and handles the program output.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| _ | context.Context | Context (unused) |
| output | string | Program output |
| err | error | Any error encountered |

#### Internal Logic
Logs the end of the run, records usage statistics, and optionally dumps the state to a file.

## Side Effects
- Writes to standard error for live progress updates.
- Optionally writes state dump to a file.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/fatih/color | For colored output |
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/counter | For generating unique IDs |
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/engine | For engine-related types and functions |
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/runner | For runner-related types and functions |
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/types | For common types used in the project |

## Error Handling
The code uses error returns to propagate errors up the call stack. It also logs errors in some cases.

## Logging
The code uses a global `log` variable for logging, which is likely initialized elsewhere in the package.

This documentation provides an overview of the main components and functionality of the `display.go` file. The code is quite extensive, so this summary focuses on the key aspects and main structures.
