title: "log.go"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a package named `input` and sets up a logging mechanism using the `mvl` package from the `gptscript-ai/gptscript` project. The purpose of this file is to initialize a logger for the `input` package, which can be used throughout the package for logging purposes.

## Symbols

### `log`
#### Description
`log` is a package-level variable that initializes a logger for the `input` package using the `mvl.Package()` function. This logger can be used throughout the `input` package to log messages, errors, or other relevant information.

#### Inputs
This symbol doesn't have explicit inputs as it's a variable declaration.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| log | mvl.Logger (assumed) | A logger instance for the `input` package |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/mvl | Provides logging functionality |

## Notes
1. The `mvl` package is likely a custom logging package developed for the `gptscript-ai/gptscript` project. It's not a standard Go logging library.

2. The `Package()` function from `mvl` is presumably used to create a logger instance specific to the current package (`input` in this case).

3. This logging setup follows a pattern that is likely used across other packages in the project, as evidenced by the similar `log` variable declaration in the related `gptscript` package.

4. The actual usage of this logger is not shown in this file, but it would typically be used throughout the `input` package for logging various events, errors, or debug information.

5. The logging level, output destination, and other configuration details for this logger are not visible in this file. These are likely set up elsewhere in the project, possibly in a central configuration file or at the application's entry point.

6. Given the minimal nature of this file, it serves as a foundational setup for logging within the `input` package, allowing for consistent logging practices across the entire project.
