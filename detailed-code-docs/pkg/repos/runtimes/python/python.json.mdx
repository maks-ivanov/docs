## High-level description
This JSON file contains a list of Python runtime configurations for different operating systems, architectures, and versions. It provides download URLs and SHA256 digests for standalone Python builds from the indygreg/python-build-standalone GitHub repository.

## Code Structure
The file consists of a single JSON array containing multiple objects, each representing a specific Python runtime configuration.

### Python Runtime Configuration Object
#### Description
Each object in the JSON array represents a specific Python runtime configuration, including details about the operating system, architecture, version, download URL, and SHA256 digest.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| os | string | The target operating system (e.g., "darwin", "linux", "windows") |
| arch | string | The target architecture (e.g., "arm64", "amd64") |
| version | string | The Python version (e.g., "3.10", "3.11", "3.12") |
| url | string | The download URL for the Python build |
| digest | string | The SHA256 digest of the downloaded file for verification |

## Dependencies
The file relies on the indygreg/python-build-standalone GitHub repository for providing the Python builds.

## Configuration
The file serves as a configuration source for Python runtime installations. It covers the following configurations:

| OS | Architecture | Python Versions |
|:---|:-------------|:----------------|
| darwin (macOS) | arm64, amd64 | 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 |
| linux | arm64, amd64 | 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 |
| windows | amd64 | 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 |

## Performance Considerations
The use of pre-built, standalone Python installations can significantly reduce setup time and ensure consistency across different environments.

## Related Code Context
The related test file `python_test.go` contains a test case that uses this configuration file. The test:

1. Creates a `Runtime` struct with a specific Python version.
2. Calls the `Setup` method to install the Python runtime.
3. Verifies that the Python executable is present in the expected location.

This test ensures that the runtime configurations in the JSON file are valid and can be used to successfully set up a Python environment.
