title: "log.go"
---

## High-level description
This Go file defines a package named `python` and sets up a logging mechanism using the `mvl` package from the `gptscript-ai/gptscript` project. It creates a logger specific to this package for potential use in other files within the same package.

## Symbols

### `log`
#### Description
`log` is a package-level variable that holds a logger instance created by calling the `Package()` function from the `mvl` package. This logger is likely intended to be used throughout the `python` package for logging purposes.

#### Inputs
This symbol doesn't have explicit inputs as it's a variable declaration.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| log | mvl.Logger (assumed) | A logger instance specific to the `python` package |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/mvl | Provides logging functionality through the `Package()` function |

## Notes
1. The `mvl` package is likely a custom logging package developed for the GPTScript project, as it's not a standard Go package.
2. The use of `Package()` suggests that the `mvl` package might provide a way to create loggers scoped to specific packages, which can be useful for organizing and filtering log messages.
3. This file sets up the logging infrastructure for the `python` package, but the actual usage of the `log` variable would occur in other files within the same package.
4. The naming of the package as `python` implies that this Go code might be part of a larger system that interacts with or manages Python runtimes or environments.
