title: "python_test.go"
---

## High-level description
This Go code defines a test for the Python runtime setup in the `gptscript` project. It verifies that the Python runtime can be correctly set up and that the Python executable is present in the expected location after setup.

## Symbols

### `TestRuntime`
#### Description
This function is a test case that verifies the setup of the Python runtime.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | The testing object provided by Go's testing framework |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `Runtime` struct with Python version 3.12.
2. Calls the `Setup` method of the `Runtime` struct with necessary parameters.
3. Checks if the Python executable exists in the expected location after setup.
4. Uses `require.NoError` to ensure no errors occur during the setup and file checking process.

#### Side Effects
- Creates temporary files and directories in the test cache home directory.

### `firstPath`
#### Description
A helper function that extracts the first path from a slice of environment variables.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| s | []string | A slice of strings representing environment variables |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| string | string | The first path extracted from the input slice |

#### Internal Logic
1. Takes the first element of the input slice.
2. Splits it by "=" and takes the second part (the value).
3. Splits the value by the OS-specific path separator and returns the first element.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| context | Provides context for the runtime setup |
| errors | Used for error handling and comparison |
| os | Provides OS-specific functionality and environment variables |
| path/filepath | Used for file path manipulation |
| strings | Used for string manipulation |
| testing | Go's testing framework |
| github.com/adrg/xdg | Used to get the cache file path |
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/types | Provides the `Tool` type used in setup |
| github.com/samber/lo | Used for error handling in `lo.Must` |
| github.com/stretchr/testify/require | Provides assertion functions for testing |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| testCacheHome | string | (dynamically set) | The cache directory used for testing |

## Error Handling
The test uses `require.NoError` to check for errors during the setup process and when checking for the existence of the Python executable. If any error occurs, the test will fail.

## Notes
- The test is designed to work on multiple platforms (Windows and Unix-like systems) by checking for both "python.exe" and "python" executables.
- The test uses a specific cache directory for testing purposes, separate from the regular application cache.
- The Python version is hardcoded to 3.12 in this test, which should be kept in sync with the project's requirements.
