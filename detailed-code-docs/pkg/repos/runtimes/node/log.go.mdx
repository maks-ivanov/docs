title: "log.go"
---

## High-level description
This Go file defines a package-level variable `log` for the `node` package. It utilizes the `mvl` (Minimal Viable Logging) package from the `gptscript-ai/gptscript` project to create a logger instance specific to this package.

## Symbols

### `log`
#### Description
`log` is a package-level variable that holds a logger instance created by calling the `Package()` function from the `mvl` package. This logger is intended to be used throughout the `node` package for logging purposes.

#### Inputs
This variable doesn't have inputs as it's a declaration.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| log | mvl.Logger (assumed) | A logger instance specific to the `node` package |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/mvl | Provides logging functionality through the `Package()` function |

## Notes
1. The `mvl` package likely stands for "Minimal Viable Logging" and is part of the `gptscript-ai/gptscript` project.
2. Using a package-level logger variable is a common pattern in Go for centralizing logging within a package.
3. The exact methods and capabilities of the logger depend on the implementation of the `mvl.Package()` function, which is not shown in this file.
4. This setup allows for consistent logging across the `node` package, potentially with package-specific settings or prefixes.
