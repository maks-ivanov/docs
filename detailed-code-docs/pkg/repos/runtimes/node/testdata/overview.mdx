## Configuration
This `package.json` file serves as the configuration for the Node.js project. It defines the project structure, scripts, and dependencies.

## Notes
1. The project seems to be in its initial stages, as indicated by the version number (1.0.0) and the incomplete description.
2. The project uses TypeScript for development, as evidenced by the server script using `tsnd` (likely ts-node-dev) to run a TypeScript file.
3. There are no development dependencies listed, which is unusual for a TypeScript project. Typically, you would expect to see TypeScript and related tools in the `devDependencies` section.
4. The `main` field points to `index.js`, but the server script runs `src/server.ts`. This inconsistency might need to be addressed in the future.
5. The project structure includes an `examples` directory, which suggests that there might be example code or usage demonstrations provided.
