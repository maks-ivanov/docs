## High-level description
This code defines a test for the Node.js runtime setup in the `gptscript` project. It verifies that the `Setup` method of the `Runtime` struct correctly installs and configures a Node.js environment, ensuring that the `node` executable is present in the expected location.

## Symbols

### `firstPath`
#### Description
This helper function extracts the first path from a slice of environment variables.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| s | []string | A slice of strings representing environment variables |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| string | string | The first path extracted from the input |

#### Internal Logic
1. Takes the first element of the input slice
2. Splits it by "=" and takes the second part (the value)
3. Splits the value by the OS-specific path separator and returns the first element

### `TestRuntime`
#### Description
This function tests the `Setup` method of the `Runtime` struct for Node.js.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `Runtime` instance with version "20"
2. Calls the `Setup` method with test parameters
3. Checks if the `node` executable exists in the expected location
4. If not found with `.exe` extension, checks without the extension (for non-Windows systems)
5. Asserts that no errors occurred during the process

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| context | Provides context for cancellation and timeouts |
| errors | Used for error handling and comparison |
| io/fs | Provides file system-related functionality |
| os | Used for environment variables and file operations |
| path/filepath | Used for file path manipulations |
| strings | Used for string operations |
| testing | Provides testing framework |
| github.com/adrg/xdg | Used for XDG Base Directory Specification |
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/types | Provides types used in the gptscript project |
| github.com/samber/lo | Provides utility functions |
| github.com/stretchr/testify/require | Provides assertion functions for testing |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| testCacheHome | string | (dynamically set) | The cache directory used for testing |

## Error Handling
The test uses `require.NoError(t, err)` to assert that no errors occur during the runtime setup and file checks. If an error occurs, the test will fail with an appropriate error message.

## Notes
- The test is designed to work on both Windows and non-Windows systems by checking for both "node.exe" and "node" executables.
- The test uses a specific cache directory for testing purposes, separate from the regular application cache.
- The `Runtime` struct is not fully defined in this file, suggesting it's imported from another package or defined elsewhere in the project.
