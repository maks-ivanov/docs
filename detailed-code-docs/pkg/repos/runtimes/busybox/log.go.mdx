title: "log.go"

## High-level description
This file defines a logging variable for the `busybox` package using the `mvl` (Minimal Verbosity Logger) package from the `gptscript-ai/gptscript` project. It sets up a package-level logger that can be used throughout the `busybox` package for logging purposes.

## Symbols

### `log`
#### Description
`log` is a package-level variable that holds a logger instance created by calling `mvl.Package()`. This logger is specific to the `busybox` package and can be used for logging operations within this package.

#### Inputs
This symbol doesn't have explicit inputs as it's a variable declaration.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| log | mvl.Logger (assumed) | A logger instance for the busybox package |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/mvl | Provides the logging functionality through the `Package()` function |

## Notes
1. The `mvl` package is likely a custom logging package designed for the GPTScript project, focusing on minimal verbosity logging.
2. By creating a package-level logger, all files within the `busybox` package can share this common logger instance, ensuring consistent logging behavior across the package.
3. The actual usage of this logger (e.g., log levels, output formatting) is not visible in this file and would depend on how the `mvl` package is implemented and how the `log` variable is used in other files within the `busybox` package.
