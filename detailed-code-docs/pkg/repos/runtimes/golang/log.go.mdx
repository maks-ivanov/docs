title: "log.go"

## High-level description
This code defines a package-level variable `log` in the `golang` package. It initializes the `log` variable using the `mvl.Package()` function from the `github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/mvl` package, which likely sets up logging functionality for the package.

## Symbols

### `log`
#### Description
`log` is a package-level variable that is initialized using the `mvl.Package()` function. It is likely used for logging purposes within the `golang` package.

#### Inputs
This variable doesn't have inputs as it's not a function.

#### Outputs
The exact type of the `log` variable is not specified in the code, but it's presumably a logger object or interface returned by `mvl.Package()`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/mvl | Provides the `Package()` function used to initialize the `log` variable |

## Notes
1. The `log` variable is likely used throughout the `golang` package for logging operations, but its specific usage is not shown in this file.
2. The `mvl` package is part of the `gptscript` project, suggesting that this logging setup is specific to the GPTScript ecosystem.
3. The exact capabilities and methods available on the `log` object would depend on the implementation of `mvl.Package()`.
