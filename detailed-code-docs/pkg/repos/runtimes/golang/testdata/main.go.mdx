title: "main.go"
---

## High-level description
This code is a simple "Hello World" program written in Go. It demonstrates the basic structure of a Go program and how to print a message to the console using the standard library's `fmt` package.

## Symbols

### `main`
#### Description
The `main` function is the entry point of the Go program. It prints the message "Hello AI World!" to the console.

#### Inputs
This function does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This function does not return any values.

#### Internal Logic
1. The function uses the `fmt.Println` function to print the string "Hello AI World!" to the console.
2. The `Println` function automatically adds a newline character at the end of the output.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| fmt | Used for formatted I/O operations, in this case, printing to the console |

## Notes
1. This code is located in the `testdata` directory of the `golang` runtime in the `runtimes` repository. It's likely used as a simple test case or example for the Go runtime implementation.
2. The package name is `main`, which is required for executable Go programs.
3. The code follows Go's standard formatting conventions, with proper indentation and no semicolons (they are automatically inserted by the Go compiler).

While this code is very simple, it serves as a basic example of a Go program and can be used to verify that the Go runtime is correctly set up and functioning in the context of the larger project.
