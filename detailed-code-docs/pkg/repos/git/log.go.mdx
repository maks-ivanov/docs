### `log`
#### Description
`log` is a package-level variable that is initialized using the `mvl.Package()` function. It is likely used as a logger for the `git` package, providing a centralized way to handle logging throughout the package.

#### Inputs
This variable doesn't have inputs as it's not a function.

#### Outputs
This variable doesn't have explicit outputs as it's not a function.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/mvl | Provides the `Package()` function used to initialize the `log` variable |

## Notes
1. The `log` variable is likely used throughout other files in the `git` package for logging purposes.
2. The exact functionality and methods available on the `log` variable depend on what the `mvl.Package()` function returns.
3. This setup allows for consistent logging across the `git` package, which can be useful for debugging, tracing, and monitoring the package's operations.
