## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for Git operations in the `git` package. It tests the `fetch` and `Checkout` functions, which are responsible for fetching a specific commit from a Git repository and checking out that commit to a local directory.

## Symbols

### `TestFetch`
#### Description
This function tests the `fetch` operation, which retrieves a specific commit from a Git repository.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | Testing object for reporting test failures |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `fetch` function with a background context, test cache home directory, a GitHub repository URL, and a specific commit hash.
2. Asserts that no error is returned from the `fetch` operation.

### `TestCheckout`
#### Description
This function tests the `Checkout` operation, which checks out a specific commit to a local directory.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | Testing object for reporting test failures |

#### Internal Logic
1. Constructs the path for the commit directory.
2. Removes the commit directory if it exists.
3. Calls the `Checkout` function with a background context, test cache home directory, a GitHub repository URL, the test commit hash, and the commit directory path.
4. Asserts that no error is returned from the `Checkout` operation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| context | Provides the Context type for managing cancellation and deadlines |
| os | Used for file system operations |
| path/filepath | Used for manipulating file paths |
| testing | Provides testing infrastructure |
| github.com/adrg/xdg | Used to get the cache file path |
| github.com/samber/lo | Provides utility functions (lo.Must) |
| github.com/stretchr/testify/require | Provides assertion functions for testing |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| testCacheHome | string | (dynamically generated) | The cache directory path for testing |
| testCommit | string | "f9d0ca6559d0b7c78da7f413fc4faf87ae9b8919" | The specific Git commit hash used for testing |

## Error Handling
The tests use `require.NoError(t, err)` to assert that no errors occur during the operations. If an error is returned, the test will fail.
