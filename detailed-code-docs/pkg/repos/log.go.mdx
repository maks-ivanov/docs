title: "log.go"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a package named `repos` and sets up a logging mechanism using the `mvl` package from the `gptscript-ai/gptscript` project. The purpose of this file is to establish a logging instance that can be used throughout the `repos` package.

## Symbols

### `log`
#### Description
`log` is a package-level variable that initializes a logger using the `mvl.Package()` function. This logger is intended to be used for logging operations within the `repos` package.

#### Inputs
This symbol doesn't have explicit inputs as it's a variable declaration.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| log | mvl.Logger (assumed) | An instance of a logger from the `mvl` package |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/mvl | Provides logging functionality |

## Notes
1. The `mvl` package is likely a custom logging package developed for the gptscript project. Its full name "mvl" is not immediately clear from this context, but it's presumably related to logging or monitoring.

2. The use of `mvl.Package()` suggests that this function returns a logger instance configured for package-level logging. This is a common pattern in Go to create a package-scoped logger.

3. This file is very minimal, serving only to set up a logger for the `repos` package. The actual usage of this logger would be seen in other files within the same package.

4. The logging setup in this file is similar to the one seen in the related `gptscript.go` file, which also uses `var log = mvl.Package()`. This indicates a consistent logging approach across different packages in the project.

5. No specific log levels or configurations are set in this file. It's likely that the `mvl.Package()` function sets up some default configuration, or that configuration is handled elsewhere in the project.

6. Developers working with this package would use the `log` variable to perform logging operations, such as `log.Info()`, `log.Error()`, etc., depending on the methods provided by the `mvl` package.

This simple setup allows for consistent and centralized logging throughout the `repos` package, which can be crucial for debugging and monitoring the application's behavior.
