## High-level description
This code defines a package `download` that provides functionality to download and extract files from a URL. The main function `Extract` downloads a file from a given URL, verifies its integrity using a SHA256 digest, and extracts its contents to a specified target directory.

## Code Structure
The `Extract` function is the main entry point of this package. It uses various standard library packages and a third-party archiver package to handle the download, verification, and extraction process.

## Symbols

### `Extract`
#### Description
This function downloads a file from a given URL, verifies its integrity, and extracts its contents to a specified target directory.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the operation |
| downloadURL | string | The URL to download the file from |
| digest | string | The expected SHA256 digest of the downloaded file |
| targetDir | string | The directory where the contents should be extracted |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | error | An error if any step of the process fails |

#### Internal Logic
1. Remove the target directory if it exists
2. Create the target directory
3. Create a temporary file for downloading
4. Download the file from the URL
5. Calculate the SHA256 digest of the downloaded file
6. Verify the calculated digest matches the expected digest
7. Determine if the downloaded file is an executable or an archive
8. If it's an executable, copy it to the target directory
9. If it's an archive, extract its contents to the target directory
10. Handle various file types (directories, symlinks, regular files) during extraction
11. Set appropriate permissions and timestamps for extracted files

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/mholt/archiver/v4 | Used for archive extraction |

## Error Handling
The function returns an error if any step of the process fails, including directory creation, file download, digest verification, or extraction.

## Performance Considerations
- The function uses `io.TeeReader` to calculate the digest while downloading, which avoids reading the file twice.
- It uses a temporary file for downloading, which helps manage memory usage for large files.

## Side Effects
- Creates and removes directories and files on the local filesystem
- Downloads files from the internet
