## High-level description
The `pkg/parser` directory contains the implementation of a parser for GPTScript, a domain-specific language for defining and working with AI tools. The parser is responsible for processing GPTScript input, extracting tool parameters, and creating structured representations of GPTScript documents and tools.

## What does it do?
The parser in this directory performs the following main tasks:

1. Reads GPTScript input from a provided source (e.g., a file or string).
2. Processes the input line by line, identifying different components such as tool definitions, parameters, instructions, and metadata.
3. Handles special cases like comments, blank lines, and separators.
4. Constructs a structured representation of the GPTScript document, including tools, text nodes, and global variables.
5. Extracts and organizes metadata associated with tools.
6. Provides functionality to parse input and output filters for tools.
7. Offers options for customizing the parsing process, such as assigning global variables or specifying file locations.

The parser enables developers to work with GPTScript programmatically by converting the text-based script into structured data that can be easily manipulated and used within applications.

## Key Files

1. `parser.go`: This file contains the main implementation of the parser. It defines the core parsing functions, data structures, and helper methods used to process GPTScript input.

   Key components in this file include:
   - `Parse` function: The main entry point for parsing GPTScript input into a `Document` structure.
   - `ParseTools` function: A specialized function for extracting tool definitions from the input.
   - `parse` function: The internal function that performs the actual line-by-line parsing of the input.
   - Data structures like `Document`, `Node`, `TextNode`, and `ToolNode` to represent the parsed content.
   - Helper functions for normalizing input, processing parameters, and handling special cases.

2. `parser_test.go`: This file contains unit tests for the parser implementation. It includes tests for various aspects of the parsing process, ensuring the correct functionality of the parser.

   Key test functions in this file include:
   - `TestHashBang`: Tests the detection of valid GPTScript hashbangs.
   - `TestParseGlobals`: Tests parsing of global variables and tool definitions.
   - `TestParseSkip`: Tests parsing of multiple tools, text nodes, and skip directives.
   - `TestParseInput` and `TestParseOutput`: Test parsing of input and output filters.
   - `TestParseMetaData`: Tests parsing of metadata associated with tools.

## Dependencies
The parser relies on the following external libraries:

1. `github.com/getkin/kin-openapi/openapi3` (version not specified):
   - Used for OpenAPI schema definitions, likely for validating tool parameters or input/output schemas.

2. `github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/types` (version not specified):
   - Provides types specific to GPTScript, such as the `Tool` struct used in the parsing process.

3. Testing dependencies:
   - `github.com/hexops/autogold/v2`: Used for comparing expected and actual test results.
   - `github.com/stretchr/testify/assert` and `github.com/stretchr/testify/require`: Used for making assertions in unit tests.

These dependencies were chosen to provide robust schema validation (OpenAPI), leverage existing GPTScript type definitions, and facilitate comprehensive testing of the parser implementation.

## Configuration
The parser does not use explicit configuration files or environment variables. However, it provides configuration options through the `Options` type, which can be passed to the `Parse` and `ParseTools` functions. These options allow customization of the parsing process, such as:

- Assigning global variables
- Specifying file locations for error reporting
- Setting a global model for tools
- Providing default tools

Example usage of options:
```go
doc, err := Parse(input, parser.AssignGlobals(true), parser.Location("path/to/file.gpt"))
```

The parser also uses a `context` struct internally to manage the parsing state, but this is not directly configurable by users of the package.
