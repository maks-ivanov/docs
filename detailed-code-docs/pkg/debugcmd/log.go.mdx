## High-level description
This file defines a package-level variable `log` in the `debugcmd` package. It initializes the `log` variable using the `mvl.Package()` function from an external package `github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/mvl`.

## Symbols

### `log`
#### Description
`log` is a package-level variable that is initialized using the `mvl.Package()` function. It is likely used for logging purposes within the `debugcmd` package.

#### Inputs
This variable doesn't have inputs as it's not a function.

#### Outputs
The type of `log` is not explicitly specified in the code, but it is the return type of `mvl.Package()`.

## Dependencies

This file is quite minimal and serves primarily to set up a logging mechanism for the `debugcmd` package. The actual functionality and usage of the `log` variable would be seen in other files within the package or in code that imports this package.
