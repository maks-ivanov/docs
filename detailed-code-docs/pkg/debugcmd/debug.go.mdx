## High-level description
This code defines a `WrappedCmd` struct and associated methods for executing and managing external commands in a Go program. It provides functionality for running commands, capturing their output, and handling errors in a controlled manner.

## Code Structure
The main symbols in the code are:
1. `WrappedCmd`: The primary struct that encapsulates an `exec.Cmd` and provides additional functionality.
2. `recorder`: A helper struct used to record command output.
3. `writer`: A helper struct used to write command output.

These symbols are interconnected, with `WrappedCmd` using `recorder` to capture output, and `writer` being used to write output to the `recorder`.

## Symbols

### `WrappedCmd`
#### Description
A struct that wraps an `exec.Cmd` and provides additional functionality for running commands and capturing their output.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| c | *exec.Cmd | The underlying exec.Cmd |
| r | recorder | A recorder for capturing output |
| Env | []string | Environment variables for the command |
| Dir | string | Working directory for the command |

#### Methods

##### `Stdout() string`
Returns the captured standard output of the command.

##### `Run() error`
Executes the command and returns any error encountered.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up the command environment and working directory if specified.
- Runs the command and captures its output.
- If an error occurs, it includes the captured output in the error message.

### `New(ctx context.Context, arg string, args ...string) *WrappedCmd`
#### Description
Creates a new `WrappedCmd` instance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the command |
| arg | string | The command to run |
| args | ...string | Additional arguments for the command |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| *WrappedCmd | *WrappedCmd | A new WrappedCmd instance |

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a new `exec.Cmd` with the given context and arguments.
- Calls `setupDebug` to configure output capturing.

### `recorder`
#### Description
A struct used to record command output.

#### Methods

##### `Stdout() string`
Returns the captured standard output.

##### `dump() string`
Writes the captured output to stdout/stderr and returns error messages.

### `writer`
#### Description
A struct that implements `io.Writer` to capture command output.

#### Method

##### `Write(data []byte) (int, error)`
Writes data to the recorder, differentiating between stdout and stderr.

### `setupDebug(w *WrappedCmd)`
#### Description
Configures the output capturing for a `WrappedCmd` based on debug settings.

#### Internal Logic
- If debug logging is enabled, sets stdout and stderr to os.Stdout and os.Stderr.
- Otherwise, sets up custom writers to capture output in the recorder.

## Side Effects
- The code interacts with the file system through `os.Stdout` and `os.Stderr`.
- It may modify the environment and working directory of the executed command.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| context | For handling command contexts |
| fmt | For formatting strings and errors |
| os | For interacting with the operating system |
| os/exec | For executing external commands |
| strings | For string manipulation |
| sync | For synchronization primitives |

## Error Handling
The code uses Go's standard error handling mechanisms. Errors from command execution are wrapped with additional context (captured output) when returned.
