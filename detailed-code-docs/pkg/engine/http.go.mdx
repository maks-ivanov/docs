title: "http.go"

## High-level description
This code defines the `runHTTP` function within the `Engine` struct, which handles HTTP-based tool execution in the GPTScript engine. It processes HTTP requests, manages environment variables, and handles special cases for daemon URLs.

## Code Structure
The main function `runHTTP` interacts with other parts of the codebase, particularly the `Engine` struct and `types.Program`. It uses the `startDaemon` method (not shown in this file) and relies on the standard Go `http` package for making requests.

## Symbols

### `func (e *Engine) runHTTP(ctx context.Context, prg *types.Program, tool types.Tool, input string) (cmdRet *Return, cmdErr error)`

#### Description
This function executes an HTTP-based tool within the GPTScript engine. It handles environment variable expansion, URL parsing, and special cases for daemon URLs. It then makes an HTTP request and processes the response.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the operation |
| prg | *types.Program | The program containing the tool set |
| tool | types.Tool | The tool to be executed |
| input | string | The input for the tool |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cmdRet | *Return | The result of the tool execution |
| cmdErr | error | Any error encountered during execution |

#### Internal Logic
1. Process environment variables
2. Extract and expand the tool URL from the instructions
3. Parse the URL
4. Handle special case for daemon URLs (ending with `.daemon.gptscript.local`)
5. If the tool is blocking, return the URL without making a request
6. Prepare and send an HTTP POST request
7. Process the response, handling different content types
8. Return the result or any encountered error

## Side Effects
- Makes HTTP requests to external URLs
- May start a daemon process (via `e.startDaemon`)

## Dependencies
- `net/http`: For making HTTP requests
- `encoding/json`: For JSON processing
- `net/url`: For URL parsing
- `os`: For environment variable expansion

## Constants
- `DaemonURLSuffix = ".daemon.gptscript.local"`: Used to identify daemon URLs

## Error Handling
The function returns errors for various scenarios, including URL parsing failures, HTTP request errors, and invalid tool references.

## Performance Considerations
The function makes network requests, which can be time-consuming. It also performs JSON unmarshaling, which may impact performance for large payloads.

## TODOs
There is a comment indicating a "dumb hack" for handling JSON-encoded strings, suggesting a potential area for improvement.

```go
// This is dumb hack when something returns a string in JSON format, just decode it to a string
```

This comment suggests that the current implementation might not be ideal and could be improved in the future.
