title: "log.go"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a package named `engine` and sets up a logging mechanism using the `mvl` package from the `github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/mvl` module. The main purpose is to create a logger instance for the `engine` package.

## Symbols

### `log`
#### Description
`log` is a package-level variable that holds a logger instance created by calling the `Package()` function from the `mvl` package. This logger is likely used throughout the `engine` package for logging purposes.

#### Inputs
This variable doesn't have direct inputs as it's initialized using a function call.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| log | mvl.Logger (assumed) | A logger instance for the engine package |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/mvl | Provides logging functionality through the `Package()` function |

## Notes
1. The code is very concise and only sets up a logger for the `engine` package.
2. The actual implementation of the `mvl.Package()` function is not provided, so the exact behavior and features of the logger are not clear from this code alone.
3. It's likely that this logger is used in other files within the `engine` package to provide consistent logging capabilities.
4. The `mvl` package seems to be a custom logging solution for the gptscript project, as it's part of the same repository structure.

Given the brevity of the code, there are no complex structures, error handling, or configuration options to document. The main takeaway is that this file sets up a package-level logger for use in the `engine` package.
