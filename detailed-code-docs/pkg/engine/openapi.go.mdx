## High-level description
This code implements functionality for running OpenAPI tools within the GPTScript engine. It provides two main methods: `runOpenAPIRevamp` and `runOpenAPI`, which handle different aspects of OpenAPI operations such as listing, getting schemas, and executing API calls based on OpenAPI specifications.

## Code Structure
The main symbols in this code are methods of the `Engine` struct: `runOpenAPIRevamp` and `runOpenAPI`. These methods interact with the `openapi` package to perform various operations. The `runOpenAPI` method is the primary implementation, while `runOpenAPIRevamp` is an alternative implementation that can be enabled via an environment variable.

## References
This code references the following packages:
- `github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/env`
- `github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/openapi`
- `github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/types`
- `github.com/tidwall/gjson`

## Symbols

### `runOpenAPIRevamp`
#### Description
This method is an alternative implementation for running OpenAPI tools. It supports three operations: listing tools, getting schemas, and running operations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tool | types.Tool | The tool to be executed |
| input | string | The input for the tool |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| *Return | *Return | The result of the operation |
| error | error | Any error that occurred during execution |

#### Internal Logic
1. Parse the tool instructions to extract command, source, and filter.
2. Based on the command (list, getSchema, or run), perform the corresponding operation using the `openapi` package.
3. Handle filtering of operations if a filter is specified.
4. Return the result as a JSON string.

### `runOpenAPI`
#### Description
This is the main method for running OpenAPI tools. It constructs and executes HTTP requests based on the OpenAPI specification.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tool | types.Tool | The tool to be executed |
| input | string | The input for the tool |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| *Return | *Return | The result of the operation |
| error | error | Any error that occurred during execution |

#### Internal Logic
1. Extract and parse the OpenAPI instructions from the tool.
2. Construct an HTTP request based on the instructions, handling path parameters, query parameters, headers, and cookies.
3. Handle authentication if required.
4. Handle the request body based on the content type (JSON, plain text, or multipart form-data).
5. Execute the HTTP request and return the response.

#### Performance Considerations
The method uses `http.DefaultClient` for making HTTP requests, which may not be optimal for high-performance scenarios. Consider using a custom HTTP client with appropriate timeout and connection pool settings for production use.

### `ptr`
#### Description
A generic helper function that returns a pointer to the provided value.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | T | The value to create a pointer for |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| *T | *T | A pointer to the input value |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| encoding/json | JSON encoding and decoding |
| net/http | Making HTTP requests |
| net/url | URL parsing and manipulation |
| github.com/tidwall/gjson | JSON parsing and querying |
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/openapi | OpenAPI operations |
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/types | Custom types |
| github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/pkg/env | Environment variable handling |

## Error Handling
The code uses idiomatic Go error handling, returning errors when operations fail. It wraps errors with additional context using `fmt.Errorf` to provide more informative error messages.

## Configuration
The code checks for an environment variable `GPTSCRIPT_OPENAPI_REVAMP` to determine whether to use the revamped OpenAPI implementation.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| GPTSCRIPT_OPENAPI_REVAMP | string | "false" | If set to "true", uses the revamped OpenAPI implementation |

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
