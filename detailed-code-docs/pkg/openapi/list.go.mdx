## High-level description
This code defines functionality for listing and filtering operations from an OpenAPI specification. It provides structures and functions to extract operation information and filter operations based on user-defined criteria.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main structures: `OperationList` and `Operation`. The primary function `List` processes an OpenAPI specification and filters operations based on a given filter string. The `MatchFilters` function is used to support wildcard matching for operation IDs.

## Symbols

### `OperationList`
#### Description
A structure that holds a map of operations, where the key is the operation ID and the value is an `Operation` struct.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Operations | map[string]Operation | A map of operation IDs to Operation structs |

### `Operation`
#### Description
A structure that represents an individual operation in the OpenAPI specification.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Description | string | The description of the operation |
| Summary | string | A summary of the operation |

### `List`
#### Description
This function processes an OpenAPI specification and filters operations based on a given filter string.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *openapi3.T | A pointer to the OpenAPI specification |
| filter | string | A filter string to match against operation IDs |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| OperationList | OperationList | A list of filtered operations |
| error | error | An error, if any occurred during processing |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterate through all paths and operations in the OpenAPI specification.
2. For each operation, check if it matches the given filter:
   - If the filter is empty or "&lt;none&gt;", include all operations.
   - If the filter contains a wildcard (*), use `MatchFilters` function.
   - Otherwise, perform an exact match on the operation ID.
3. If the operation matches, add it to the `operations` map.
4. Return the `OperationList` containing all matched operations.

### `MatchFilters`
#### Description
This function checks if an operation ID matches any of the given filter patterns, supporting wildcard matching.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filters | []string | A slice of filter patterns |
| operationID | string | The operation ID to match against |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| bool | bool | True if the operation ID matches any filter, false otherwise |
| error | error | An error, if any occurred during matching |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterate through each filter pattern.
2. Use `filepath.Match` to check if the operation ID matches the current filter pattern.
3. If a match is found, return true immediately.
4. If no match is found after checking all filters, return false.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| path/filepath | Used for wildcard matching in `MatchFilters` function |
| strings | Used for string manipulation and comparison |
| github.com/getkin/kin-openapi/openapi3 | Provides OpenAPI v3 specification types and utilities |

## Error Handling
The code returns errors from the `MatchFilters` function if there's an issue with the filter pattern. These errors are propagated up to the caller of the `List` function.

## Performance Considerations
The `List` function iterates through all paths and operations in the OpenAPI specification, which could be potentially slow for very large specifications. The use of a map for storing matched operations ensures constant-time lookups and insertions.
