## High-level description
This code defines a `SysDaemon` function in the `daemon` package. Its primary purpose is to execute a command as a daemon process, handling input and output streams, and providing a mechanism for graceful termination.

## Symbols

### `SysDaemon`
#### Description
`SysDaemon` is a function that runs a specified command as a daemon process. It sets up context cancellation, handles standard input, and manages the execution of the command with proper output redirection.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't have any explicit input parameters.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | error | Returns any error encountered during the execution of the command |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a cancellable context.
2. Starts a goroutine to read from standard input and cancel the context when input ends.
3. Prepares the command to be executed using `os.Args[2]` as the command and `os.Args[3:]` as its arguments.
4. Sets up stdout and stderr redirection for the command.
5. Defines a custom cancel function for the command, which handles process termination differently for Windows and other operating systems.
6. Executes the command and returns any error encountered.

## Side Effects
- Reads from standard input (os.Stdin)
- Writes to standard output (os.Stdout) and standard error (os.Stderr)
- Executes a system command

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| context | For creating a cancellable context |
| io | For reading from standard input |
| os | For accessing command-line arguments and standard I/O streams |
| os/exec | For executing system commands |
| runtime | For determining the operating system |

## Error Handling
The function returns any error encountered during the execution of the command. It does not implement any specific error handling mechanisms beyond this.

## Performance Considerations
The function uses a goroutine to handle reading from standard input, which allows for non-blocking I/O operations.

## Platform-specific Behavior
The `cmd.Cancel` function is defined differently based on the operating system:
- On Windows, it kills the process.
- On other operating systems, it sends an interrupt signal to the process.

This distinction ensures proper termination behavior across different platforms.
