## High-level description
The `.markdownlint.yaml` file is a configuration file for the `markdownlint` tool, which is used to enforce style rules in Markdown files. This configuration file specifies which rules should be enabled or disabled when `markdownlint` is run, allowing for customization of the linting process according to the project's needs.

## Code Structure
The file is structured as a YAML configuration, where each line represents a specific rule in `markdownlint`. The rules are identified by their rule IDs (e.g., `MD013`, `MD041`), and each rule is set to either `true` or `false` to indicate whether it should be enforced or ignored.

## Symbols

### `default`
#### Description
The `default` setting determines whether all rules are enabled by default. Setting it to `true` means that all rules are enabled unless explicitly disabled.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| default | boolean | Indicates whether all rules are enabled by default. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | N/A |

### `MD013`
#### Description
This rule checks for line length in Markdown files. Setting it to `false` disables the enforcement of a maximum line length.

### `MD041`
#### Description
This rule requires the first line of a Markdown file to be a top-level heading. Setting it to `false` disables this requirement.

### `MD033`
#### Description
This rule disallows the use of inline HTML in Markdown files. Setting it to `false` allows inline HTML.

### `MD045`
#### Description
This rule checks for the presence of alt text in images. Setting it to `false` disables this check.

### `MD051`
#### Description
This rule checks for proper link fragments. Setting it to `false` disables this check.

### `MD036`
#### Description
This rule disallows the use of emphasis (e.g., bold or italic) as a heading. Setting it to `false` allows emphasis to be used as a heading.

### `MD001`
#### Description
This rule enforces proper heading increment (e.g., H1 followed by H2). Setting it to `false` disables this enforcement.

### `MD040`
#### Description
This rule requires fenced code blocks to have a language specified. Setting it to `false` disables this requirement.

### `MD029`
#### Description
This rule checks for ordered list item prefix consistency. Setting it to `false` disables this check.

### `MD026`
#### Description
This rule checks for trailing punctuation in headings. Setting it to `false` disables this check.
