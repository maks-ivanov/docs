title: "setup.py"
---

## High-level description
This file, `setup.py`, is a minimal Python setup script that serves as a shim for package detection on GitHub. Its primary purpose is to enable GitHub to recognize the package, while the actual build process is managed using Poetry.

## Symbols

### `setuptools.setup()`
#### Description
This function is called to provide basic package information to setuptools. In this case, it only specifies the package name "cassiopeia".

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | The name of the package, set to "cassiopeia" |

#### Outputs
This function doesn't explicitly return a value, but it sets up the package configuration for setuptools.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| setuptools | Used to provide basic package setup functionality |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| name | str | "cassiopeia" | Specifies the name of the package |

## Additional Notes
1. The script includes a shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/env python`) allowing it to be executed directly on Unix-like systems.
2. The actual build process is not handled by this script but is instead managed by Poetry, as indicated in the comment.
3. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ensures that the `setuptools.setup()` function is only called when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module.

This minimal setup script is likely used as a workaround to make the project detectable by GitHub's package detection mechanisms, while the actual package management and build process are handled separately using Poetry.
