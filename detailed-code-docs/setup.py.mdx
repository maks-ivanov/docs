title: "setup.py"
---

## High-level description
The `setup.py` file is a minimal setup script for a Python package named "cassiopeia". Its primary purpose is to serve as a shim to enable GitHub to detect the package, while the actual build and dependency management are handled by Poetry, a dependency management tool for Python.

## Code Structure
The script uses the `setuptools` library to define the package name. The script is executed as a standalone program, which is typical for `setup.py` files.

## Symbols

### `setuptools.setup`
#### Description
The `setuptools.setup` function is used to define the metadata and configuration for the Python package. In this script, it is used to specify the package name "cassiopeia".

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | The name of the package, which is "cassiopeia" in this case. |

#### Outputs
There are no direct outputs from this function in the context of this script. It is used to configure the package for distribution.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| setuptools | Used to define the package configuration and metadata. |

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this script. It assumes that `setuptools` is correctly installed and available in the environment.

## Logging
There is no logging implemented in this script.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or additional notes in the code. 

This `setup.py` file is intentionally minimal because the actual package management and build processes are handled by Poetry, which is not directly referenced in this script but is implied by the comment.
