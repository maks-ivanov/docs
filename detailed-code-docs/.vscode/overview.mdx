## High-level description
The `.vscode` directory houses configuration files that tailor the Visual Studio Code editor to a specific project. These settings ensure consistent code style, enable debugging, and integrate language-specific tools.

## What does it do?
This directory configures the Visual Studio Code editor for a project involving Rust, Python, and potentially JavaScript. It sets up debugging for Rust code, enforces Python code style using the Black formatter, and integrates the Rust Analyzer and ESLint tools. The settings in this directory streamline development by automating tasks and ensuring code quality.

## Key Files
- **`launch.json`**: Defines debugging configurations for the Rust portion of the project. It specifies how to build and run different parts of the codebase using the LLDB debugger within Visual Studio Code.
- **`settings.json`**: Contains project-specific settings for Visual Studio Code. This includes configuring extensions like the Rust Analyzer and ESLint, setting the default Python formatter to Black, and enabling Python type checking.
