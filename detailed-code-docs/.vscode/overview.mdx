## High-level description
This `launch.json` file is a Visual Studio Code configuration file that defines debug configurations for the project. It specifies two launch configurations: one for launching the UI using Nuxt.js and another for launching the server using Go.

## Code Structure
The file contains a single JSON object with a "configurations" array, which includes two launch configurations: "Launch UI" and "Launch Server".

## Symbols

### Launch UI Configuration
#### Description
This configuration is used to launch and debug the UI part of the application, which appears to be built with Nuxt.js.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | The name of the configuration |
| type | string | The type of debugger to use (Node.js in this case) |
| request | string | The type of request (launch) |
| program | string | The path to the Nuxt.js executable |
| args | array | Arguments passed to the Nuxt.js command |
| skipFiles | array | Patterns for files to skip during debugging |

#### Internal Logic
This configuration runs the Nuxt.js development server using the `nuxt dev` command, skipping internal Node.js files during debugging.

### Launch Server Configuration
#### Description
This configuration is used to launch and debug the server part of the application, which is written in Go.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | The name of the configuration |
| type | string | The type of debugger to use (Go in this case) |
| request | string | The type of request (launch) |
| mode | string | The debug mode (debug) |
| program | string | The main Go file to run |
| args | array | Arguments passed to the Go program |

#### Internal Logic
This configuration runs the Go program specified in `main.go` with the `--server` argument, enabling debugging.
