title: "launch.json"
---

## High-level description
This file, `.vscode/launch.json`, defines debugging configurations for a Rust project within the Visual Studio Code editor. It specifies how to build and launch different executables and tests using the LLDB debugger.

## Table of contents
- `configurations`: An array containing debug configurations.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a single JSON object with a "configurations" property. The "configurations" property is an array of debug configuration objects. Each configuration object defines how to launch and debug a specific part of the project, such as an executable or unit tests.

## Symbols
### `configurations`
#### Description
An array of debug configuration objects. Each object represents a different debugging setup.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a top-level property.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a top-level property.

#### Internal Logic
Each configuration object within the array typically includes the following fields:

- **`type`**: Specifies the debugger type, here consistently "lldb".
- **`request`**: Indicates the debugging mode, either "launch" to start a new instance or "attach" to an existing process.
- **`name`**: A user-friendly name for the configuration displayed in the VS Code debugging interface.
- **`cargo`**:  Contains instructions for Cargo, the Rust build system.
    - **`args`**: An array of arguments passed to Cargo. These often specify build target, build options, and the package to work with.
    - **`filter`** (optional): Used to narrow down the build target within a Cargo workspace.
- **`args`**: An array of arguments passed to the executable being debugged.
- **`cwd`**: The working directory for the debugging session.

## Configuration
This file itself acts as a configuration file for the Visual Studio Code debugger. Each configuration object within the "configurations" array defines specific settings for debugging different parts of the project.
